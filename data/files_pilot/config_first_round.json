                    "text": "Samuel Shute = Samuel Shute ( January 12 , 1662 \u2013 April 15 , 1742 ) was an English military officer and royal governor of the provinces of Massachusetts and New Hampshire . After serving in the Nine Years ' War and the War of the Spanish Succession , he was appointed by King George I as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716 . His tenure was marked by virulent disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly on a variety of issues , and by poorly conducted diplomacy with respect to the Native American Wabanaki Confederacy of northern New England that led to Dummer 's War ( 1722 \u2013 1725 ) . Although Shute was partly responsible for the breakdown in negotiations with the Wabanakis , he returned to England in early 1723 to procure resolutions to his ongoing disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly , leaving conduct of the war to Lieutenant Governor William Dummer . His protests resulted in the issuance in 1725 of the Explanatory Charter , essentially confirming his position in the disputes with the assembly . He did not return to New England , being replaced as governor in 1728 by William Burnet , and refused to be considered for reappointment after Burnet 's sudden death in 1729 . Thomas Hutchinson ( Massachusetts royal governor in the early 1770s ) , in his history of Massachusetts , described Shute 's tenure as governor as the most contentious since the Antinomian Controversy of the 1630s . = = Early life = = Samuel Shute was born in London , England on January 12 , 1662 . He was the eldest of six children of Benjamin Shute , a London merchant . His mother , identified in sources as Elizabeth , Patience , or Mary , was the daughter of Joseph Caryl , a dissenting Presbyterian clergyman . His brother John , afterward Lord Barrington , became an influential member of parliament , political leader of religious Dissenters , and confidant of King George I. Shute was educated by Rev. Charles Morton , who afterward emigrated to New England . Shute then attended the University of Leyden in Holland and subsequently entered the English army , serving under William III . In the War of the Spanish Succession Shute served in the campaigns of the Duke of Marlborough in the 3rd Dragoon Guards . He was a captain of that cavalry regiment when he was wounded at the 1704 Battle of Blenheim ; by the end of the war he had a full promotion to lieutenant-colonel and a brevet promotion to colonel . Upon the accession of King George I in 1714 , Colonel Elizeus Burges was commissioned as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire . Massachusetts agents Jeremiah Dummer and Jonathan Belcher , representing opponents of a land bank proposal that Burges had promised to support , bribed him \u00a3 1,000 to resign before he left England . Dummer and Belcher were then instrumental in promoting Shute as an alternative to Burges , believing among other things that he was likely to be well received in New England because he was from a prominent Dissenting family . = = Governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire = = Shute arrived in Boston on October 4 , 1716 , where he began a difficult and contentious tenure in office . He signaled his partisanship by first taking up residence with Paul Dudley , son of the last-appointed governor Joseph Dudley and a land bank opponent , rather than Acting Governor William Tailer . = = = New Hampshire = = = Shute 's administration of New Hampshire was not as troublesome as that of Massachusetts , but issues began early . Lieutenant Governor George Vaughan , who had been acting as governor for a year before Shute 's arrival , insisted on claiming full authority to act when Shute was not present in that province . Against direct orders from Shute , Vaughan , in Shute 's absence , dissolved the assembly and dismissed councillor Samuel Penhallow . In September 1717 Shute , with the concurrence of his council , suspended Vaughan , recalled the assembly , and reinstated Penhallow . Vaughan was afterward formally replaced as lieutenant governor by John Wentworth . One positive event connected with the administration of Governor Shute was the resettlement of a large number of Scotch emigrants from the north of Ireland . In early 1718 Reverend William Boyd arrived from Ulster to petition for land on behalf of a number of Presbyterian families seeking to emigrate . Shute favorably received the emissary , and several ships with migrants arrived in August 1718 . They eventually settled in New Hampshire , where they founded the town of Londonderry . This was the beginning of a major wave of Scotch-Irish migration to both New Hampshire and Massachusetts . Shute also made other grants of townships in land that is part of the modern state of New Hampshire . However , much of southwestern New Hampshire was at the time disputed between the two provinces Shute governed , and grants he made in that area went to Massachusetts interests . This upset a number of New Hampshire politicians , notably Lieutenant Governor Wentworth . Wentworth used discontent over these grants , combined with competing ones that he issued himself under New Hampshire authority , to build a power base that would eventually ( after his death ) successfully lobby for the separation of the governorships . = = = Disputes with Massachusetts assembly = = = Shute engaged in a wide array of disputes with the Massachusetts General Court ( the provincial assembly ) concerning the royal prerogative and other issues . During his administration the assembly successfully expanded its authority at the expense of the governor 's , which permanently affected relations between later governors and the assembly until independence . Currency was a major issue which divided the province politically : a large populist faction supported the inflationary issuance of paper currency , while two economically powerful groups supported competing proposals for dealing with the currency problem . The faction that had secured Burges ' appointment supported a private land bank proposal that would issue bills secured by private property , while the Dudleys and their supporters , who backed Shute , favored the idea of paper that was backed by gold . A major opponent representing the popular factions in the province was Elisha Cooke , Jr . , a politician and major landowner in Maine , which was then part of Massachusetts . Cooke 's opposition was rooted in disagreements on the currency , and the matter of logging in the Maine territory . During the Dudley administration logging interests had widely flouted the 1711 White Pine Act , British Parliamentary legislation that reserved large trees on ungranted public lands for the government 's use as ship masts . Shute sought to crack down on this behavior , earning the enmity of Cooke and others . Cooke 's early challenges to the law were legal in nature , but rapidly became political . In 1718 Cooke was nominated to serve on the Governor 's Council by the assembly , but Shute vetoed the choice . The assembly then appointed Cooke to be its speaker in 1720 . This began a constitutional argument about the governor 's powers , for Shute refused to accept Cooke 's appointment , claiming it was within his authority to veto it . The assembly , for its part , refused to appoint anyone else , and the following year seated a different speaker before Shute was given notice of his election . Shute 's disagreements with the assembly also extended to its ability to adjourn for short periods of time . The assembly could only formally be called into session and adjourned by the governor , and provided one means by which the governor could control the assembly ; Shute took issue with a temporary adjournment of six days . This dispute combined with his refusal to approve Cooke 's appointment prompted the assembly to become strongly opposed to Shute on virtually all actions . This recalcitrance extended to a denial of any attempts on the part of the governor to fund the improvement of defenses on the province 's northern and eastern frontiers , where there were ongoing difficulties with the Wabanaki Confederacy . On of Shute 's more notorious controversies concerned the assembly 's refusal to grant him a regular salary . This was a frequent source of dispute , and it spilled over into other matters : Shute 's veto of Cooke 's appointment in 1719 resulted in a reduction of his salary grant . The salary issue would continue to be a regular source of disagreement between the provincial assembly and the governor until the Belcher administration of the 1730s . Shute attempted to impose press censorship after Cooke partisans published pamphlets harshly criticizing his policies , but the assembly refused to pass the proposed legislation , effectively legitimizing freedom of the press in the province . Boston 's conservative religious establishment also expressed reservations over his attendance at Anglican church services , as well as his sometimes ostentatious and loud parties . = = = Indian policy = = = When the War of the Spanish Succession ended in 1713 , its North American theater ( where it was known as Queen Anne 's War ) came to an uneasy end . The Treaty of Utrecht that ended the war did not acknowledge any Native American claims , and contained ambiguous language concerning the French cession of Acadia . The contested areas of northern New England included present-day Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and eastern Maine . Joseph Dudley had in 1713 negotiated an end to hostilities with the tribes in Massachusetts and New Hampshire , but the written form of the Treaty of Portsmouth differed in content from the orally negotiated agreements , and its terms were being violated by British settlements encroaching on Abenaki lands on Maine 's coasts and rivers . Furthermore , neighboring Nova Scotia 's Mi 'kmaq had not signed any treaties . Both France and Britain claimed the claimed suzerainty over the tribes inhabiting the contested area . The tribes , loosely organized into the Wabanaki Confederacy , asserted their own sovereignty and ownership of much of the disputed area . In a meeting at Arrowsic , Maine in 1717 Shute and representatives of some of the Wabanakis attempted to reach some agreement concerning colonial encroachment on Native lands and the establishment of provincially operated trading posts . The Kennebec sachem ( chief ) Wiwurna objected not only to the establishment of settlements on their lands , but also the construction of forts , and claimed sovereign control of those lands . Shute , who often rudely interrupted Wiwurna , bluntly reasserted British claims to the territory . The Wabanakis were willing to accede to existing illegal settlements if a proper boundary was delineated beyond which settlement would not be allowed ; Shute responded \" We desire only what is our own , and that we will have . \" This ambiguous response , and the treaty that was ultimately agreed , did not satisfy the Wabanakis . Over the next several years settlers continued to encroach on Wabanaki lands east of the Kennebec River , including the construction of block house fortifications on the east side of the Kennebec River . The Wabanakis responded by raiding livestock . Canso , Nova Scotia , a settlement disputed by all three parties but fortified by Nova Scotia and primarily occupied by Massachusetts fishermen , was also a flashpoint for conflict . After receiving complaints of harassment and raids from Canso-based fishermen in 1718 , Shute dispatched a Royal Navy frigate to the area , which seized French ships and goods . Tensions there were further raised when Canso was attacked in 1720 by the Mi 'kmaq . At a conference in 1720 the Wabanakis agreed to pay 400 fur pelts as restitution for property damage done in Maine , leaving four hostages as surety until the pelts were delivered . Shute also protested the presence of the French Jesuit priest Sebastian Rale , who lived among the Kennebec in central Maine , demanding that he be removed . In July 1721 the Wabanakis delivered half the furs , demanded the return of their hostages , and refused to hand over Rale ( who accompanied them to the meeting site ) . Massachusetts made no official response , and raids soon resumed . The Wabanakis then went to extraordinary lengths to produce a written document reasserting their sovereign claims to disputed areas , delineating the areas they claimed , and threatening violence if their territory was violated . Shute dismissed the letter as \" insolent and menacing \" , and sent militia forces to Arrowsic . He also asserted , based on Rale 's influence , that the Wabanaki claims were part of a French intrigue to further French claims to the disputed areas . Following up on this idea , he sent a militia expedition to capture Rale in January 1722 . The force reached the Kennebec village at Norridgewock where Rale was based , but the priest escaped . The militia recovered a strongbox containing his papers ( including communications with French authorities ) , which Shute used to reinforce the claims of French involvement . Shute reiterated British claims of sovereignty over the disputed areas in letters to the Lords of Trade and to Governor General Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil of New France . Vaudreuil in response pointed out that although France claimed sovereignty over the area , the Wabanakis maintained ownership , and suggested that Shute misunderstood the way in which ideas of European and Native American ownership interacted . The raid on Norridgewock and the fortification of the Maine coast brought a predictable response : the Wabanakis went to war , raiding British settlements on the Maine coast in 1722 and seizing shipping vessels off Nova Scotia . On July 25 , 1722 , Shute formally declared war on the Wabanakis , marking a formal start to the conflict often referred to as Dummer 's War , since Lieutenant Governor William Dummer would end up conducting the Massachusetts involvement in the war . = = = Decision to leave = = = Under the leadership of Cooke and others of the \" country party \" , the assembly investigated the province 's expenditures . Finding that some payments of militia had been made fraudulently , the assembly was able to introducing spending bills that very precisely delineated how public funds could be spent ; this represented an increase the assembly 's power at the expense of the governor . The assembly further encroached on the governor 's authority by establishing a committee to oversee the activities of the militia in December 1722 . With the Indian war looming , Shute saw this as a serious threat to his power , and decided that only by returning to London would he be able to correct the situation . Not long after Christmas 1722 Shute sailed for England . = = Later years and legacy = = Upon his arrival in London , Shute presented his many issues to the Privy Council . His opponents were represented by Jeremiah Dummer and Elisha Cooke , the former having long served as colonial agent in London , and the latter being chosen by the assembly to put forward its case . Shute 's arguments were accepted by the council , and only the diplomacy of Dummer convinced the council not to revoke the colonial charter . In 1725 the council issued an explanatory colonial charter confirming Shute 's position on the adjournment issue and the approval of the house speaker , which the provincial assembly reluctantly accepted the following year . Shute was preparing to return to Massachusetts in 1727 when King George I died . This brought about a change of administration in London and a reshuffling of colonial governorships . The Massachusetts and New Hampshire governorships were given to William Burnet , then the governor of New York and New Jersey , and Shute was given a pension . Burnet 's brief administration was dominated by an extended attempt by the governor to secure an annual salary . The sudden death of Burnet in 1729 again opened the Massachusetts and New Hampshire seats . Shute was apparently considered again for the post , but demurred , implicitly offering his support instead to Jonathan Belcher , who was actively seeking the post . Shute , who never married , died in England on Apr. 10 , 1743 . Shutesbury , Massachusetts is named in his honor .",

                    "text": "William Claiborne = William Claiborne ( c . 1600 \u2013 c . 1677 ) ( also spelled \" William Cleyburne \" ) was an English pioneer , surveyor , and an early settler in the colonies / provinces of Virginia and Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay . Claiborne became a wealthy planter , a trader , and a major figure in the politics of the colonies . He was a central figure in the disputes between the colonists of Virginia and the later settling of Maryland , partly because of his earlier trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay , which provoked the first naval military battles in North American waters . Claiborne repeatedly attempted and failed to regain Kent Island from the Maryland Calverts , sometimes by force of arms , after its inclusion in the lands that were granted by a 1632 Royal Charter to the Calvert family ( to Sir George Calvert , first Baron and Lord Baltimore , ( 1579-1632 ) , by the reigning King of England , Charles I , ( 1600 \u2013 1649 , reigned 1625 to execution , 1649 ) , thus becoming Maryland territory . A Puritan , Claiborne sided with Parliament during the English Civil War of 1642 \u2013 1651 and was appointed to a commission charged with subduing and managing the Virginia and Maryland colonies . He played a role in the submission of Virginia to parliamentary rule in this period . Following the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 , he retired from involvement in the politics of the Virginia colony . He died around 1677 at his plantation , \" Romancoke \" , on Virginia 's Pamunkey River . According to historian Robert Brenner , \" William Claiborne may have been the most consistently influential politician in Virginia throughout the whole of the pre-Restoration period \" . = = Early life and emigration to America = = Claiborne was born the county of Kent in England in 1600 to Thomas Clayborn , an alderman and lord mayor from King 's Lynn , Norfolk , who made his living as a small-scale businessman involved in a variety of industries , including the salt and fish trades , and Sarah Smith , the daughter of a London brewer . The family name was spelled alternately as Cleburn , Cleyborne , or Claiborne . William Claiborne , who was baptized on 10 August 1587 , was the younger of two sons . The family 's business was not profitable enough to make it rich , and so Claiborne 's older brother was apprenticed in London , becoming a merchant involved in hosiery and , eventually , the tobacco trade . However , Claiborne was offered a position as a land surveyor in the new colony of Virginia , and arrived at Jamestown , on the north shore of the James River in 1621 . The position carried a 200 acre ( 80 hectare ) land grant , a salary of \u00a3 30 per year , and the promise of fees paid by settlers who needed to have their land grants surveyed . His political acumen quickly made him one of the most successful Virginia colonists , and within four years of his arrival he had secured grants for 1,100 acres ( 445 hectares ) of land and a retroactive salary of \u00a3 60 a year from the Virginia Colony 's council . He also managed to survive the March 1622 attacks by native / Indian Powhatans on the Virginia settlers that killed more than 300 colonists . His financial success was followed by political success , and he gained appointment as Councilor in 1624 and Secretary of State for the Colony in 1626 . Around 1627 , he began to trade for furs with the native Susquehannock Indians from further north on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay and two of its largest tributaries , the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers . To facilitate this trade , Claiborne wanted to establish a trading post on Kent Island in the mid-way of the Chesapeake Bay , which he intended to make the center of a vast mercantile empire along the Atlantic Coast . Claiborne found both financial and political support for the Kent Island venture from London merchants Maurice Thomson , William Cloberry , John de la Barre , and Simon Turgis . = = Kent Island and the first dispute with Maryland = = In 1629 , George Calvert , 1st Baron Baltimore , arrived in Virginia , having traveled south from Avalon , his failed colony on Newfoundland . Calvert was not welcomed by the Virginians , both because his Catholicism offended them as Protestants , and because it was no secret that Calvert desired a charter for a portion of the land that the Virginians considered their own . After a brief stay , Calvert returned to England to press for just such a charter , and Claiborne , in his capacity as Secretary of State of Virginia colony , was sent to England to argue the Virginians ' case . This happened to be to Claiborne 's private advantage , as he was also trying to complete the arrangements for the trading post on Kent Island . Calvert , a former high official in the government of King James I , asked the Privy Council for permission to build a colony , to be called Carolina , on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern-day North Carolina , South Carolina , and Georgia . Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its territorial integrity was being threatened . He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area . Claiborne , still intent on his own project , received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631 , one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect . Claiborne sailed for Kent Island on 28 May 1631 with indentured servants recruited in London and money for his trading post , likely believing Calvert 's hopes defeated . He was able to gain the support of the Virginia Council for his project and , as a reward for London merchant Maurice Thomson 's financial support , helped Thomson and two associates get a contract from Virginia guaranteeing a monopoly on tobacco . Claiborne 's Kent Island settlers established a small plantation on the island and appointed a clergyman . While the settlement on Kent Island was progressing , the Privy Council had proposed to Sir George Calvert , former Secretary of State for the King that he be granted a charter for lands north of the Virginia colony , in replacement for the unsuccessful settlements of his earlier colony of Avalon in Newfoundland ( eastern modern Canada ) , in order to create pressure on the Dutch settlements further north along the Delaware and Hudson Rivers ( modern states of Delaware , New Jersey and New York ) . Calvert accepted , though he died in 1632 before the charter could be formally signed by King Charles I , and the Royal Grant and Charter for the new colony of Maryland was instead granted to his son , Cecilius Calvert , on 20 June 1632 . This turn of events was unfortunate for Claiborne , since the Maryland charter included all lands on either side of the Chesapeake Bay north of the mouth of the Potomac River , a region which included Claiborne 's proposed trading post on Kent Island , mid-way on the Bay . The Virginia Assembly , still in support of Claiborne and now including representatives of the Kent Island settlers , issued a series of proclamations and protests both before and after when the news of the granting of the Maryland charter reached across the ocean , claiming the lands for Virginia and protesting the charter 's legality . Claiborne 's first appeal to royal authority in the dispute , which complained both that the lands in the Maryland charter were not really unsettled , as the charter claimed , and that the charter gave so much power to Calvert that it undermined the rights of the settlers , was rejected by the Lords of Foreign Plantations in July 1633 . The following year , the main body of Calvert 's settlers arrived in the Chesapeake and established a permanent settlement on Yaocomico lands at St. Mary 's City . With the support of the Virginia establishment , Claiborne made clear to Calvert that his allegiance was to Virginia and royal authority , and not to the proprietary authority in Maryland . Some historical reports claim that Claiborne tried to incite the natives against the Maryland colonists by telling them that the settlers at St. Mary 's were actually Spanish and enemies of the English , although this claim has never been proven . In 1635 , a Maryland commissioner named Thomas Cornwallis swept the Chesapeake for illegal traders and captured one of Claiborne 's pinnaces in the Pocomoke Sound . Claiborne tried to recover it by force , but was defeated ; although he retained his settlement on Kent Island . These were the first naval battles in North American waters , on 23 April and 10 May 1635 ; three Virginians were killed . During these events , Governor John Harvey of Virginia , who had never been well liked by the Virginian colonists , had followed royal orders to support the Maryland settlement and , just before the naval battles in the Chesapeake , removed Claiborne from office as Secretary of State . In response , Claiborne 's supporters in the Virginia Assembly expelled Harvey from the colony . Two years later , an attorney for Cloberry and Company , who were concerned that the revenues they were receiving from fur trading had not recouped their original investment , arrived on Kent Island . The attorney took possession of the island and bade Claiborne return to England , where Cloberry and Company filed suit against him . The attorney then invited Maryland to take over the island by force , which it did in December 1637 . By March 1638 the Maryland Assembly had declared that all of Claiborne 's property within the colony now belonged to the proprietor . Maryland temporarily won the legal battle for Kent Island and won again when Claiborne 's final appeal was rejected by the Privy Council in April 1638 . = = Parliamentary Commissioner and the second dispute with Maryland = = In May 1638 , fresh from his defeat over Kent Island , Claiborne received a commission from the Providence Land Company , who were advised by his old friend Maurice Thomson , to create a new colony on Ruatan Island off the coast of Honduras in the Caribbean Sea . At the time , Honduras itself was a part of Spain 's Kingdom of Guatemala , and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America . Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island , but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642 . Soon after , the chaos of the English Civil War gave Claiborne another opportunity to reclaim Kent Island . The Calverts , who had received such constant support from the King , in turn supported the monarchy during the early stages of the parliamentary crisis . Claiborne found a new ally in Richard Ingle , a pro-Parliament Puritan merchant whose ships had been seized by the Catholic authorities in Maryland in response to a royal decree against Parliament . Claiborne and Ingle saw an opportunity for revenge using the Parliamentary dispute as political cover , and in 1644 Claiborne seized Kent Island while Ingle took over St. Mary 's . Both used religion as a tool to gain popular support , arguing that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted . By 1646 , however , Governor Leonard Calvert had retaken both St. Mary 's and Kent Island with support from Governor Berkeley of Virginia , and , after Leonard Calvert died in 1648 , Cecil Calvert appointed a pro-Parliament Protestant to take over as governor . The rebellion and its religious overtones was one of the factors that led to passage of the landmark Maryland Toleration Act of 1649 , which declared religious tolerance for Catholics and Protestants in Maryland . In 1648 a group of merchants in London applied to Parliament for revocation of the Maryland charter from the Calverts . This was rejected , but Claiborne received a final opportunity to reclaim Kent Island when he was appointed by the Puritan-controlled Parliament to a commission which was charged with suppressing Anglican disquiet in Virginia ; Virginia in this case defined as \" all the plantations in the Bay of the Chesapeake . \" Claiborne and fellow commissioner Richard Bennett secured the peaceful submission of Virginia to Parliamentary rule , and the new Virginia Assembly appointed Claiborne as Secretary of the colony . It also proposed to Parliament new acts which would give Virginia more autonomy from England , which would benefit Claiborne as he pressed his claims on Kent Island . He and Bennett then turned their attention to Maryland and , arguing again that the Catholic Calverts could not be trusted and that the charter gave the Calverts too much power , demanded that the colony submit to the Commonwealth . Governor Stone briefly refused but gave in to Claiborne and the Commission , and submitted Maryland to Parliamentary rule . Claiborne made no overt legal attempts to re-assert control over Kent Island during the commission 's rule of Maryland , although a treaty concluded during that time with the Susquehannocks claimed that Claiborne owned both Kent and Palmer Islands . Claiborne 's legal designs on Maryland were once again defeated when Oliver Cromwell returned Calvert to power in 1653 , after the Rump Parliament ended . In 1654 , Governor Stone of Maryland tried to reclaim authority for the proprietor and declared that Claiborne 's property and his life could be taken at the Governor 's pleasure . Stone 's declaration was ignored and Claiborne and Bennett again overthrew him , creating a new assembly in which Catholics were not allowed to serve . Calvert , now angry at Stone for what he perceived as weakness , demanded that Stone do something , and in 1655 Stone reclaimed control in St. Mary 's and led a group of soldiers to Providence ( modern Annapolis ) . Stone was captured and his force defeated by local Puritan settlers , who took control of the colony . Given the new situation , Claiborne and Bennett went to England in hopes of convincing Cromwell to change his mind but , to their dismay , no decision was made and , lacking royal authority , the Puritans gave power over to a new governor appointed by Calvert . Going behind Claiborne 's back , Bennett and another commissioner reached an agreement with Calvert that virtually guaranteed his continued control over Maryland through the remainder of the Protectorate . With no authority left in Maryland , Claiborne turned to his political offices in Virginia . However , he was a Puritan and an ally of Parliament during the English Civil War , and upon the restoration of the British monarchy in 1660 , he had few friends left in government . Claiborne therefore retired from political affairs in 1660 and spent the remainder of his life managing his 5,000 acre ( 2,023 hectare ) estate , \" Romancoke \" , near West Point on the Pamunkey River , dying there in about 1677 . = = Family life and descendants = = In the midst of the political turmoil of the conflict over Kent Island , Claiborne married Elizabeth Butler of Essex , who would remain his wife at least through 1668 . Claiborne was also the forebear of a number of lines of American Claibornes , and among his descendants are William C. C. Claiborne , first governor of Louisiana , fashion designer Liz Claiborne , Daniel Sullivan ( LtCol USMC ) , the late minister Jerry Falwell , and a number of political figures from Tennessee and Virginia . Descendants of the Claiborne family have formed a society to advance the genealogical study of Claiborne 's lineage . Also some descendants of Claiborne are the families of Wood , Rice , McFarland , Harris , Gooch , Church and Estes .",

His uncompromising policies and harsh tactics in Massachusetts angered the colonists and were instrumental in the building of broad-based opposition within the province to the rule of Parliament in the events leading to the American Revolution . Appointed governor of New Jersey in 1758 , he oversaw the province 's participation in the later years of the French and Indian War , and had a generally positive relationship with its legislature . In 1760 he was given the governorship of Massachusetts , where he had a stormy relationship with the assembly . Early actions turned the colony 's populists against him , and his responses to protests against Parliament 's attempts to tax the colonies deepened divisions . After protests against the Townshend Acts in 1768 , Bernard sought British Army troops be stationed in Boston to overawe the colonists . He was recalled after the publication of letters in which he was critical of the colony . After returning to England , he continued to advise the British government on colonial matters , calling for hardline responses to ongoing difficulties in Massachusetts that culminated in the 1773 Boston Tea Party . He suffered a stroke in 1771 and died in 1779 , leaving a large family . = = Early life = = Francis was born in Brightwell-cum-Sotwell , ( then in Berkshire , but part of Oxfordshire since 1974 ) , England to the Rev. Francis and Margery ( Winslowe ) Bernard and was christened on 12 July 1712 . His father died three years later . His mother remarried , but died herself of smallpox in 1718 . He was thereafter probably raised by an aunt for several years , since his stepfather was forced by a failed courtship to flee to Holland . His stepfather , Anthony Alsop , returned to Berkshire a few years later , and continued to play a role in the boy 's upbringing . Bernard 's formal education began at Westminster in 1725 , and he then spent seven years at Oxford , where Christ Church granted him a master of arts in 1736 . He read law at the Middle Temple and was called to the bar in 1737 , after only four years ( instead of the typical seven ) of study . He settled in Lincoln , where he practiced law and took on a variety of municipal posts . Among his neighbors in Lincoln were the Pownalls , who had one son ( John ) serving in the Colonial Office , and another , Thomas , who went to the North American colonies in 1753 and was appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1757 . Bernard married Amelia Offley , daughter of the sheriff of Derbyshire , in December 1741 , and the couple raised a large family : by 1757 the couple had eight living children . Because his prospects for further income to support this large family were unlikely in Lincoln , he apparently decided to seek a posting in the colonies . John Adams later described Bernard as \" avaricious to a most infamous degree ; needy at the same time , having a numerous family to provide for . \" = = Governor of New Jersey = = Bernard 's wife was cousin to Lord Barrington , who became a Privy Councillor in 1755 . Probably through his connections to Barrington and the Pownalls , he secured an appointment as governor of the Province of New Jersey on 27 January 1758 , a post that became available upon the death of Jonathan Belcher . Leaving some of his children with relatives , the couple sailed for North America with four of their children , arriving at Perth Amboy on 14 June . The colonies were in the middle of the French and Indian War at the time of Bernard 's arrival . He established a good working relationship with New Jersey 's assembly , and was able to convince the province to raise troops and funds for the ongoing war effort . He signed the Treaty of Easton , an agreement between New Jersey and Pennsylvania on one side , and a group of Indian tribes ( the Lenape being of principal concern to New Jersey ) fixing boundaries between colonial and Indian lands . This effort was important , for it reduced raiding on the frontiers and made possible the reallocation of provincial military strength to the war with New France . It and other agreements negotiated by Bernard extinguished all of the remaining Indian titles to New Jersey . Negotiations with the Lenape also resulted in the establishment of the first formal Indian reservation , Brotherton , near present-day Indian Mills . This reservation was only sparsely populated , and was abandoned in 1801 when its remaining inhabitants joined the Stockbridge Indians in upstate New York . = = Governor of Massachusetts = = Through the influence of his connections in the Colonial Office , Bernard was appointed governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in late 1759 . Delays in communications and slow travel were such that Bernard did not arrive in Boston until 2 August 1760 . Although initially warmly welcomed , his tenure in Massachusetts was difficult . Bernard sought to vigorously enforce the Navigation Acts , in part because crown officials ( including the governor and the customs officials ) received shares of the proceeds from the seizure of ships that were caught violating the acts . The legal actions involving these seizures were heard in a jury-less admiralty court before a Crown-appointed judge , and were extremely unpopular . Bernard also made an early opponent of James Otis , Jr. by appointing Lieutenant Governor Thomas Hutchinson to be chief justice of the province 's highest court , a post that had been promised by several previous governors to Otis ' father . Upset over the snub the younger Otis resigned his post as advocate general ( i.e. the Crown 's representative , equivalent to a government prosecutor ) before the admiralty court , and devoted himself instead to arguing ( sometimes pro bono ) on behalf of the merchants in defense of their ships . These early actions during Bernard 's tenure drew a clear dividing line between the \" popular party \" ( exemplified by the Otises ) opposed to British colonial policy and the \" court party \" ( exemplified by Hutchinson ) who supported it . Bernard 's difficulties were compounded when , after the death in late 1760 of King George II , it became necessary to reissue writs of assistance to customs tax collectors . These writs , which were essentially open-ended search warrants , were judicially controversial and so unpopular that their issuance was later explicitly disallowed by the United States Constitution . Hutchinson , who approved the writs in one of his first acts as chief justice , saw his popularity fall , and Otis , who argued the writs violated the Rights of Englishmen , gained in popularity . He was elected to the provincial legislature in May 1761 , where he was well placed to continue his attacks on Bernard 's policies . In the 1761 session of the assembly Otis engineered the gift of Mount Desert Island to Bernard , a partially successful stratagem to divert Bernard 's attention from ongoing customs seizures . Bernard 's unpopularity continued through other tax measures , including the Sugar Act ( 1763 ) and the Stamp Act ( 1765 ) . While the passage of both acts occasioned protest , the response to the Stamp Act included rioting in the streets , and united many factions in the province against the governor . In 1767 the passage by Parliament of the Townshend Acts again raised a storm of protest in the colonies . In Massachusetts the provincial assembly issued a circular letter , calling on the other colonies to join it in a boycott of the goods subject to the Townshend taxes . Bernard was ordered in April 1768 by Lord Hillsborough , who had recently been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary , to dissolve the assembly if it failed to retract the letter . The assembly refused , and Bernard prorogued it in July . Maier says that his letters to London greatly influenced officials there , but they \" distorted \" reality . \" His misguided conviction that the ' faction ' had espoused violence as its primary method of opposition , for example , kept him from recognizing the radicals ' peace-keeping efforts .... Equally dangerous , Bernard 's elaborate accounts were sometimes built on insubstantial evidence . \" Warden argues that Bernard was careful not to explicitly ask London for troops , but his exaggerated accounts strongly suggested they were needed . In the fall of 1767 he warned about a possible insurrection in Boston any day , and his exaggerated report of one disturbance in 1768 , \" certainly had given Lord Hillsboro the impression that troops were the only way to enforce obedience in the town . \" Warden notes that other key British officials in Boston wrote London with the \" same strain of hysteria . \" Four thousand British Army troops arrived in Boston in October 1768 , further heightening tensions . Bernard was vilified in the local press , and accused of writing letters to the ministry that mischaracterized the situation . Although he was challenged to release those letters he refused . Opposition agents in London were eventually able to acquire some of his letters , which reached members of the Sons of Liberty in April 1769 . They were promptly published by the radical Boston Gazette , along with deliberations of the governor 's council . One letter in particular , in which Bernard called for changes to the Massachusetts charter to increase the governor 's power by increasing the council 's dependence on him , was the subject of particularly harsh treatment , and prompted the assembly to formally request that \" he might be forever removed from the Government of the Province . \" He was recalled to England , and Lieutenant Governor Hutchinson became acting governor . When Bernard left Boston on 1 August , the town held an impromptu celebration , decorated the Liberty Tree , and rang church bells . His accomplishments in Massachusetts included the design of Harvard Hall at Harvard University and the construction of a summer estate on Pond Street in Jamaica Plain . = = Return to England = = Upon his return to England , he asked for and received a hearing concerning the colonial petition against his rule . The Privy Council in February 1770 considered the petition , and after deliberation dismissed all of the charges as \" groundless , vexatious , and scandalous . \" Despite this vindication , Bernard resigned as governor in 1771 . He was confirmed in the ownership of Mount Desert Island , a recognition he had been seeking since it was awarded to him in 1761 . Although he had been promised a baronetcy and a pension of \u00a3 1,000 for his service , he learned after his return that the pension had been reduced to \u00a3 500 ( the baronetcy , of Nettleham , was awarded at crown expense ) . His appeals on the matter were at first rejected , but when Lord North became Prime Minister in 1770 , the pension was raised , but shortly after replaced by an appointment as commissioner on the Board of Revenue for Ireland , which paid the same amount . Bernard became an advisor to the North administration on matters concerning the colonies . He generally took a harder line than his predecessor Thomas Pownall , who advocated for colonial interests in Parliament . Proposals he made in 1771 included ideas central to the 1774 Massachusetts Government Act , which severely constrained colonial political power , including a council appointed by the governor rather than one elected by the assembly . Bernard may also have played a role in the difficulties Benjamin Franklin had in being recognized as a colonial agent ; after Franklin 's credentials were refused by the colonial secretary , he encountered Bernard in an antechamber . Biographer Colin Nicolson observes that Bernard 's presence as an advisor to the ministry \" cast a shadow over virtually ever American measure regarding Massachusetts \" that the ministry considered , because of Bernard 's role in breaking trust between the colonists and the London government and the subsequent radicalization of Massachusetts politics . In 1774 , when the North government was considering how to respond to the Boston Tea Party , Bernard published Select Letters on Trade and Government , containing proposals on how to deal with the ongoing difficulties in the colonies . He proposed to reconcile the constitutional grievances of the British and radical Americans by the possible introduction of American representatives into the Parliament of Great Britain . In the Select Letters , which included the essay Principles of Law and Polity which he drafted in 1764 , he laid out a point-by-point exposition of his viewpoints concerning imperial governance . Some of his ideas were enacted , notably those enshrined in the Massachusetts Government Act ; the outrage in London even sparked the sympathetic colonial advocate Thomas Pownall to propose the closure of Boston 's port , which was enacted in the Boston Port Act . = = Decline and death = = In late 1771 Bernard was bequeathed the manor at Nether Winchendon upon the death of a cousin to whom he had been close since childhood . Combined with other uncertainties about where various family members would reside after he received the Irish appointment , the stress of the situation led Bernard to suffer a stroke . His mobility was impaired , but he took the waters at Bath , which appear to have helped his recovery . He applied for permission to resign the Irish post , and settled first at the Nether Winchendon manor ; in 1774 his resignation was accepted and his pension restored . He was well enough in 1772 to travel to Oxford , where he received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law from his alma mater , Christ Church . Because of his health he moved later in 1772 to a smaller house in nearby Aylesbury . He died on 16 June 1779 , after an epileptic seizure , at Nether Winchendon . = = Legacy = = Bernard never believed the difficulties he had in Massachusetts were personal : instead of accepting some responsibility , he blamed his problems on the policies emanating from London that he was instructed to implement . John Adams wrote that Bernard 's \" antagonistic reports \" of matters in Massachusetts were instrumental in turning British government policymakers against colonial interests . Bernard 's name headed a list drawn up in Massachusetts after the American Revolutionary War broke out of \" notorious conspirators against the government \" , and most of his property there was confiscated . Mount Desert Island was not entirely taken ; Bernard 's son John , who resided in Maine during the war and sided with the victorious Americans , was able to receive Massachusetts title to half of the island . Upon the election of James Bowdoin to be Governor of Massachusetts in 1786 , Reverend William Gordon in his sermon warned Bowdoin that he ignored the state 's legislature at his peril , as Bernard had . Vealtown , New Jersey , a town first settled around 1715 and located in Bernards Township , was renamed Bernardsville in Bernard 's honour in 1840 . Bernardston , Massachusetts was incorporated during his Massachusetts administration and is named for him . Bernard also named Berkshire County , Massachusetts ( after his county of birth ) and Pittsfield , Massachusetts ( after British Prime Minister William Pitt ) .",

The mutiny , and the refusal of the Executive Council of Pennsylvania to stop it , ultimately resulted in Congress vacating Philadelphia and the creation of a federal district to serve as the national capital . = = Background = = From March 1781 , the Congress of the Confederation and the Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania were situated at the Pennsylvania State House ( now known as Independence Hall ) in Philadelphia . Under the authority of the Articles of Confederation , the national government did not have direct control over the military , except in times of war , and was largely reliant on the use of state militias to enforce laws and keep order . On June 17 , 1783 , Congress received a message from soldiers of the Continental Army stationed in Philadelphia , which demanded payment for their service during the American Revolutionary War . The soldiers threatened to take action that day if their complaints were not addressed . Congress ignored their message , but the soldiers did not act on their threat . Two days later , however , the Congress received word that a group of about 80 soldiers had left their post at Lancaster , Pennsylvania , approximately 60 miles ( 97 km ) west of Philadelphia , and had joined with the soldiers stationed at the city barracks . The group of approximately 500 men had effective control over the weapons stores and munition depot . = = = Protests = = = The next morning on June 20 , the State House was mobbed by as many as 400 soldiers demanding payment . The soldiers blocked the door and initially refused to allow the delegates to leave . Alexander Hamilton , then a delegate from New York , persuaded the soldiers to allow Congress to meet later to address their concerns . The soldiers did allow the members of Congress to peacefully adjourn that afternoon . That evening , a small Congressional committee , headed by Hamilton , met in secret to draft a message to the Pennsylvania Council , asking them to protect Congress from the mutineers . The letter threatened that Congress would be forced to move elsewhere if the Council did not act . On June 21 , the Congressional committee met again at the State House with members of the Pennsylvania Executive Council , including its president , John Dickinson . The members of Congress asked the council to do more to protect the federal government . Dickinson and the council agreed to consult with the militia commanders and reply to Congress the next day . The following morning , the Pennsylvania Council again refused Congress ' request . Lacking sufficient assurances that the state would be willing to protect Congress , the members left Philadelphia that day for Princeton , New Jersey . = = Effect = = There are three reasons put forth as to why Dickinson and the Pennsylvania Council did not act . The Council 's official reasoning was that they were unsure that the local militiamen would actually protect Congress from their fellow soldiers . Further , the council may have thought that the conflict was not as serious as Congress believed and that the mutiny could be resolved peacefully . The second theory put forth is that Dickinson , having been an officer in the militia , was sympathetic to the soldiers ' grievances . The third theory is that the Council refused to allow Pennsylvania , a sovereign state , to be subjugated by the demands of a few members of Congress . After Congress completed its business at Princeton in early November 1783 , the capital was moved later that month to Annapolis , Maryland , then to Trenton , New Jersey in November 1784 , and finally to New York City in January 1785 . It was not until the Constitutional Convention in 1787 that delegates decided to meet again in Philadelphia . Pennsylvania 's failure to protect the institutions of the national government , however , was a primary reason why the framers of the Constitution decided to create a federal district , distinct from the states , where Congress could provide for its own security . The delegates therefore agreed in Article One , Section 8 , of the United States Constitution to give the Congress the power \" to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever , over such District ( not exceeding ten miles square ) as may , by cession of particular states , and the acceptance of Congress , become the seat of the government of the United States \" . Following the ratification of the United States Constitution by the state of New York in 1788 , the delegates agreed to keep New York City as the temporary federal capital . In 1790 , Congress passed the Residence Act , which created the District of Columbia , located on the banks of the Potomac River from land belonging until that time to the states of Maryland and Virginia , to serve as the new federal capital . Robert Morris , a representative from Pennsylvania , convinced Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built . As a result , the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of 10 years . In a final attempt to convince Congress to keep the capital in Philadelphia , the city began construction on a new Presidential palace and an expansion to Congress Hall . However , their efforts failed , and the national government relocated from Philadelphia for the final time on May 14 , 1800 .",

The title Colonel , however , was honorary . He was the first president of the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railway , as well as one of the railroad 's directors for nearly 40 years , up to 1900 . A number of railway locomotives have been named after him . = = Education and early career = = He was born on April 3 , 1826 , to David and Mary ( Kennedy ) Holliday , in Kidderminster , Pennsylvania ( near Carlisle ) . The younger Holliday received a public school education , graduating from Allegheny College in Meadville , Pennsylvania , where he studied law , in 1852 . Although he moved to Kansas in 1854 , Allegheny College 's alumni records show Holliday receiving a master 's degree in 1855 . While he was still in Meadville , he was asked to prepare legal documentation for a new railroad that would connect to the city . The proposed railroad ( likely the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad which was sometimes known as \" The Meadville Line \" ) would almost connect with a larger nearby system ( the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad ) , which meant that it could become a feeder route to the larger railroad . Holliday saw the potential of the line and instead of asking for a standard fee to create the documents , he asked for and was granted a partnership in the new railroad . When this railroad was purchased by the larger system , Holliday earned $ 20,000 from the sale . After the sale was completed , he married Mary Dillon Jones . He soon followed the many others making the migration to settle land west of the Mississippi River , but Mary stayed behind in Pennsylvania . The two were reunited later in Kansas after the births of their children , Lillie and Charles King . = = Founding Topeka and military service = = In 1854 he moved to Kansas , leaving his wife behind in Pennsylvania to follow later . He first settled in Lawrence in October 1854 . On December 10 , 1854 , after helping to find a location for the new townsite of Topeka , he wrote a letter to his wife saying : \" I am now thirty miles above Lawrence on the Kansas River assisting in starting a new town . We are just about in the central portion of the \" settled \" Territory and with perhaps the best landing and the most eligible site for a city in the entire country . ... So I think it must be , and in a few years when civilization by its magic influence shall have transformed this glorious country from what it is now to the brilliant destiny awaiting it , the Sun in all his course will visit no land more truly lovely and desirable than this . Here , Mary , with God 's kind permission , we will make our home ; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be . \" In 1855 Holliday received the honorary title of Colonel for supervising a regiment during the Wakarusa War . He also served as the Adjutant General of Kansas during the Civil War from May 2 , 1864 to March 31 , 1865 . Although his Colonel title was only honorary , he continued to use it long after his military service . In 1861 , Holliday served in the Kansas State Senate , and although he ran for Congress in 1874 , he was defeated in that election . He was a Republican . Holliday had broad interests in developing the natural resources of Kansas . In the 1890s he became mistakenly convinced that Ellis and Trego counties in central Kansas contained mineral deposits of tin , zinc , and gold . In 1899 his son Charles K. Holliday founded Smoky Hill City , Kansas near the supposed mineral deposits . = = The Santa Fe Railroad = = Once Topeka was founded , it needed transportation to connect it to the rest of the country . Holliday 's legal skills were called on again to create the paperwork for a new railroad . In 1859 he singlehandedly wrote the charter for the Atchison and Topeka Railroad Company , which would connect the two cities by rail following the route of the Santa Fe Trail . Kansas Territory governor Samuel Medary approved the charter on February 11 , 1859 . Holliday was named a director and president of the new railroad on September 17 , 1860 , which was renamed in 1863 to the Atchison , Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad . During his tenure as president , Holliday secured land grants from the federal government that would soon be used by the railroad to populate the western portion of Kansas in order to build a customer base for the railroad . He stepped down from the presidency at the end of 1863 , but remained on the board of directors until July 27 , 1865 . He rejoined the board on September 24 , 1868 , this time serving until his death on March 29 , 1900 . = = Legacy = = Holliday is buried in Topeka Cemetery , Topeka , Kansas .

He was elected in 1863 and guided the state through the latter part of the Civil War and the beginning of Reconstruction . At the outbreak of the war , Bramlette put his promising political career on hold and enlisted in the Union Army , raising and commanding the 3rd Kentucky Infantry . In 1862 , President Abraham Lincoln appointed him district attorney for Kentucky . A year later , he was the Union Democrats ' nominee for governor . Election interference by the Union Army gave him a landslide victory over his opponent , Charles A. Wickliffe . Within a year , however , federal policies such as recruiting Kentucky Negroes for the Union Army and suspending the writ of habeas corpus for Kentucky citizens caused Bramlette to abandon his support of the Lincoln administration and declare that he would \" bloodily baptize the state into the Confederacy \" . After the war , Bramlette issued a general pardon for most ex-Confederates in the state . He opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and the establishment of the Freedmen 's Bureau in Kentucky . Among his accomplishments not related to the war and its aftermath were the reduction of the state 's debt and the establishment of the Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College ( now the University of Kentucky ) . Following his term as governor , Bramlette returned to his legal practice in Louisville . He died January 12 , 1875 and was buried in Cave Hill Cemetery . = = Early life = = Thomas E. Bramlette was born on January 3 , 1817 , at Elliott 's Cross Roads in Cumberland ( now Clinton ) County , Kentucky . He was the son of Colonel Ambrose S. and Sarah ( Elliott ) Bramlette . His father served two terms in the Kentucky Senate and several terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives . Bramlette studied law , was admitted to the bar in 1837 at the age of 20 , and began practicing in Louisville , Kentucky . In September of that year , Bramlette married Sallie Travis , the first of his two wives . The couple had two children , Thomas and Corinne . Bramlette 's political career began in 1841 , when he was elected to represent Clinton County in the General Assembly . In 1848 , Governor John J. Crittenden appointed Bramlette Commonwealth 's Attorney . He resigned the position in 1850 to continue his legal practice , relocating to Columbia , Kentucky in 1852 . He was the Whig nominee for his district 's seat in the House of Representatives in 1853 , but was defeated by Democrat James Chrisman . In 1856 , he was elected as a judge in Kentucky 's 6th Judicial District , serving with distinction for five years . = = Military service = = Bramlette resigned his judgeship and accepted a commission as a colonel in the Union Army on August 7 , 1861 . In violation of Kentucky 's agreement to remain neutral in the Civil War , he raised and commanded the 3rd Kentucky Infantry . On September 19 , the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to forestall a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state 's junior Senator , John C. Breckinridge . A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made , and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter . Bramlette resigned his military commission on July 13 , 1862 at Decherd , Tennessee . He returned to Louisville to accept President Abraham Lincoln 's offer to become United States District Attorney for Kentucky . During his tenure in this position , he vigorously enforced Kentucky 's wartime laws against Confederates and Confederate sympathizers . = = Governor of Kentucky = = Union Democrats chose Joshua Fry Bell as their candidate for governor of Kentucky in 1863 , but Bell was skeptical of Kentucky 's future with the Union and withdrew his name from consideration . The party 's central committee chose Bramlette to replace Bell , and Bramlette declined a commission as a brigadier general in the Union Army to make the race . During the election , Union forces intimidated and jailed supporters of Bramlette 's opponent , former governor Charles A. Wickliffe . As a result , Bramlette carried the election by a margin of nearly 4-to-1 . During his term , he turned down an offered seat in the U.S. House of Representatives as well as a nomination to become the Democratic candidate for Vice-President in 1864 . = = = Civil War = = = In December 1863 , Bramlette addressed the General Assembly , declaring that the state had fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army . January 4 of the following year , he proclaimed that rebel sympathizers would be held responsible for all guerrilla raids in the state , and specified stiff fines and imprisonment for anyone found to be aiding the guerrillas . Although Bramlette assumed the governorship as a staunch supporter of the Union cause , within a year he issued a proclamation that he would \" bloodily baptize the state into the Confederacy \" . The reasons for Bramlette 's reversal were many . He took issue with General Stephen Burbridge 's decision to enlist Negroes from Kentucky for military service , asking that this measure only be taken if Kentucky failed to meet her quota . The situation worsened when on July 5 , 1864 , President Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus for citizens of the Commonwealth . Burbridge continually menaced Kentucky 's citizens , interfering with the presidential election of 1864 , and banishing Lieutenant Governor Richard T. Jacob from the state . When the General Assembly re-convened in January 1865 , Bramlette continued to voice his opposition to the Union 's tactics . Nevertheless , he urged passage of the Thirteenth Amendment , maintaining that the institution of slavery was \" irrevocably doomed \" . = = = Reconstruction era = = = Despite his disagreements with the Lincoln administration , Bramlette proclaimed a day of fasting and prayer upon receiving news of Lincoln 's assassination . The General Assembly petitioned new president Andrew Johnson to call an end to martial law in the state . The tension between the state and federal governments remained , however . Bramlette announced that every \" white male citizen \" twenty-one years of age who had resided in the Commonwealth for at least two years would be eligible to vote . Spurred on by the Democratic governor 's actions , Kentucky gave control of both houses of the General Assembly and five of its nine congressional seats to Democrats . President Johnson received the message , ending martial law and restoring habeas corpus in Kentucky . When the General Assembly convened in December 1865 , Bramlette sought to restore harmony in the state by issuing pardons to most ex-Confederates . He and the majority of the General Assembly opposed passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments , and Bramlette protested the establishment of the Freedmen 's Bureau in the Commonwealth . Bramlette was very proud of those of his accomplishments not related to the Civil War , including the reduction of the state 's debt and the establishment of the Agricultural and Mechanical College ( later , the University of Kentucky ) . He supported the construction of turnpikes financed by government bonds , the development of natural resources , and encouraged immigration to obtain adequate labor to support reconstruction efforts . = = Later life and death = = Following his term as governor , Bramlette conducted a failed campaign to become a U.S. Senator . He married Mary E. Graham Adams in 1874 , two years after the death of his first wife . He returned to his law practice in Louisville , and became a patron of many charitable organizations . Bramlette died in Louisville on January 12 , 1875 following a brief illness . He is buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville .",

                    "text": "Shays ' Rebellion = Shays ' Rebellion was an armed uprising in Massachusetts ( mostly in and around Springfield ) during 1786 and 1787 . Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led four thousand rebels ( called Shaysites ) in rising up against perceived economic injustices and suspension of civil rights ( including multiple eviction and foreclosure notices ) by Massachusetts , and in a later attempt to capture the United States ' national weapons arsenal at the U.S. Armory at Springfield . Although Shays ' Rebellion met with defeat militarily against a privately raised militia , it prompted numerous national leaders ( including George Washington , who came out of retirement to deal with issues raised by Shays ' Rebellion ) to call for a stronger national government to suppress future rebellions , resulting in the U.S. Constitutional Convention and according to historian Leonard L. Richards , \" fundamentally altering the course of U.S. history . \" The rebellion took place in a political climate where reform of the country 's governing document , the Articles of Confederation , was widely seen as necessary . The events of the rebellion , some of which occurred after the Philadelphia Convention had been called but before it began in May 1787 , are widely seen to have affected the debates on the shape of the new government . The shock of Shays ' Rebellion drew retired General George Washington back into public life , leading to his terms as the United States ' first President . The exact nature and consequence of the rebellion 's influence on the content of the Constitution and the ratification debates continues to be a subject of historical discussion and debate . = = Background = = In the rural parts of New England , particularly in the hill-towns of central and western Massachusetts , the economy during the American Revolutionary War had been one of little more than subsistence agriculture . Some residents in these areas had little in the way of assets beyond their land , and bartered with one another for goods or services . In lean times , farmers might obtain goods on credit from suppliers in local market towns who would be paid when times were better . In the more economically developed coastal areas of Massachusetts Bay and in the fertile Connecticut River Valley , the economy was basically a market economy , driven by the activities of wholesale merchants dealing with Europe , the West Indies and elsewhere on the North American coast . Not surprisingly , the state government was dominated by this merchant class . When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783 , the European business partners of Massachusetts merchants refused to extend lines of credit to them and insisted that they pay for goods with hard currency . Despite the continent-wide shortage of such currency , merchants began to demand the same from their local business partners , including those merchants operating in the market towns in the state 's interior . Many of these merchants passed on this demand to their customers , although the popular governor , John Hancock , did not impose hard currency demands on poorer borrowers and refused to actively prosecute the collection of delinquent taxes . The rural farming population was generally unable to meet the demands being made of them by merchants or the civil authorities , and individuals began to lose their land and other possessions when they were unable to fulfill their debt and tax obligations . This led to strong resentments against tax collectors and the courts , where creditors obtained and enforced judgments against debtors , and where tax collectors obtained judgments authorizing property seizures . At a meeting convened by aggrieved commoners , a farmer identified as \" Plough Jogger \" , encapsulated the situation : \" I have been greatly abused , have been obliged to do more than my part in the war , been loaded with class rates , town rates , province rates , Continental rates and all rates ... been pulled and hauled by sheriffs , constables and collectors , and had my cattle sold for less than they were worth ... The great men are going to get all we have and I think it is time for us to rise and put a stop to it , and have no more courts , nor sheriffs , nor collectors nor lawyers . \" Overlaid upon these financial issues was the fact that veterans of the war had received little pay during the war and faced difficulty collecting pay owed them from the State or the Congress of the Confederation . Some of the soldiers , Daniel Shays among them , began to organize protests against these oppressive economic conditions . Shays was a farmhand from Massachusetts when the Revolution broke out ; he joined the Continental Army , saw action at the Battles of Lexington and Concord , Bunker Hill and Saratoga , and was eventually wounded in action . In 1780 , he resigned from the army unpaid and went home to find himself in court for nonpayment of debts . He soon realized that he was not alone in his inability to pay his debts and began organizing for debt relief . = = Early rumblings = = One early protest against the government was led by Job Shattuck of Groton , who in 1782 organized residents there to physically prevent tax collectors from doing their work . A second , larger-scale protest took place in the central Massachusetts town of Uxbridge , in Worcester County , on Feb. 3 , 1783 , when a mob seized property that had been confiscated by a local constable and returned it to its owners . Governor Hancock ordered the sheriff to suppress these actions . Most rural communities , however , attempted to use the legislative process to gain relief . Petitions and proposals were repeatedly submitted to the state legislature to issue paper currency . Such inflationary issues would depreciate the currency , making it possible to meet obligations made at high values with lower-valued paper . The merchants , among them James Bowdoin , were opposed to the idea , since they were generally lenders who stood to lose from such proposals . As a result , these proposals were repeatedly rejected . Governor Hancock , accused by some of anticipating trouble , resigned citing health reasons in early 1785 . When Bowdoin ( a perennial loser to Hancock in earlier elections ) was elected governor that year , matters became more severe . Bowdoin stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes , and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state 's portion of foreign debt payments . Even comparatively conservative commentators such as John Adams observed that these levies were \" heavier than the People could bear . \" = = Shutting down the courts = = Protests in the rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786 , after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston . On August 29 a well-organized force of protestors formed in Northampton and successfully prevented the county court from sitting . The leaders of this and later forces proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions . They called themselves Regulators , a reference to the Regulator movement of North Carolina that sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s . On September 2 Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation denouncing such mob action , but took no military measures beyond planning militia response to future actions . When the court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5 , the county militia ( composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors ) refused to turn out , much to Bowdoin 's amazement . Governors of the neighboring states where similar protests took place acted decisively , calling out the militia to hunt down the ringleaders after the first such protests . In Rhode Island , matters were resolved without violence because the \" country party \" gained control of the legislature in 1786 and enacted measures forcing its merchant elites to trade debt instruments for devalued currency . The impact of this was not lost on Boston 's merchants , especially Bowdoin , who held more than \u00a3 3,000 in Massachusetts notes . Daniel Shays , who had participated in the Northampton action , began to take a more active role in the uprising in November , though he firmly denied that he was one of its leaders . On September 19 , the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion as \" disorderly , riotous , and seditious persons . \" When the supreme judicial court was next scheduled to meet in Springfield on September 26 , Shays in Hampshire County and Luke Day in what is now Hampden County ( but was then part of Hampshire County ) organized an attempt to shut it down . They were anticipated by William Shepard , the local militia commander , who began gathering government-supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit . By the time the court was ready to open , Shepard had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse . Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number , but chose only to demonstrate , exercising their troops outside Shepard 's lines , rather than attempt to seize the building . The judges first postponed the hearings , and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases . Shepard withdrew his force , which had grown to some 800 men ( to the Regulators ' 1,200 ) , to the federal armory , which was then only rumored to be the target of seizure by the activists . Protests in Great Barrington , Concord , and Taunton were also successful in shutting courts down in those communities in September and October . James Warren wrote to John Adams on October 22 , \" We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War . \" Courts in the larger towns and cities were able to meet , but required protection of the militia , which Bowdoin called out for the purpose . The Boston elites were mortified at this resistance . Governor Bowdoin commanded the legislature to \" vindicate the insulted dignity of government . \" Samuel Adams claimed that foreigners ( \" British emissaries \" ) were instigating treason among the commoners , and he helped draw up a Riot Act , and a resolution suspending habeas corpus in order to permit the authorities to keep people in jail without trial . Adams even proposed a new legal distinction : that rebellion in a republic , unlike in a monarchy , should be punished by execution . The legislature also moved to make some concessions to the upset farmers , saying certain old taxes could now be paid in goods instead of hard currency . These measures were followed up by one prohibiting speech critical of the government , and offering pardons to protestors willing to take an oath of allegiance . These legislative actions were unsuccessful in quelling the protests , and the suspension of habeas corpus alarmed many . In late November warrants were issued for the arrest of several of the protest ringleaders . On November 28 a posse of some 300 men rode to Groton to arrest Job Shattuck and other rebel leaders in the area . Shattuck was chased down and arrested on the 30th , and was wounded by a sword slash in the process . This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state radicalized those in the west , and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government . \" The seeds of war are now sown \" , wrote one correspondent in Shrewsbury , and by mid-January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the \" tyrannical government of Massachusetts . \" = = Rebellion = = Since the federal government had been unable to recruit soldiers for the army ( primarily because of a lack of funding ) , the Massachusetts elites determined to act independently . On January 4 , 1787 , Governor Bowdoin proposed creation of a privately funded militia army . Former Continental Army General Benjamin Lincoln solicited funds , and had by the end of January raised more than \u00a3 6,000 from more than 125 merchants . The 3,000 militia that were recruited into this army were almost entirely from the eastern counties of Massachusetts , and marched to Worcester on January 19 . While the government forces organized , Shays , Day , and other rebel leaders in the west organized their forces , establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically elected committees . Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield . General Shepard had however , pursuant to orders from Governor Bowdoin , taken possession of the armory and used its arsenal to arm a force of some 1,200 militia . He had done this despite the fact that the armory was federal , not state , property , and that he did not have permission from Secretary at War Henry Knox to do so . The insurgents were organized into three major groups , and intended to surround and simultaneously attack the armory . Shays had one group east of Springfield near Palmer , Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield , and the third force , under Eli Parsons , was to the north at Chicopee . The rebels had planned their assault for January 25 , but Luke Day changed this at the last minute , sending Shays a message indicating he would not be ready to attack until the 26th . Day 's message was intercepted by Shepard 's men , so the militia of Shays and Parsons , some 1,500 men , approached the armory on the 25th not knowing they would have no support from the west . When Shays and his forces neared the armory , they found Shepard 's militia waiting for them . Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the approaching Shaysites ' heads , and then ordered two cannons to fire grape shot at Shays ' men . Four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded . There was no musket fire from either side , and the rebel advance collapsed . Most of the rebel force fled north , eventually regrouping at Amherst . On the opposite side of the river , Day 's forces also fled north , also eventually reaching Amherst . General Lincoln , when he heard of the Springfield incident , immediately began marching west from Worcester with the 3,000 men that had mustered . The rebels moved generally north and east to avoid Lincoln , eventually establishing a camp at Petersham ; along the way they raided the shops of local merchants for supplies , taking some of them hostage . Lincoln pursued them , reaching Pelham , some 30 miles ( 48 km ) from Petersham , on February 2 . On the night of February 3 \u2013 4 , he led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm . Arriving early in the morning , they surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that they scattered \" without time to call in their out parties or even their guards . \" Although Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men , none of them were officers , leading historian Leonard Richards to suspect the veracity of the report . Most of the leadership escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont , where they were sheltered despite repeated demands that they be returned to Massachusetts for trial . = = Mopping up = = Lincoln 's march marked the end of large-scale organized resistance . Ringleaders who eluded capture fled to neighboring states , and pockets of local resistance continued . Some rebel leaders approached Lord Dorchester , the British governor of Quebec for assistance , who was reported to promise assistance in the form of Mohawk warriors led by Joseph Brant . ( Dorchester 's proposal was vetoed in London , and no assistance came to the rebels . ) The same day that Lincoln arrived at Petersham , the state legislature passed bills authorizing a state of martial law , giving the governor broad powers to act against the rebels . The bills also authorized state payments to reimburse Lincoln and the merchants who had funded the army , and authorized the recruitment of additional militia . On February 12 the legislature passed the Disqualification Act , seeking to prevent a legislative response by rebel sympathizers . This bill expressly forbade any acknowledged rebels from holding a variety of elected and appointed offices . Most of Lincoln 's army melted away in late February as enlistments expired ; by the end of the month he commanded but thirty men at a base in Pittsfield . In the meantime some 120 rebels had regrouped in New Lebanon , New York , and on February 27 they crossed the border . Marching first on Stockbridge , a major market town in the southwestern corner of the state , they raided the shops of merchants and the homes of merchants and local professionals . This came to the attention of Brigadier John Ashley , who mustered a force of some 80 men , and caught up with the rebels in nearby Sheffield late in the day . In the bloodiest encounter of the rebellion , 30 rebels were wounded ( one mortally ) , at least one government soldier was killed , and many were wounded . Ashley , who was further reinforced after the encounter , reported taking 150 prisoners . = = Consequences = = Four thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion ( in exchange for amnesty ) ; several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion . Most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders . Eighteen men were convicted and sentenced to death , but most of these were either overturned on appeal , pardoned , or had their sentences commuted . Two of the condemned men , John Bly and Charles Rose , were hanged on December 6 , 1787 . Shays himself was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods . He was , however , vilified by the Boston press , who painted him as an archetypal anarchist opposed to the government . He later moved to the Conesus , New York , area , where he lived until he died poor and obscure in 1825 . The crushing of the rebellion and the harsh terms of reconciliation imposed by the Disqualification Act all worked against Governor Bowdoin politically . In the gubernatorial election held in April 1787 , Bowdoin received few votes from the rural parts of the state , and was trounced by John Hancock . The military victory was tempered by tax changes in subsequent years . The legislature elected in 1787 cut taxes and placed a moratorium on debts . It also refocused state spending away from interest payments , resulting in a 30 % decline in the value of Massachusetts securities as those payments fell in arrears . Vermont , then an unrecognized independent republic that had been seeking statehood independent from New York 's claims to the territory , became an unexpected beneficiary of the rebellion due to its sheltering of the rebel ringleaders . Alexander Hamilton broke from other New Yorkers , including major landowners with claims on Vermont territory , calling for the state to recognize and support Vermont 's bid for admission to the union . He cited Vermont 's de facto independence and its ability to cause trouble by providing support to the discontented from neighboring states as reasons , and introduced legislation that broke the impasse between New York and Vermont . Vermonters responded favorably to the overture , publicly pushing Eli Parsons and Luke Day out of the state ( but quietly continuing to support others ) . After negotiations with New York and the passage of the new constitution , Vermont became the fourteenth state . = = Impact on Constitution = = Thomas Jefferson , who was serving as ambassador to France at the time , refused to be alarmed by Shays ' Rebellion . In a letter to James Madison on January 30 , 1787 , he argued that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing . \" The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants . It is its natural manure . \" In contrast to Jefferson 's sentiments George Washington , who had been calling for constitutional reform for many years , wrote in a letter to Henry Lee , \" You talk , my good sir , of employing influence to appease the present tumults in Massachusetts . I know not where that influence is to be found , or , if attainable , that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders . Influence is not government . Let us have a government by which our lives , liberties , and properties will be secured , or let us know the worst at once . \" = = = Influence on Constitutional Convention = = = At the time of the rebellion , the weaknesses of the federal government as constituted under the Articles of Confederation were apparent to many . A vigorous debate was going on throughout the states on the need for a stronger central government , with Federalists arguing for the idea , and Anti-Federalists opposing them . Historical opinion is divided on what sort of role the rebellion played in the formation and later ratification of the United States Constitution , although most scholars agree it played some role , at least temporarily drawing some anti-Federalists to the strong government side . By early 1785 many influential merchants and political leaders were already agreed that a stronger central government was needed . A convention at Annapolis , Maryland , in September 1786 of delegates from five states concluded that vigorous steps needed to be taken to reform the federal government , but it disbanded because of a lack of full representation , calling for a convention of all the states to be held in Philadelphia in May 1787 . Historian Robert Feer notes that several prominent figures had hoped that convention would fail , requiring a larger-scale convention , and French diplomat Louis-Guillaume Otto thought the convention was intentionally broken off early to achieve this end . In early 1787 John Jay wrote that the rural disturbances and the inability of the central government to fund troops in response made \" the inefficiency of the Federal government [ become ] more and more manifest . \" Henry Knox observed that the uprising in Massachusetts clearly influenced local leaders who had previously opposed a strong federal government . Historian David Szatmary writes that the timing of the rebellion \" convinced the elites of sovereign states that the proposed gathering at Philadelphia must take place . \" Some states , Massachusetts among them , delayed choosing delegates to the proposed convention , in part because in some ways it resembled the \" extra-legal \" conventions organized by the protestors before the rebellion became violent . = = = Influence on Constitution = = = The convention that met in Philadelphia was dominated by strong-government advocates . Delegate Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut argued that because the people could not be trusted ( as exemplified by Shays ' Rebellion ) , the members of the federal House of Representatives should be chosen by state legislatures , not by popular vote . The example of Shays ' Rebellion may also have been influential in the addition of language to the constitution concerning the ability of states to manage domestic violence , and their ability to demand the return of individuals from other states for trial . The rebellion also played a role in the discussion of a number of the executives . While mindful of tyranny , delegates of the Constitutional Convention thought that the single executive would be more effective in responding to national disturbances . Federalists cited the rebellion as an example of the confederation government 's weaknesses , while opponents such as Elbridge Gerry thought that a federal response to the rebellion would have been even worse than that of the state . ( Gerry , a merchant speculator and Massachusetts delegate from Essex County , was one of the few convention delegates who refused to sign the new constitution , although his reasons for doing so did not stem from the rebellion . ) = = = Influence on ratification = = = When the constitution had been drafted , Massachusetts was viewed by Federalists as a state that might not ratify it , because of widespread anti-Federalist sentiment in the rural parts of the state . Massachusetts Federalists , including Henry Knox , were active in courting swing votes in the debates leading up to the state 's ratifying convention in 1788 . When the vote was taken on February 6 , 1788 , representatives of rural communities involved in the rebellion voted against ratification by a wide margin , but the day was carried by a coalition of merchants , urban elites , and market town leaders . The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168 . Historians are divided on the impact the rebellion had on the ratification debates . Robert Feer notes that major Federalist pamphleteers rarely mentioned it , and that some anti-Federalists used the fact that Massachusetts survived the rebellion as evidence that a new constitution was unnecessary . However , Leonard Richards counters that publications like the Pennsylvania Gazette explicitly tied anti-Federalist opinion to the rebel cause , calling opponents of the new constitution \" Shaysites \" and the Federalists \" Washingtonians \" . David Szatmary argues that debate in some states was affected , particularly in Massachusetts , where the rebellion had a polarizing effect . Richards records Henry Jackson 's observation that opposition to ratification in Massachusetts was motivated by \" that cursed spirit of insurgency \" , but that broader opposition in other states originated in other constitutional concerns expressed by Elbridge Gerry , who published a widely distributed pamphlet outlining his concerns about the vagueness of some of the powers granted in the constitution and its lack of a Bill of Rights . The military powers enshrined in the constitution were soon put to use by President George Washington . After the passage by the United States Congress of the Whiskey Act , protest against the taxes it imposed began in western Pennsylvania . The protests escalated and Washington led federal and state militia to put down what is now known as the Whiskey Rebellion . = = Memorials = = The events and people of the uprising are commemorated in the towns where they lived and those where events took place . Sheffield erected a memorial ( pictured above ) marking the site of the \" last battle \" , and Pelham memorialized Daniel Shays . US Route 202 , which runs through Pelham , is called the Daniel Shays Highway . A statue of General Shepard was erected in his hometown of Westfield . In the town of Petersham , Massachusetts , a memorial was erected in 1927 by the New England Society of Brooklyn , New York . The memorial commemorates General Benjamin Lincoln , who raised 3,000 troops and routed the rebellion on February 4 , 1787 . It ends with the line , \" Obedience to the law is true liberty . \"",

                    "text": "History of slavery in Indiana = Slavery in Indiana occurred between the time of French rule during late seventeenth century and 1826 , with a few traces of slavery afterward . When the United States first forcibly removed the Native Americans from the region , slavery was accepted as a necessity to keep peace with the Indians and the French . When the Indiana Territory was established in 1800 , William Henry Harrison , a former slaveholder , was appointed governor and slavery continued to be tolerated through a series of laws enacted by the appointed legislature . Opposition against slavery began to organize in Indiana around 1805 , and in 1809 abolitionists took control of the territorial legislature and overturned many of the laws permitting retaining of slaves . By the time Indiana was granted statehood in 1816 , the abolitionists were in firm control and slavery was banned in the constitution . In 1820 , an Supreme Court of Indiana ruling in Polly v. Lasselle freed all the remaining slaves in the state . An additional Supreme Court ruling in 1821 freed indentured servant Mary Bateman Clark , helping to bring an end to indentured servitude . With the end of slavery in the state , Indiana became a border state with the southern slave states . Hoosiers like Levi Coffin came to play an important role in the Underground Railroad that helped many slaves escape from the South . Indiana remained anti-slavery and in the American Civil War remained with the Union and contributed men to the war . = = Early existence = = In 1783 , at the end of the American Revolution , the territory that would become Indiana was annexed to the United States . Slavery was already a present institution \u2013 the French who had controlled the area only 20 years earlier , and their allies among the Native American Population , had been practicing slavery in the region for at least one hundred and fifty years before the Americans took control . Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle , first began explorations in Indiana in the late 1660s . He was accompanied by a Shawnee slave on several of his expeditions . In 1787 Congress organized the territory under the Northwest Ordinance , which prohibited slavery by stating \" that there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory \" . It would later be decided that anyone who purchased a slave outside of the territory could enter and reside there with their slaves . The Ordinance also allowed for preexisting French \u2013 Indian slave arrangements . Many Virginian natives living in the territory interpreted the Ordinance as allowing them to have slaves . The Ordinance stated that the Virginians \" shall have their possessions and titles confirmed to them , and be protected in the enjoyment of their rights and liberties . \" Many decided to keep slaves . Fear of French rebellion kept the courts from acting against slavery , as did the violent actions of those who would kidnap escaped slaves . A court ruling in the Michigan Territory in 1807 stated that preexisting slavery could still exist under the Northwest Ordinance , validated Hoosier slaveholding in the opinions of the slaveholders . = = = Southern influence = = = Many of the territory 's early settlers came from the South . Southern immigrants who were anti-slavery settled in Ohio where a strong anti-slavery movement was underway . The immigrants in favor of slavery generally moved to Indiana where the government was friendly to slaveholders . When they relocated to the Indiana Territory , they brought what few slaves they owned with them . An 1810 census recorded 393 free blacks and 237 slaves in the Indiana Territory . Knox County , where the territorial capital of Indiana , Vincennes , was located , was the center of Indiana slavery . A young Army officer named Charles Larrabee , who was serving in Governor William Henry Harrison \u2019 s army , summed the Vincennes populace as \u201c chiefly from Kentucky and Virginia \u2026 slavery is tolerated here . \u201d Most of the initial immigration was attributed to the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 . After the Revolutionary War , George Rogers Clark and his soldiers , all Virginians , were given land grants in southern Indiana . Many settled in Indiana bringing their Southern ideals with them . After the War of 1812 many veterans of the Western theater were granted land in central Indiana . These soldiers were mostly from Kentucky and the South . They also moved into Indiana , bringing more Southern influence to the state . Southerners of all classes migrated to Indiana . William Henry Harrison , longtime Indiana Territory governor and future United States President , was from the long established aristocracy class of the lowland and coastal South . His class supported slavery . From the non-slaveholding class of the Upland South were migrants such as Abraham Lincoln , whose family is representative of the migration to Indiana from Kentucky and Tennessee . Some of his social class , while not owning slaves , typically condoned the institution . Lincoln 's father worked as a slave catcher and the family of Lincoln 's wife , Mary Todd , owned slaves . But others immigrated to Indiana such as Levi Coffin , a North Carolina Quaker who was an outspoken abolitionist . = = Treatment of slaves = = The first recorded slaves in Indiana were owned by the French traders who entered the region and introduced the practice to the native tribes . Jesuit priests encouraged the tribes they lived among to adopt slavery as an alternative to executing their prisoners in war . According to some classical historians , the decline of cannibalism among the tribes was a direct result of the rise of slavery . Early slaves were often Native Americans who were sold to pay debts . The early slaves typically performed manual labor , helping the traders transport their goods and to build forts and trading posts . While part of new France , laws were enacted to give slaves some protection from their masters . Torture and mutilation of slaves was forbidden , and families were prevented from being forcibly broken up . Other laws allowed slaves to be seized by creditors as payment . Other laws required that if a master had children by a slave , the slave and her children were then to be freed . Their status under the French laws was similar to that of minors . As the territory developed , their tasks changed ; slaves also served as household servants and farm workers , as in the case of William Henry Harrison 's slaves . George Rogers Clark 's two slaves assisted him in running a gristmill in Clarksville . While the pro-slavery faction was in power , laws were passed permitting anyone to seize and return slaves who were more than ten miles from their home , and a one hundred dollar fine was placed on anyone who helped a slave escape . Some slaves , like \" Aunt Fannie \" , who belonged to Dennis Pennington , refused to be set free . Pennington had freed all his slaves when he left Virginia , but Fannie did not want to be left behind and continued on as a free household servant for the rest of her life . She was buried in the Pennington family cemetery in Corydon , Indiana . Others were not so fortunate as in the case of another black woman who also lived in Corydon . When she tried to escape from her masters she was run down in the street , beaten , and carried back home . The men threatened death to anyone in the town , which was strongly anti-slavery , who interfered . The slaves did not have a large impact on Indiana 's economy as they never became a large percentage of the population and large scale plantation style farms , that were common in the southern states , never developed in Indiana . In 1820 , the year all the state 's slaves were freed , the census only counted 192 out of a population over 65,000 . Many slaves had already been freed by that time and there over 1200 free blacks in the state during the same census . = = Indiana Territory = = Slavery in the Indiana Territory was supported by Governors William Henry Harrison and his successor Thomas Posey , who both sought to legalize it in the territory . Both men were appointed by the President of the United States while the office was held by southern slaveholders . Although slavery was not legal under Article 6 of the Northwest Ordinance , Harrison recognized the existing customs of slavery and indenture in the territory , Both men 's slavery positions were resisted by the territory 's population . In a gesture to the residents who lived in the territory before the Northwest Ordinance , Harrison organized a public meeting in 1802 which called for a 10-year moratorium on the slavery ban . Harrison and Posey were strongly opposed by Jonathan Jennings , Dennis Pennington , and other prominent men who would eventually take over the territorial legislature . Indiana courts never ruled on the Ordinance / slavery issue during the territorial period . When the issue of slavery was in the courts , it \u201c was always treated as an existing institution and its legality went unchallenged . \u201d Early Hoosiers , including William Henry Harrison , wanted to have slavery legalized in the new territory . Harrison may have been motivated by the need to appease existing slaveowners , the need for labor in a developing territory , or the desire to attract immigrants from southern colonies . They sought passage of a new law to override the Northwest Ordinance 's ban on slavery . Harrison succeeded in getting permission from Congress for the territory to decide for itself whether slavery should be legalized . Harrison and his party sought to gradually legalize slavery three times ( 1803 , 1807 , and 1809 ) but all three efforts ultimately failed . Harrison succeeded , however , in passing laws that established forms of indentured servitude . Harrison was particularly interested in having slavery legalized . He maintained a plantation style home in Vincennes called Grouseland . Harrison was also in the process of constructing another plantation style farm called Harrison Valley near Corydon in 1807 , the same year he was pushing for slavery to be legalized . In 1803 Harrison asked Congress to suspend the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years . Harrison claimed it was necessary to increase the territory 's population more quickly and attract new settlers . Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially support it . In 1803 the entire territory 's population numbered less than 5,000 . That year the legislature \u2014 which was appointed by Harrison \u2014 passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude . In 1805 the Territory was granted representation in Congress . Pro-slavery Benjamin Parke was elected and supported Harrison 's request to have Congress suspend the ban on slavery in the territory . Parke submitted legislation to outright legalize slavery , but no action was taken on it . The same year , Congress suspended Article Six of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years , and granted the territories covered by it the right to choose for themselves to legalize slavery . By the same act , Congress removed the legislative power from the General Court of the territory and created a Legislative Council that would was to be popularly elected . When the election was complete Davis Floyd was the only anti-slavery member elected ; slavery had not yet become a major issue in the state . That year Harrison persuaded the legislature to begin the debate to legalize slavery . The bill was narrowly defeated because many of the slaveholders in the council wanted a concession from Harrison , namely to recommend creating the Illinois Territory , a concession which he refused to make . = = = Fight to end slavery = = = Harrison 's move to legalize slavery was not taken lightly by President Thomas Jefferson . Although Jefferson was himself a slaveholder , he was opposed to the spread of slavery . Jefferson had been working with James Lemen since at least 1784 and used him as an agent in the Northwest to organize an anti-slavery movement . Lemen succeeded in helping to establish an anti-slavery Baptist church that drew many members . Jefferson sent Lemen to the Indiana territory again in 1807 with the mission to seek out and organize the anti-slavery men of the state and encourage them to take action . Several prominent men had already been stirred by Harrison 's moves to legalize slavery . Dennis Pennington , a former slave holder who had freed his slaves when he moved to Indiana , was chief among the anti-slavery men . Jonathan Jennings , who also attended the meeting , would quickly grow into the party 's leader . Other prominent anti-slavery men included Richard Rue , John Paul , and General William Johnson , all veterans of the Revolution . Later in 1807 , at Lemen 's urging , a mass meeting was held in Springville attended by many of the anti-slavery men within the state . The meeting was held largely in response to Harrison 's attempt to legalize slavery and the fact that he almost succeeded , and likely would soon unless a large anti-slavery faction came to power . The meeting was chaired by John Beggs , with Davis Floyd acting as secretary . Dennis Pennington and others put forth speeches , and resolved to stop the attempt to legalize slavery . They declared their intentions to end the \" despised institution \" . Their resolution stated : ... a great number of citizens , in various parts of the United States , are preparing , and many have actually emigrated to this Territory , to get free from a Government which does tolerate slavery ... And although it is contended by some , that , at this day , there is a great majority in favor of slavery , whilst the opposite opinion is held by others , the fact is certainly doubtful . But when we take into consideration the vast emigration into this Territory , and of citizens , too , decidedly opposed to the measure , we feel satisfied that , at all events , Congress will suspend any legislative act on this subject until we shall , by the constitution , be admitted into the Union , and have a right to adopt such a constitution , in this respect , as may comport with the wishes of a majority of the citizens .... The toleration of slavery is either right or wrong ; and if Congress should think , with us , that it is wrong , that it is inconsistent with the principles upon which our future constitution is to be formed , your memorialists will rest satisfied that , at least , this subject will not be by them taken up until the constitutional number of the citizens of this Territory shall assume that right . When the petition was signed and circulated , it gained six hundred more signatures than the petition circulated to request the legalization of slavery . The same year , the abolitionists won their first victory over the Harrison faction . In the election for territorial delegate , Jesse B. Thomas , the anti-slavery factions candidate , defeated Harrison 's candidate . By 1809 the territory 's population had climbed to over 20,000 . Congress passed legislation that allowed the Indiana Territory to elect a bicameral legislature and made the Legislative Council the upper house It also ordered Harrison to dissolve the existing one and created the Illinois Territory . The effect of these actions , was to cut the pro-slavery faction remaining in the Indiana Territory in half . The election resulted in a sweeping victory for the anti-slavery party . The new assembly quickly passed legislation revoking the indentured servitude laws of 1803 , and introduced legislation to prevent its reintroduction . They also passed laws aimed at preventing slave hunters from removing escaped slaves from the state . The repeal of the laws was met with resentment and violence in Vincennes . An effigy of Jesse Bright was burnt in the street , and Rice Jones , a popular abolitionist , was murdered . = = = Abolitionist victory = = = In 1809 , Dennis Pennington , one of the most outspoken anti-slavery men and a friend of Henry Clay , was elected to the legislature as the representative from Harrison County , and became speaker of the assembly . His prominence allowed him to dominate the legislature . Before the constitutional convention in 1816 , Pennington was quoted as saying \" Let us be on our guard when our convention men are chosen that they be men opposed to slavery . \" At the constitutional convention , the anti-slavery party was able to take control , electing Jennings as the president of the convention . It was by their actions that slavery was banned by the first constitution . When Indiana sought statehood in 1816 , there was talk of its entering as a slave state among the dwindling group of slavery supporters as illustrated in the March 2 , 1816 edition of the ( Vincennes ) Western Sun , where a \" citizen of Gibson \" stated , \" the best interests of humanity required the admission of slavery into the state . \" The eastern half of the state saw much debate over the slavery issue . While the state constitution did outlaw slavery and indentures , much of the population that had immigrated from the South were commoners and not landed slaveholders . Of the 43 men who wrote the constitution , 34 were either born or had once lived in the South , and the constitution was a near copy of the Kentucky constitution , save for the anti-slavery clause . During the first gubernatorial election , Jonathan Jennings 's campaign motto was \" No Slavery in Indiana \" . He easily defeated pro-slavery candidate Thomas Posey , and upon his victory he declared that Indiana was a \" Free State \" . He also asked the legislature to pass laws that would stop the \" unlawful attempts to seize and carry into bondage persons of color legally entitled to their freedom : and at the same time , as far as practical , to prevent those who rightfully owe service to the citizen of any other State of Territory , from seeking , within the limits of this State ( Indiana ) , a refuge from the possession of their lawful masters . \" He stated that such laws would help secure the freedom of many . This request resulted in the creation of a Man Stealing Act aimed to prevent slave hunters from operating in the state . In 1818 Dennis Pennington , then a state senator , had three Kentuckians indicted for violating the Man Stealing Act when they forcibly took a black woman from a home in Harrison County and removed her to Kentucky . Governor Jennings requested the Kentucky Governor send the men to Indiana for trials ; after several years of correspondence the Kentucky governor refused on constitutional grounds . These events led Jennings to eventually have to reverse his position and request that the legislature pass laws to discourage runaway slaves from seeking refuge in Indiana . Jennings said it was needed to \" maintain harmony between the states \" . From 1810 to 1820 , the number of free blacks in Indiana increased from 400 to 1200 . In 1820 the State Supreme Court case of Polly v. Lasselle ordered all slaves , except those held before the 1787 Northwest Territory Ordinance , to be freed . The new ruling led to a sharp decline in the state 's slave population . In 1820 the census recorded 190 slaves ; by the 1830 census there were only three . In 1823 , when Ohio passed resolutions asking the Federal government for a national ban on slavery , at the urging of Governor William Hendricks , the Indiana General Assembly issued a resolution which was forwarded the Federal government stating : \" Resolved That it is expedient that such a system should be predicated upon the principle that the evil of slavery is a national one and that the people and the States of this Union ought mutually to participate in the duties and burdens of removing it Therefore , \" Resolved By the General Assembly of the State of Indiana that we do approve of and cordially concur in the aforesaid resolutions of the State of Ohio and that His Excellency the Governor be requested to communicate the same to the Executives of each of the several States in the Union and each of our Senators and Representatives in Congress requesting their cooperation in all national measures to effect the grand object therein embraced . \" = = Indiana state = = = = = Remnants of slavery = = = Even with statehood , there was still slavery in Indiana . Despite slavery and indentures becoming illegal in 1816 due to the state constitution , the 1820 federal census listed 190 slaves in Indiana . Many Hoosier slaveholders felt that the 1816 constitution did not cover preexisting slavery ; others just did not care if it was illegal . In eastern Indiana nearly all slaveholders immediately freed their slaves . But the majority of slaveholders in western counties , especially in Knox , decided to keep their slaves . The Vincennes newspaper Western Sun had numerous times advertised \" indentured Negroes and other slaves \" , a sign of the approval of slavery in the area . \" In Knox County , virtually all of the ( slave ) suits were denied by the County Court in 1817 and 1818 . \" A black woman known as Polly was held slave by French trader Hyacinthe Lasselle of Vincennes . Polly sued in 1820 for her freedom , but was denied in the Knox County Court . She appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court , who ruled in her favor that she should be free . But even after this decision , there was slavery in Indiana . The federal census of 1830 still showed three slaves in Indiana : one each in Orange County , Decatur County , and Warrick County . A separate local census in Knox County in 1830 showed the presence of 32 slaves . Even in 1840 there were three slaves listed in the federal census as being in Indiana : a girl in Putnam County and a man and girl in Rush County . = = = Views upon slavery = = = A traveler from New York , Dr. Samuel Bernard Judah , described Vincennes in 1829 as having many blacks , making the observation of them being \u201c generally poorly clad \u2026 poor miserable race \u201d . Indiana Governor Noah Noble spoke with pride in December 1837 on how Indiana helped slaveholders recapture their escaped slaves . When Kentucky expressed displeasure at how some Hoosiers helped runaways , the Indiana legislature passed a resolution that stated acts by Northerners to interfere with the capture of runaways was \u201c unpatriotic and injurious to the stability of the Union . \u201d In 1851 Indiana adopted a new constitution , and among its new clauses was one that prohibited blacks from immigrating to Indiana . The prohibition was intended to be a punishment to the slavery states . Like several other northern states , Indiana lawmakers believed the majority of free blacks were uneducated and ill equipped to care for themselves . They believed since the South put them in that condition , they should be responsible for the \" burden \" of caring for them . This view , that the South should clean up its own mess , remained dominant even after the Civil War , and the clause in Indiana 's constitution was not repealed until the 20th century . = = = Abraham Lincoln = = = Abraham Lincoln lived in Indiana from 1816 until 1830 , age 7 to 21 . It was during these years that Lincoln first encountered slavery and began to form his opinions . Growing up in a climate where the state politics were run by men like Jennings and Pennington would have much influence on the development of Lincoln 's views . In 1860 when the American Civil War broke out , Indiana would remain part of the Union and contribute over 200,000 men to suppress the rebellion . By that act Hoosiers helped to outlaw slavery in the United States forever . = = = Underground Railroad = = = Many Indiana residents participated in the underground railroad . Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana . Tell City , Evansville , and Jeffersonville were two gateways to the underground railroad . An important stopover was Westfield , where food and hiding places were provided to slaves trying to reach Canada . Other safe houses dotted Indiana , including one in Town Clock Church ( pictured ) . Escaping slaves who entered Indiana would be ferried from safe house to safe house northward , usually into Michigan , where they could cross safely to Windsor , in Ontario , Canada . In one of the more famous events of the underground railroad , Eliza Harris , a slave from Kentucky , crossed the Ohio River one winter 's night when it froze over . She was aided in her escape by Levi Coffin of Fountain City , and eventually escaped to Ontario after being guided by Hoosiers from safe house to safe house through Indiana . Her story was the inspiration for the book Uncle Tom 's Cabin . Coffin and his wife would help as many as two thousand slaves escape the South .",

He served as leader of the Kentucky ( then part of Virginia ) militia throughout much of the war . Clark is best known for his celebrated captures of Kaskaskia ( 1778 ) and Vincennes ( 1779 ) during the Illinois Campaign , which greatly weakened British influence in the Northwest Territory . Because the British ceded the entire Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , Clark has often been hailed as the \" Conqueror of the Old Northwest \" . Clark 's military achievements all came before his 30th birthday . Afterwards he led militia in the opening engagements of the Northwest Indian War , but was accused of being drunk on duty . Despite his demand for a formal investigation into the accusations , he was disgraced and forced to resign . He left Kentucky to live on the Indiana frontier . Never fully reimbursed by Virginia for his wartime expenditures , Clark spent the final decades of his life evading creditors , and living in increasing poverty and obscurity . He was involved in two failed conspiracies to open the Spanish-controlled Mississippi River to American traffic . After suffering a stroke and the loss of his leg , Clark was aided in his final years by family members , including his younger brother William , one of the leaders of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . Clark died of a stroke on February 13 , 1818 . = = Early years = = George Rogers Clark was born on November 19 , 1752 in Charlottesville , Virginia , near the home of Thomas Jefferson . He was the second of ten children of John Clark and Ann Rogers Clark , who were Anglicans of English and Scots ancestry . Five of their six sons became officers during the American Revolutionary War . Their youngest son , William Clark , was too young to fight in the Revolution , but later became famous as a leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition . In about 1756 , after the outbreak of the French and Indian War ( part of the worldwide Seven Years ' War ) , the family moved away from the frontier to Caroline County , Virginia , and lived on a 400-acre ( 1.6 km2 ) plantation that later grew to over 2,000 acres ( 8.1 km2 ) . Little is known of Clark 's schooling . He lived with his grandfather so he could attend Donald Robertson 's school with James Madison and John Taylor of Caroline and received a common education . He was also tutored at home , as was usual for Virginian planters ' children of the period . Becoming a planter , he was taught to survey land by his grandfather . At age nineteen , Clark left his home on his first surveying trip into western Virginia . In 1772 , as a twenty-year-old surveyor , Clark made his first trip into Kentucky via the Ohio River at Pittsburgh . Thousands of settlers were entering the area as a result of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 . In 1774 , Clark was preparing to lead an expedition of ninety men down the Ohio River when war broke out with the American Indians . Although most of Kentucky was not inhabited by Indians , several tribes used the area for hunting . The tribes living in the Ohio country had not been party to the treaty signed with the Cherokee , which ceded the Kentucky hunting grounds to Britain for settlement . They attacked the European-American settlers to try to push them out of the area , conflicts that eventually culminated in Lord Dunmore 's War . Clark served in the war as a captain in the Virginia militia . = = Revolutionary War = = As the American Revolutionary War began in the East , settlers in Kentucky were involved in a dispute over the region 's sovereignty . Richard Henderson , a judge and land speculator from North Carolina , had purchased much of Kentucky from the Cherokee in an illegal treaty . Henderson intended to create a proprietary colony known as Transylvania , but many Kentucky settlers did not recognize Transylvania 's authority over them . In June 1776 , these settlers selected Clark and John Gabriel Jones to deliver a petition to the Virginia General Assembly , asking Virginia to formally extend its boundaries to include Kentucky . Clark and Jones traveled via the Wilderness Road to Williamsburg , where they convinced Governor Patrick Henry to create Kentucky County , Virginia . Clark was given 500 lb ( 230 kg ) of gunpowder to help defend the settlements and was appointed a major in the Kentucky County militia . Clark was just 24 years old , but older settlers such as Daniel Boone , Benjamin Logan , and Leonard Helm looked to him as a leader . = = = Illinois campaign = = = In 1777 , the American Revolutionary War intensified in Kentucky . Armed and encouraged by British lieutenant governor Henry Hamilton at Fort Detroit , Native Americans waged war and raided the Kentucky settlers in hopes of reclaiming the region as their hunting ground . The Continental Army could spare no men for an invasion of the Northwest or the defense of distant Kentucky , so its defense was left entirely to the local population . Clark participated in several skirmishes against the Native American raiders . As a leader of the defense of Kentucky , Clark believed that the best way to end these raids was to seize British outposts north of the Ohio River , thereby destroying British influence with the Indians . Clark asked Governor Patrick Henry of Virginia for permission to lead a secret expedition to capture the nearest British posts , which were located in the Illinois country . Governor Henry commissioned Clark as a lieutenant colonel in the Virginia militia and authorized him to raise troops for the expedition . In July 1778 , Clark and about 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia , taking it on the night of July 4 . Cahokia , Vincennes , and several other villages and forts in British territory were subsequently captured without firing a shot , because most of the French-speaking and American Indian inhabitants were unwilling to take up arms on behalf of the British . To counter Clark 's advance , Henry Hamilton reoccupied Vincennes with a small force . In February 1779 , Clark returned to Vincennes in a surprise winter expedition and retook the town , capturing Hamilton in the process . The winter expedition was Clark 's most significant military achievement and became the source of his reputation as an early American military hero . When news of his victory reached General George Washington , Clark 's success was celebrated and was used to encourage the alliance with France . Washington recognized his achievement had been gained without support from the regular army in men or funds . Virginia capitalized on Clark 's success by laying claim to the whole of the Old Northwest , calling it Illinois County . = = = Final years of the war = = = Clark 's ultimate goal during the Revolutionary War was to seize British-held Detroit , but he could never recruit enough men to make the attempt . The Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their homes by staying closer to Kentucky rather than making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit . In June 1780 , a mixed force of British and Indians , including Shawnee , Delaware , Wyandot and others , from Detroit invaded Kentucky with cannons , capturing two fortified settlements and carrying away hundreds of prisoners . In August 1780 , Clark led a retaliatory force that won a victory at the Shawnee village of Peckuwe , at what is now called George Rogers Clark Park near Springfield , Ohio . The next year Clark was promoted to brigadier general by Governor Thomas Jefferson , and was given command of all the militia in the Kentucky and Illinois counties . He prepared again to lead an expedition against Detroit . Although Washington transferred a small group of regulars to assist Clark , the detachment was disastrously defeated in August 1781 before they could meet up with Clark , ending the campaign . In August 1782 , another British-Indian force defeated the Kentucky militia at the Battle of Blue Licks . Although Clark had not been present at the battle , as senior military officer , he was severely criticized in the Virginia Council for the disaster . In response , Clark led another expedition into the Ohio country , destroying several Indian towns along the Great Miami River in the last major expedition of the war . The importance of Clark 's activities in the Revolutionary War has been the subject of much debate among historians . As early as 1779 he was called the Conqueror of the Northwest by George Mason . Because the British ceded the entire Old Northwest Territory to the United States in the 1783 Treaty of Paris , some historians , including William Hayden English , credit Clark with nearly doubling the size of the original Thirteen Colonies by seizing control of the Illinois country during the war . Clark 's Illinois campaign \u2014 particularly the surprise march to Vincennes \u2014 was greatly celebrated and romanticized . Other historians , such as Lowell Harrison , have downplayed the importance of the campaign in the peace negotiations and the outcome of the war , arguing that Clark 's \" conquest \" was little more than a temporary occupation . = = Later years = = Clark was just thirty years old when the Revolutionary War ended , but his greatest military achievements were already behind him . Ever since Clark 's victories in Illinois , settlers had been pouring into Kentucky , often illegally squatting on Indian land north of the Ohio River . From 1784 until 1788 Clark served as the superintendent-surveyor for Virginia 's war veterans and surveyed the lands granted to them for their service in the war . The position brought a small income , but Clark devoted very little time to the enterprise . Clark helped to negotiate the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785 and the Treaty of Fort Finney in 1786 with tribes north of the river , but violence between Native Americans and Kentucky settlers continued to escalate . According to a 1790 U.S. government report , 1,500 Kentucky settlers had been killed in Indian raids since the end of the Revolutionary War . In an attempt to end these raids , Clark led an expedition of 1,200 drafted men against Indian towns on the Wabash River in 1786 , one of the first actions of the Northwest Indian War . The campaign ended without a victory : lacking supplies , about three hundred militiamen mutinied , and Clark had to withdraw , but not before concluding a ceasefire with the Indians . It was rumored , most notably by James Wilkinson , that Clark had often been drunk on duty . When Clark learned of the rumors he demanded an official inquiry be made , but his request was declined by Governor of Virginia , and Virginia Council condemned Clark 's actions . Clark 's reputation was tarnished , he never again led men in battle , and he left Kentucky , moving into the Indiana frontier near Clarksville = = = Life in Indiana = = = Clark lived most of the rest of his life in financial difficulties . Clark had financed the majority of his military campaigns with borrowed funds . When creditors began to come to him for these unpaid debts , he was unable to obtain recompense from Virginia or the United States Congress because record keeping on the frontier during the war had been haphazard . For his services in the war Virginia gave Clark a gift of 150,000 acres ( 610 km2 ) of land . The soldiers who fought with Clark also received smaller tracts of land . Together with Clark 's Grant and his other holdings , his ownership encompassed all of present-day Clark County , Indiana and most of the surrounding counties . Although Clark had claims to tens of thousands of acres of land resulting from his military service and land speculation , he was \" land-poor \" , meaning that he owned much land but lacked the means to make money from it . With his career seemingly over and his prospects for prosperity doubtful , on February 2 , 1793 , Clark offered his services to Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat , the controversial ambassador of revolutionary France , hoping to earn money to maintain his estate . Western Americans were outraged that the Spanish , who controlled Louisiana , denied Americans free access to the Mississippi River , their only easy outlet for long distance commerce . The Washington Administration was also seemingly deaf to western concerns about opening the Mississippi to U.S. commerce . Clark proposed to Gen\u00eat that , with French financial support , he could lead an expedition to drive the Spanish out of the Mississippi Valley . Gen\u00eat appointed Clark \" Major General in the Armies of France and Commander-in-chief of the French Revolutionary Legion on the Mississippi River \" . Clark began to organize a campaign to seize New Madrid , St. Louis , Natchez , and New Orleans , getting assistance from old comrades such as Benjamin Logan and John Montgomery , and winning the tacit support of Kentucky governor Isaac Shelby . Clark spent $ 4,680 ( $ 59,161 in 2009 chained dollars ) of his own money for supplies . In early 1794 , however , President Washington issued a proclamation forbidding Americans from violating U.S. neutrality and threatened to dispatch General Anthony Wayne to Fort Massac to stop the expedition . The French government recalled Gen\u00eat and revoked the commissions he granted to the Americans for the war against Spain . Clark 's planned campaign gradually collapsed , and he was unable to convince the French to reimburse him for his expenses . Due to his growing debt , it became impossible for Clark to continue holding his land , since it became subject to seizure . Much of his land he deeded to friends or transferred to family members where it could be held for him , so that it would not be lost to his creditors . After a few years , the lenders and their assignees closed in and deprived the veteran of almost all of the property that remained in his name . Clark , once the largest landholder in the Northwest Territory , was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville , where he built a small gristmill which he worked with two African American slaves . Clark lived on for another two decades , and continued to struggle with alcohol abuse , a problem which had plagued him on-and-off for many years . He was very bitter about his treatment and neglect by Virginia , and blamed his misfortune on the state . The Indiana Territory chartered the Indiana Canal Company in 1805 to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio , near Clarksville . Clark was named to the board of directors and was part of the surveying team that assisted in laying out the route of the canal . The company collapsed the next year before construction could begin , when two of the fellow board members , including Vice President Aaron Burr , were arrested for treason . A large part of the company 's $ 1.2 million ( $ 60.5 million in 2009 chained dollars ) in investments was unaccounted for , and where the funds went was never determined . = = = Return to Kentucky = = = In 1809 Clark suffered a severe stroke . Falling into an operating fireplace , he suffered a burn on one leg so severe as to necessitate the amputation of the limb . It was impossible for Clark to continue to operate his mill , so he became a dependent member of the household of his brother-in-law , Major William Croghan , a planter at Locust Grove farm eight miles ( 13 km ) from the growing town of Louisville . During 1812 , the Virginia General Assembly granted Clark a pension of four hundred dollars per year , and finally recognized his services in the Revolution by granting him a ceremonial sword . After a second stroke , Clark died at Locust Grove , February 13 , 1818 , and was buried at Locust Grove Cemetery two days later . In his funeral oration , Judge John Rowan succinctly summed up the stature and importance of George Rogers Clark during the critical years on the Trans-Appalachian frontier : \" The mighty oak of the forest has fallen , and now the scrub oaks sprout all around . \" Clark 's body was exhumed along with the rest of his family members on October 29 , 1869 , and reburied at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville . Several years after Clark 's death the state of Virginia granted his estate $ 30,000 ( $ 568,853 in 2009 chained dollars ) as a partial payment on the debts that they owed him . The government of Virginia continued to find debt to Clark for decades , with the last payment to his estate being made in 1913 . Clark never married and he kept no account of any romantic relationships , although his family held that he had once been in love with Teresa de Leyba , sister of Don Fernando de Leyba , the Lieutenant Governor of Spanish Louisiana . Writings from his niece and cousin in the Draper Manuscripts attest to their belief in Clark 's lifelong disappointment over the failed romance . = = Legacy = = On May 23 , 1928 , President Calvin Coolidge ordered a memorial to George Rogers Clark to be erected in Vincennes . Completed in 1933 , the George Rogers Clark Memorial , built in Roman Classical style , stands on what was then believed to be the site of Fort Sackville , and is now the George Rogers Clark National Historical Park . It includes a statue of Clark by Hermon Atkins MacNeil . On February 25 , 1929 , to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the surrender of Fort Sackville , the U.S. Post Office Department issued a 2-cent postage stamp that depicted the surrender . In April 1929 , the Paul Revere Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution of Muncie , Indiana erected a monument to George Rogers Clark on Washington Avenue in Fredericksburg , Virginia . The marker doesn 't identify the connection between General Clark and Fredericksburg , so this choice of location is currently a mystery .

                    "text": "Simon Favre = Simon Favre ( May 31 , 1760 \u2013 July 3 , 1813 ) was an interpreter of the Muskogean languages , particularly Choctaw and Chickasaw , for the French , British , Spanish and Americans in the part of West Florida that became part of the states of Mississippi and Alabama . The son of another prominent interpreter , Favre spent the late 18th century in the vicinity of Mobile and the Tombigbee River , which changed hands from French to British , and then Spanish control . He became well versed in the language and culture of the Choctaws , and was involved with several treaties between the Europeans and natives . As a young man he had a Chocktaw mistress with whom he had six known children , then at the age of 41 he was legally married in Mobile to a woman of European descent . Within a few years of his marriage , he moved with his new family from the Tombigbee area to a plantation on the Pearl River . As the power of the Choctaws diminished , Favre became less important as an interpreter , and more important as a facilitator of the political changes occurring along the Gulf Coast . Once the Louisiana Purchase was concluded between France and the United States , American settlers from both inside and outside Spanish West Florida increased pressure on Spain for American control of the territory . While the transfer did not officially take place until 1821 , the Spanish essentially put Florida under the trust of the United States in 1810 , and Favre played a major role in facilitating the transfer , and keeping the Indians informed of the events . Favre was considered the top interpreter in the region by men of prominence , including Governor William C. C. Claiborne of Louisiana who made Favre a justice of the peace , and recommended him for the position of United States agent to the Choctaws . A \" talk \" that Favre gave to the Choctaws on the eve of the War of 1812 was touted by historian Russell Guerin as a masterpiece of diplomacy , and displayed Favre 's deep understanding of the native language and culture . Favre died in 1813 , leaving many minor children and a substantial estate of more than 5000 acres of land and 57 slaves . He had 13 known children with three different women , and leaves numerous descendants . A well-known descendant is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre . Simon Favre 's associations with property owners and prominent officials demonstrate that he was a person of very high social standing . = = Life = = = = = Ancestry = = = Born near Mobile , then a part of French Louisiana , on May 31 , 1760 , Simon Favre was the son of Jean Claude Favre ( 1721 \u2013 1782 ) and Marguerite Wiltz ( 1740 \u2013 1805 ) . His grandfather , Jean Baptiste Favre , came from Royan , France , and by tradition was a cabin boy when Pierre D 'Iberville placed him on shore near Biloxi to make contact with the natives . His father was a government interpreter who was commissioned to explain the terms of the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) to the natives upon the conclusion of the French and Indian War . Favre 's mother was the daughter of a Swiss soldier . = = = Early life = = = Learning from his father , Favre became fluent in the languages of French , English , Spanish , and the Muskogean languages including Choctaw and Chickasaw . The lands along the Gulf coast were held by the British for nearly two decades following the 1763 Treaty of Paris , but their ability to maintain control diminished during that time . On September 3 , 1783 the British ceded their lands in both East and West Florida to Spain under the Treaty of Versailles . Favre 's father had just died the year before this treaty , and Simon Favre followed his father 's career , also inheriting his father 's plantation on the Pearl River , though continuing to reside in Mobile near his mother . Favre spent his early adult years among the natives along the Tombigbee River , being initially employed by the French as an interpreter of the Choctaw language , but soon coming into the employ of the British and later the Spanish . Favre also understood the Chickasaw language , but at one point his translation was challenged by James Colbert ( grandfather of Holmes Colbert ) , who had married into the Chickasaw tribe , and was asked by the tribe to replace Favre as interpreter . Favre was said to be a confidante and personal friend of the celebrated Choctaw Indian chief Pushmataha . Genealogist Heitzmann relates that at one point Favre acted as the interpreter between Pushmataha and the military commanders Andrew Jackson and General Thomas Hinds . In 1792 Juan De la Villebeuvre , who worked among the Indians on behalf of the Spanish government , was named a special commissioner to the Choctaws and Chickasaws . Favre 's reputation as a competent and valuable interpreter grew quickly , and in an undated letter to Governor Francisco Carondelet , De la Villebeuvre wrote , \" ... I am going to reside with Favre , who is employed by the king [ of Spain ] and who will serve me as interpreter . He is the best one of the province , with a great influence over the minds of the Indians , and he knows how to lead them firmly whenever necessary . \" Favre built a house for De la Villebeuvre about 12 miles from the village of the Choctaw chief Franchimastabee with whom Favre had become friendly . Favre was present at Fort Nogales , located in Choctaw territory near the mouth of the Yazoo River , when the Treaty of Nogales was signed on October 28 , 1793 . The treaty was between Spain ( and signed by the king ) and the Alibamon , Cherokee , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek and Tallapoosa nations . Representing the Choctaws were chiefs Franchimastabee and Pushmataha , while Favre signed as a witness . In January 1794 Favre wrote a letter to Don Manuel Lanzos , Spanish commander at Natchez , warning of a great rumor among the Choctaws that the Americans were coming to destroy them . The Choctaws were in difficult straits at the time , from both the consumption of alcohol and from a corn crop failure brought on by an earlier drought . They were stealing horses from other tribes as well as from the Europeans , and Favre himself had three horses stolen while staying near the Tombigbee . De la Villebeuvre felt that these actions were being instigated by the Americans , and Favre was sent to the Choctaw villages to assess the feelings of the natives . Following the Treaty of Boukfouka on May 10 , 1793 , the Spaniards built a fort on the location where the French had earlier built Fort Tombecbe , and named it Confederacion in honor of the alliance between the Spanish and Indians . In the late 1700s Favre was living near Fort Confederation , but sometime after 1797 moved to St. Stephens . He moved into a house across the road from Augustin Rochon , his future father-in-law . After spending time there and at various other locations along the Tombigbee , Favre returned to Mobile before 1800 where he occupied a house on Loyal Street . While there , he associated with other interpreters including J. B. Roussere and Simon Andry . Favre also maintained very close ties with New Orleans , and he called himself of that city in the 1800 baptismal record for his son Simon . = = = Pearl River = = = After having seven children with two other women , Favre was legally married in Mobile in 1801 to Celeste Rochon . Sometime between 1804 and 1806 , following the birth of two children in Mobile , he moved with his new family to one of his plantations on the Pearl River , near what became Pearlington , Mississippi . This was shortly following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 , when the Americans were showing a great interest in West Florida , still governed by Spain . Favre then became an important interpreter in the service of the Americans , as well as continuing to work for the Spanish who were eventually compelled to give up control of their Florida lands . While Favre 's importance had initially sprung from his influence with the native tribes , particularly the Choctaws , as the power of these people declined he became much more important as an intermediary during the turbulent times of transition from Spanish to American rule in West Florida . During this period early in the 19th century , the Spanish authorities were losing their hold on West Florida for a variety of reasons . One such reason was piracy , while another was American encroachment following the Louisiana Purchase . Many Americans felt that West Florida should have been included in the purchase . One means used by Spain to attempt to hold on to this region was to commission several important settlers to work for their government . In this regard , Favre was assigned to confirm land deeds that the Spanish were doling out at an accelerated rate , to attempt to stem the tide of American encroachment . Favre also provided intelligence and military maps to the Spanish concerning the activities of not only the Americans , who were applying pressure from outside the jurisdiction , but also rebels along the Pearl River and nearby coast . The rebels , led by Reuben Kemper and his brothers , were causing difficulties from within , and had been attempting to pull West Florida from Spanish control for several years . Under the Spanish , Favre became known as the commander of the District of Bay St. Louis . Many of the land titles that were awarded by Favre were later reviewed by the United States government and appear in the collection of American state papers . With Americans in control of New Orleans , mail from Fort Stoddard , near Mobile , had to pass through Spanish territory to get there . In 1808 the United States Postmaster wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury that Favre , who was still a Spanish subject , served as an agent for the post office , forwarding the mail passing through Spanish lands . Though West Florida was not officially ceded to the United States until 1819 under the provisions of the Adams-Onis Treaty , in November 1810 Spanish governor Folach , demanding secrecy , essentially delivered both East and West Florida to the United States in trust . This was done in hopes that the \" robberies and depredations \" upon the citizens would cease , and under the realization that the transfer was inevitable . Soon thereafter American officials began managing the Florida lands , setting up administrative regions within them , and the western part of West Florida ( the part in present-day Louisiana ) was absorbed into the United States under the proclamation of President James Madison . When Louisiana became a state in 1812 , the remainder of West Florida ( the panhandles of Mississippi and Alabama ) was absorbed by the United States . The western part of this newly annexed Mobile District was organized into Hancock and Harrison Counties ( soon a part of the Mississippi Territory ) , and in 1813 American federal troops were stationed there to formalize the transition . = = = Late career and death = = = Just as his father had made the transition from French to British rule , Favre likewise had little difficulty changing his allegiance from the Spanish to the Americans , and he continued to hold a prominent position in the region . In January 1811 Favre was chosen by the Orleans territorial governor William C. C. Claiborne as a magistrate of the \" Parish of Biloxi \" which was within the territory . When Claiborne became the Louisiana governor following statehood in 1812 , he commissioned Favre as a justice of the peace , and clearly admired him , calling him in a letter an educated and very agreeable man who would make an energetic officer . At the outset of the War of 1812 , the Americans were interested in assessing the alignment of the native tribes in regards to their loyalty to Britain . In August 1812 Claiborne sent Favre to present a talk to the native tribes of West Florida . Favre 's carefully crafted words , presented under Claiborne 's name , provide an example of the diplomatic skill with which Favre was able to address the language and culture of the Muskogean tribes . While the goal of Favre and the governor was to keep the Choctaws and other tribes out of the \" white man 's war \" , ultimately the Creeks aligned themselves with the British , and the Americans requested assistance from the Choctaws . In a letter to Secretary of War John Armstrong , Claiborne recommended that \" Colonel Simon Favre \" become a United States agent for the Choctaws . Favre held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the Hancock County militia , and early in the War of 1812 he was able to negotiate with the Choctaws to provide assistance against Britain 's Creek allies . Favre died in the summer of 1813 , and though he was living along the Pearl River , court testimony by Peter Moran in 1845 stated that he died in Mobile , and had not been there long before his death . A letter by Mississippi governor David Holmes , dated August 1 , 1813 , mentions the \" absence of Colonel Favre at Mobile \" and \" his subsequent death \" . Favre 's daughter Mary stated that he died on July 21 , but an obituary that appeared in a New Orleans newspaper on July 20 gives his death date as July 3 . Several years after his death , in 1817 or 1818 , his widow married Isaac Graves , with whom she had one additional child , and they lived in Pearlington , Mississippi . Graves had been the operator of Favre 's schooner , Pearl , and had very little estate , but following his marriage to Favre 's widow , he utilized Favre 's estate as his own , much to the disadvantage of Favre 's heirs . = = Favre 's \" wives \" = = While a young man , conducting his business among the Choctaws , Favre consummated a relationship with a native woman named Pistikiokonay , who may have been a daughter of the Choctaw Chief Pushmataha , since there was a documented relationship between Favre and this chief . Over a period of about 15 years Favre sired at least six chldren with this woman , the first of whom was born in about 1784 . Shortly before 1800 he then had a relationship with a woman whose first name has been given as Rebecca or Rosella , and whose last name has been written as Austin or Ostein , with other spelling variations . In 1800 he had an illegitimate son born of this union , and this son , Simon , Jr . , was later named prominently in his will . In 1801 a number of slave exchanges took place between Favre and Austin , as he prepared to marry another woman . On March 25 , 1801 he was legally married to Celeste Rochon , a daughter of Augustine Rochon and Luisa Fievre of Mobile , with whom he had six more children . = = Land holdings and slaves = = In 1806 Favre began cultivation of land on the Pearl River in what became Hancock County , Mississippi . Favre 's land holdings were extensive , and his will mentions eight different plantations totalling over 5000 acres in area . He also acquired 57 slaves shortly before his death , as they were not mentioned in his will , but later became prominently mentioned during the settlement of his estate . The October 1814 inventory of his personal property includes a list of the 57 slaves , giving the name , age , and value of each . The oldest was 80 and valued at $ 5.00 , while the most valuable was a 30-year-old \" cow hunter \" valued at $ 900 . Collectively , the slaves were valued at just under $ 15,000 . The inventory also mentioned 6200 arpents ( 5247 acres ) of land valued at $ 2410 , a schooner named Pearl , and 450 head of cattle . One of Favre 's properties on the Pearl River was originally settled by his father in 1767 , and was inherited by Favre upon his father 's death in 1782 . This plantation later became known as the town of Napoleon , and Favre kept a store there that later became a part of the community 's church . In 1961 all the residents of the town were moved when the property was declared within the buffer zone of the John C. Stennis Space Center . Another one of his Pearl River properties became the town of Pearlington , Mississippi , where many of his children , including those of his Choctaw mistress , lived . Though Favre lived in Hancock County in West Florida , and died in Mobile , Mississippi Territory , documents concerning his estate were also filed in New Orleans , Louisiana , probably by his Hancock County attorney , Rutillius Pray of Pearlington . By 1826 the estate had been partially settled , and during the October court term Pray submitted a final settlement showing total sales from the estate of just under $ 27,000 ( including nearly $ 22,000 for slaves ) , while total debts amounted to nearly $ 33,000 . However , taking into account unsold assets , the estate appears to have been solvent . = = Family = = Favre 's earliest known children were with his Choctaw mistress named Pistikiokonay . This woman lived in what later became Lauderdale County , Mississippi , though most of her children moved to Hancock County where Favre had two large plantations along the Pearl River . Favre had six known or suspected children with her , the earliest born about 1784 , and the last possibly born about 1805 , though without birth records there is uncertainty among most of the birth years . The oldest child was likely Alexis ( male ) , born about 1784 ( based on a deposition he made in 1844 , calling himself aged 60 ) ; he married a Choctaw named Cuna and had several children . A second child , Katherine , died after 1830 without issue . Louis , possibly the third child , had a wife named \" Milisew \" and four children ; he died between 1830 and 1835 . Charles , born about 1798 ( deposed in 1856 that he was 58 years old ) , married Carmelite LaFontaine , had several children , and died by 1868 . Mary , born about 1800 ( aged 70 in the 1870 census ) , never married , but was highly respected in the family and became the administratrix of her father 's estate . Favre 's youngest child with his Choctaw mistress appears to be Jean Baptiste , usually just called Baptiste , who was born about 1805 ( aged about 40 in 1845 ) , married a woman named Toshowahoke , and had two children . In 1800 Favre had an illegitimate son with Rebecca Austin ( also called Rosella Ostein ) , a native of Tombigbee in the District of Mobile . The child , named Simon , was born February 5 , 1800 . Favre left a bequest to the child in 1812 so that he could \" be taught to read and write and to learn a trade or profession . \" Favre had six children with his legal wife , Celeste Rochon , the oldest of whom was Jean ( John ) , born August 2 , 1802 , died January 7 , 1888 , and married Dianna Edwards . Augustine ( Gus ) was born July 17 , 1804 and had two wives , Eleanor and Mary Jane , whose maiden names are uncertain . The third child of this marriage , Onezan ( Nezan ) , was born December 23 , 1806 , died May 10 , 1875 , and married Mary Moody . Next was Louisa Eucharist , born May 15 , 1809 , who married first James Conerly , and then John L. Armstrong . The fifth child was Marguerite , born January 17 , 1812 , died February 6 , 1908 , and married James Murphy . The last child of this marriage was Carlota , who was confirmed in New Orleans in February 1813 , and thus does not appear in her father 's 1812 will . She is not mentioned as an heir of Simon , so may have died young . Probably the best known of Favre 's descendants is former National Football League quarterback Brett Favre , who descends from Simon 's Choctaw mistress , through their son Louis .",

                    "text": "Oliver P. Morton = Oliver Hazard Perry Throck Morton ( August 4 , 1823 \u2013 November 1 , 1877 ) , commonly known as Oliver P. Morton , was a U.S. Republican Party politician from Indiana . He served as the 14th Governor of Indiana during the American Civil War , and was a stalwart ally of President Abraham Lincoln . During the war , Morton thwarted and neutralized the Democratic-controlled Indiana General Assembly . He exceeded his constitutional authority by calling out the militia without approval , and during the period of legislative suppression he privately financed the state government through unapproved federal and private loans . He was criticized for arresting and detaining political enemies and suspected southern sympathizers . As one of President Lincoln 's \" war governors \" , Morton made signification contributions to the war effort , more than any other man in the state , and earned the lifelong gratitude of former Union soldiers for his support . During his second term as governor , and after being partially paralyzed by a stroke , he was elected to serve in the U.S. Senate . He was a leader among the Radical Republicans of the Reconstruction era , and supported numerous bills designed to reform the former Southern Confederacy . In 1877 , during his second term in the Senate , Morton suffered a second debilitating stroke that caused a rapid deterioration in his health ; he died later that year . Morton was mourned nationally and his funeral procession was witnessed by thousands . He is buried in Indianapolis 's Crown Hill Cemetery . = = Early life = = = = = Family and background = = = Morton was an Indiana native born in Wayne County near the small settlement of Salisbury on August 4 , 1823 , to James Throck and Sarah Miller Morton . His grandfather had shortened the family 's surname , Throckmorton , to Morton , but the males in the family carried Throck as a middle name . He was named for Oliver Hazard Perry , the victorious Commodore in the Battle of Lake Erie . Morton disliked his name from an early age , and before beginning his political career he shortened it to Oliver Perry Morton , dropping the middle names of Hazard and Throck . His mother died when he was three , and he was raised by his maternal grandparents . He spent most of his young life living with them in Ohio . Morton returned to eastern Indiana as a young man , and joined his family at Centerville . Leaving school at the age of fifteen , Morton briefly worked as an apothecary 's clerk , but left after a dispute with the proprietor and apprenticed as a hat maker . After four years in the hat-making business he became dissatisfied and quit to enroll at Miami University in Oxford , Ohio , where he studied for two years , and briefly attended Cincinnati College to continue his law studies . In 1845 he returned to Centerville and was admitted to the Indiana bar in 1846 . Morton formed a law practice with Judge Newman and became a successful and moderately wealthy attorney . Morton married Lucinda Burbank in 1845 . The couple had five children , but only two survived infancy . = = = Early political career = = = In 1852 Morton campaigned and was elected to serve as a circuit court judge , but resigned after only a year ; he found that he preferred to practice law . By 1854 he was active in Indiana politics . Initially , Morton was an anti-slavery Democrat , but living in a region dominated by the Whig Party he had little hope of furthering a political career without changing his party affiliation . Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act ( 1854 ) , which repealed the Missouri Compromise 's ban on slavery in the western territories , beyond Missouri , had a divisive effect on both parties . As the Democrats divided over the issue , Morton took a stand with the Free Soil supporters and opposed the Act . Under the influence of U.S. Senator Jesse D. Bright , the state 's Democrats expel its anti-slavery members , including Morton , from the Indiana state convention in 1854 . That same year Morton joined with other political factions to form the People 's party , the forerunner to the state 's Republican party . By February 1856 Morton had made his way to the newly formed Republican party at the national level as a member of the resolutions committee to the preliminary national convention that met in Pittsburgh . He also served as a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia . Thirty-two-year-old Morton became the People 's / Republican candidate for governor of Indiana in 1856 . His Democratic opponent was Ashbel P. Willard , a popular state senator . Despite a hard-fought campaign that for the first time brought Morton to the attention of voters around the state , Willard defeated him in the general election by fewer than 6,000 votes , amid charges on both sides of fraudulent voting . Radical Republican George W. Julian , who detested Morton , contended that Morton did not take a strong enough position against slavery , and , as conservative former Whigs claimed , he had been too lenient on the issue in a state where southern-born residents wanted nothing to do with blacks or abolitionism . Despite these criticisms , Morton 's anti-slavery speeches made him popular among the Republicans in Indiana . Noted for his \" plain and convincing \" manner of speaking , Morton 's contemporaries said he was not \" eloquent or witty \" , but rather \" logical and reasonable \" . By 1858 , the People 's party had officially adopted the name of Republican , and in 1860 the Republicans nominated Morton for lieutenant governor of Indiana on a ticket with the more conservative former Whig , Henry S. Lane , as its gubernatorial candidate . Savvy Republican politicians thought that Morton would be seen as too radical and could not carry the former Know-Nothing vote in the southern half of the state , while a man of Whig antecedents like Lane would . Because both men had strong support within the party , and neither had much desire to make open war on one another , a compromise was arranged , giving Lane the gubernatorial nomination and Morton the nomination for lieutenant governor . Both nominees understood that if they carried the state and a Republican majority was elected to the state legislature in the fall , the Indiana General Assembly would choose Lane for a seat in the U.S. Senate and Morton would become the successor to the Indiana governorship . The campaign focused primarily on the prevailing issues of the nation , including homesteading legislation , tariffs , and the looming possibility of civil war . Lane and Morton won in the state 's general election and the Republicans gained control of the state legislature . As it had been pre-arranged with the candidates , on the day after Lane 's inauguration as governor , the General Assembly chose him to fill a U.S. Senate seat . Lane resigned immediately and Morton succeeded him to become the fourteenth governor of Indiana on January 18 , 1861 , and its first governor to be born in the state . = = Governor = = = = = War effort = = = Morton served as governor of Indiana for six years ( 1861 \u2013 1867 ) and strongly supported the Union during the Civil War . While others urged compromise and conciliation , Morton demanded an end to concession discussions , with no further compromise , and , if necessary , the use of force to preserve the Union . In a speech he delivered on November 22 , 1860 , Morton declared : \" If it is worth a bloody struggle to establish this nation , it is worth one to preserve it . \" He was also a staunch supporter of President Abraham Lincoln 's conduct of the war . Morton , who was not in favor of conciliation , believed his role as Indiana 's governor was \" to denounce treason and uphold the cause of the Union . \" Morton also believed that war was inevitable and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor . Morton appointed men to positions in state government who opposed any compromise with the southern states . He also established without legislative permission a state arsenal , where up to 700 men produced ammunition , and made many other preparations for the impending war . Three days after the war began on April 12 , 1861 , at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina , Governor Morton telegraphed President Lincoln offering 10,000 volunteers from Indiana under arms to help suppress the rebellion . By the end of April , about 12,000 Hoosier volunteers had signed up to fight for the Union , exceeding the state 's initial quota of six regiments ( 4,683 men ) . In a special session of the Indiana General Assembly held on April 24 , 1861 , Morton called for Indiana 's politicians to set aside party considerations and unite in defense of the Union . He also received the state legislature 's authority to borrow and spend funds to purchase arms and supplies for Indiana 's troops . Among Lincoln 's \" war governors \" , who were critically important in the early prosecution of the war , \" no governor played his role more valiantly or effectively than did Morton . \" Although Morton 's efforts were not without controversy and garnered significant opposition from his political adversaries , his greatest strength during the war was his ability to raise volunteers and money for the Union army and to equip them for battle . Morton also successfully suppressed Indiana 's Confederate sympathizers . As the leader of the Republicans in the state , he confronted the Peace Democrats , especially the \" Copperheads \" . Lincoln and Morton maintained a close alliance during the war , although Lincoln was wary at times of Morton 's ruthlessness . Lincoln also recognized the Indiana governor had significant fears , once remarking that Morton was \" a good fellow , but at times he is the skeeredest person I know . \" Morton was especially afraid that Kentucky , across the Ohio River from Indiana 's southern border , would secede from the Union and pose a threat to Indiana 's security . Morton went to great lengths to ensure that Indiana contributed as much as possible to the war effort . He was not afraid to criticize others if he felt Indiana 's interests were being overlooked . Morton frequently clashed with federal authorities and military leaders over recruitment policies , regimental assignments , appointment of military leaders , purchases of supplies , and the care given to sick and wounded soldiers , among other issues . Although he wanted Indiana to receive as much recognition as other states , Morton 's political opponents often challenged his efforts . Governor Morton once complained to Lincoln that \" no other free state is so populated with southerners \" , which he believed kept him from being as forceful as he wanted to be . In 1862 Morton attended the Loyal War Governors ' Conference in Altoona , Pennsylvania , organized by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Gregg Curtin , that gave Lincoln the support needed for his Emancipation Proclamation . Emancipation and the conscription of men to fight a protracted war became major issues that divided Republicans and Democrats during Morton 's tenure as governor . = = = Conflict with the General Assembly = = = Although Morton was able to keep the state united during the first phase of the war , once emancipation became an issue in 1862 , the Republicans suffered a major defeat in the mid-term elections , and Morton lost the support of the strong Democratic majority in the legislature . Before the new legislature convened in 1863 , Morton began circulating reports that the Democrats intended to seize control of the state government , secede from the Union , and instigate riots . The Democrats responded with harsh criticisms of Morton and Lincoln , the conduct of the war , and the issues of emancipation and the loss of constitutional rights , among others . Accusations on both sides created a tense atmosphere that only worsened relation between the two parties and guaranteed further confrontations . Morton had already made several unconstitutional moves by acting on his own authority without legislative approval , including the establishment of the state arsenal , and the Democrats drafted legislation that attempted to reduce his authority . When Democrats in the state legislature sought to remove the state militia from Morton 's command and transfer it to a state board of Democratic commissioners , the governor immediately disbanded the Indiana General Assembly . He feared that once in control of militia , the Democrats might attempt to force him from office and secede from the Union . Morton issued secret instructions to Republican legislators , asking them to stay away from Indianapolis , the state capital , to prevent the General Assembly from attaining the quorum needed to pass any legislation . All but four Republicans fled to Madison , Indiana , where they could quickly flee into Kentucky if the Democrats attempted to force their return to Indianapolis . Without the enactment of an appropriations bill , the state government would not have funds to operate , and the Democrats assumed that Morton would be forced to call a special session and recall the Republicans . The Democrats hoped to once again press their measures to weaken the governor , but Morton was aware of their plans . Going beyond his constitutional powers , Morton solicited millions of dollars in federal and private loans . Morton 's move to subvert the state legislature was successful ; he was able to privately fund the state government and the war effort in Indiana . Former Hoosier James Lanier of the New York banking firm of Winslow , Lanier and Company loaned Morton funds to pay interest on the state 's debt until the state government could resume its revenue collecting efforts . Morton 's moves caused considerable rage among the Democrats , who launched a vicious attack on the governor . He responded by accusing his Democratic opponents of treason . Following the suppression of the General Assembly in 1862 , Morton asked General Henry B. Carrington for assistance in organizing the state 's levies for service . He also established an intelligence network under Carrington 's leadership to deal with rebel sympathizers affiliated with the Knights of the Golden Circle , and , beginning in 1863 , the American Knights , which merged with the Sons of Liberty . Members of these secret groups included Democrats and others who supported states-rights and opposed the Union cause during the war . Carrington succeeded in keeping the state secure , but his operatives also carried out arbitrary arrests , suppressed freedom of speech and freedom of association , and generally maintained repressive control over the southern-sympathetic minority . In an incident that would later be referred to as the Battle of Pogue 's Run , Morton had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention , where many leaders of the Democratic Party were arrested , detained , or threatened . Morton also urged pro-war Democrats to abandon their party in the name of unity for the duration of the war , and met with some success . Former governor Joseph A. Wright was among the Democrats who had been expelled from the party in 1854 , and in an attempt to show his bipartisanship , Morton appointed him to the U.S. Senate . In reaction to Morton 's actions against dissenters , the Indiana Democratic Party called Morton a \" Dictator \" and an \" Underhanded Mobster . \" Republicans countered that the Democrats were using \" treasonable and obstructionist tactics in the conduct of the war \" . Morton illegally \u2014 without approval from the state legislature \u2014 called out the state militia in July 1863 to counter Morgan 's Raid , an incident where Confederate raiders under Confederate General John Hunt Morgan crossed the Ohio River into southern Indiana . Large-scale support for the Confederacy among Golden Circle members and southern Hoosiers in general declined after Morgan 's raiders ransacked many homes bearing the banners of the Golden Circle , despite their proclaimed support for the Confederate cause . After Hoosiers failed to support Morgan 's troops in significant numbers , Morton slowed his crackdown on Confederate sympathizers within the state , theorizing that because the Copperheads had failed to come to Morgan 's aid in large numbers , they would similarly fail to aid a larger invasion . Despite his controversial actions , one notable thing historians record from this period during Morton 's first term as governor was the honesty with which the government was run . All of the borrowed money was accounted for with no political corruption and repaid in the years after the war . It was by these honest actions that Morton was able to avoid repercussions when the state legislature reconvened after Morton 's reelection , this time with a new Republican majority . = = = Second term = = = In 1864 the war was nearing its end , but many Hoosiers were war weary and saw no end in sight as they prepared for the state 's next gubernatorial election . Indiana 's constitution prohibited a governor to serve more than four years in any eight-year period , but Morton was elected as Indiana 's lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane 's term , so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election . The Democrats were furious and launched a bitter campaign against Morton , who did not do a great deal of campaigning . Instead , he successfully returned about 9,000 active-duty soldiers home on leave to vote in the election , presumably for Morton , \" the soldier 's friend \" , and his fellow Republicans . Morton was reelected to office , defeating Democrat and longtime friend Joseph McDonald by more than 20,000 votes . Although the campaign was conducted in time of war , with both parties strongly opposing the other , both Morton and McDonald remained friends after the campaign and later served together in the U.S. Senate . Many Democrats claimed that Morton had rigged the election because Republicans retook the majority in both houses of the Assembly . Morton was partially crippled by a paralytic stroke in October 1865 which incapacitated him for a time . For treatment , Morton traveled to Europe where he sought the assistance of several specialists , but none were able to help his paralysis . During his recovery , Lieutenant Governor Conrad Baker served as acting governor . With the war ending , Baker oversaw the demobilization of most of the state 's forces . Morton returned to the governorship in March 1866 , but he was never again able to walk without assistance . = = Senator = = = = = First term = = = In 1867 , Morton was elected by the Indiana General Assembly to serve as a U.S. Senator . He resigned from his post as governor that same year and turned over the leadership of the state government to Lieutenant Governor Baker . In the U.S. Senate , Morton became a member of the foreign affairs committee and quickly grew to become a Republican leader . He was also made chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections . Because of his stroke , Morton always sat while delivering his speeches , but he was noted by other senators for his effectiveness in speaking and debating . Morton 's close observers saw a man of untiring activity , \" of unfaltering determination , quick as well as far-seeing ... \" Restless and full of energy , one newspaper commentated , \" He accommodated himself with a kind of cynical indifference to his crippled body , as to a house badly out of repair , and dragged it about with him as a snail does a shell . \" As a U.S. Senator , \" he excused himself from no duties ; acted as chairman and member of several committees ; was never absent from his seat , and was ready for debate at all times . \" Unfriendly sources described Morton in exceedingly negative terms . \" With a superabundance of the quality called ' force , ' Senator Morton possesses one of the most terrible natures in public life , \" and as news correspondent George Alfred Townsend described him : \" A dark , determined , brooding and desperate mind is reflected in his warthy complexion and introspective eyes . His powerful frame , prematurely wrecked , yet carrying alive the savage will , towers on his crutch , and in his very hobble is the tyrant 's pace .... He wants to be terrible for the sake of freedom . His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism . Like all bloody bigots , he thinks he feels God 's mercy moving in him . \" Morton , who served in the U.S. Senate during Reconstruction , supported much of the Radical Republican program for re-making the former Confederate states . Early in his first term , Morton supported legislation to eliminate all civil government in the southern states and impose a military government . He also supported legislation to void the southern states ' constitutions \u2014 in nearly every case imposed in 1865 without being submitted to the voters \u2014 and to require elections for representatives to state constitutional conventions that would be charged with writing new ones . In addition , he voted in favor of provisions declaring that the new state constitutions would go into effect only if adopted by a majority of registered voters , not just those voting in the special elections that called for the constitutions ' adoption . At the same time , he favored stringent restrictions on former Confederates who were permitted to vote , in particular those who had taken an oath to support the United States Constitution , and had served the Confederate States of America in a political office or in its military . During the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson , Morton voted in favor of conviction , as did most moderate and all Radical Republicans , and openly voiced his disappointment at Johnson 's acquittal . Although Morton delivered a speech in the fall of 1865 arguing that the recently freed slaves were unready for the vote , and once worked to end Indiana 's so-called \" Black Laws \" that restricted blacks ' basic civil rights , and the state constitutional provision forbidding their entry into the state , he reversed his position after the war . By 1866 Morton had come to share the general Republican belief that the only means of guaranteeing loyalty to governments protective of black civil rights must be through giving adult males of every race the franchise . As he explained , \" I confess , and I do it without shame , that I have been educated by the great events of War . \" He championed the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment , and when the Democrats began to resign en masse from the Senate during its debate to prevent a quorum , Morton engineered a maneuver that kept the bill in the docket and allowed it to be passed . U.S. Senator George Frisbie Hoar once judged Morton as a man with \" little regard for Constitutional scruples . \" Not that Morton would have willfully flouted his oath to uphold the U.S. Constitution , but Hoar added , \" he believed that the Constitution should be interpreted in the light of the Declaration of Independence , so as to be the law of life to a great , powerful , and free people . To this principle of interpretation , all strict or narrow criticism , founded on its literal meaning , must yield . \" If so , Hoar 's assessment put Morton in the same category as U.S. Senator Charles Sumner , who openly declared the Declaration 's decree that all men were created equal the defining words by which all constitutional duty should be judged . After President-elect Ulysses S. Grant 's inauguration in 1869 , Morton became one of the Grant administration 's most able and reliable floor leaders . Morton helped shepherd through the bill readmitting Virginia to representation in Congress and voted in favor of the treaty annexing Santo Domingo to the United States . Later , he countered Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner of Massachusetts in a bitter debate over the president 's motives and intentions towards the Caribbean nation and its people . In the Senate Morton argued in favor of the Enforcement Act ( 1871 ) , also known as the so-called Ku-Klux Act , that gave the president expanded power to oppose terrorism in the Deep South . Morton , known as a masterful waver of the \" bloody shirt \" , was unstinting in his efforts to connect the Democrats to wartime treason and peacetime violence , and generally could be relied on to provide a ready and strong defense of the federal government 's right to intervene and enforce the protection of the civil rights of black Americans . Morton championed the right of Louisiana 's black leader , Pinckney B. S. Pinchback , to a seat in the U.S. Senate , although the effort was unsuccessful . Morton voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1875 , and had his strongest support in 1876 among black Republicans in an increasingly \" solid South \" . The Grant administration , who recognized Morton as a powerful friend , offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain , replacing John Lothrop Motley , but Morton declined . Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats , Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat . In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States . ( Later , Grant recalled that concerns over Morton 's ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice , but Grant may have mistaken . Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered a place on the Supreme Court , unofficially , and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the job would cause Morton a physical breakdown ) . = = = Second term = = = Morton was reelected to the U.S. Senate in 1873 , and began his second term in 1874 . His stand on paper money added to his controversial reputation . During a time of serious economic hardship and deflation , Morton favored a bill that would have added more paper currency to the money supply . He began his second term by leading the Senate 's support for an inflation bill that President Grant vetoed . Morton 's action was politically astute . In Indiana the demands for easy money topped the Democrats ' list of priority issues , and in the fall of 1874 , they carried the state 's elections largely on that basis . However , within a year , Morton joined other Republicans in supporting the Specie Payment Resumption Act , which effectively suspended new currency issues and gave the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury the authority to withdraw currency from circulation . In 1876 Morton was a contender for the Republican nomination for president at the party 's National Convention in Cincinnati , Ohio . Richard W. Thompson offered Morton 's name to the delegation at a nominee , but Morton 's position on issuing paper money to inflate the currency , combined with his failing health , hurt his bid for the nomination among the convention delegates . However , neither of these issues made as much difference as Morton 's association with the deeply discredited and scandal-ridden Grant administration . Morton 's nomination would have made the Republicans vulnerable on both the Reconstruction and corruption issues . In addition , Grant 's supporters had an alternative choice in U.S. Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York . Between the two nominees , the \" stalwart \" Republican bloc was divided , with no prospect of coming together because Conkling and Morton detested one another . When the balloting began , Morton 's vote total placed him second to James G. Blaine , but Morton had slipped to fourth place by the sixth ballot . Blaine 's opponents could only stop Morton 's nomination by uniting behind a candidate acceptable to reform-minded delegates and the stalwart bloc . On the seventh ballot nearly all the anti-Blaine delegates , including Morton 's , united to give Rutherford B. Hayes the Republican nomination . Morton ranked as one of the strongest members of the so-called \" stalwart \" faction of the Republican party : those members most deeply committed to protecting and preserving Republican governments in the South . Not surprisingly , during the winter of 1876-77 , Morton was among the most aggressive supporters of Hayes 's right to the presidency in a close election . When Morton was placed on the Electoral Commission , the group that determined the outcome of the election , there was never any doubt that his vote would be cast for Hayes . After Hayes 's supporters made overtures to southern Democrats , offering assurances that the president-elect would take no active role in propping up Republican governors in Louisiana and South Carolina , there were fears that Morton might cause difficulties . In one speech Morton made it clear that the Democrats must make guarantees of fair play and equal rights for southern blacks , before he would support Hayes 's program . The guarantees were given , or at least promises were made . To the general surprise of many , Hayes 's policy withdrew military support from the Republican governments in those two states , and Morton proved to be one of the president 's strongest defenders , urging that his fellow Republicans show patience and give the so-called \" New Departure \" time to prove itself . = = = Death = = = In 1877 Morton was named to lead a committee to investigate charges of bribery made against La Fayette Grover , a newly elected U.S. Senator from Oregon . The committee spent eighteen days in Oregon holding hearings and investigations . On the return trip , Morton detoured to San Francisco for a rest and visit . After dinner on the night of August 6 , Morton suffered a severe stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body . The next day he was taken by train to Cheyenne , Wyoming Territory , where he was met by his brother-in-law , John A. Burbank , the former governor of the Dakota Territory . Morton was accompanied by him to the home of his mother-in-law in Richmond , Indiana , where he stayed until October 15 , then he was moved to his own home in Indianapolis to recover . He remained at Indianapolis , surrounded by his family , until his death on November 1 , 1877 . Morton 's remains were laid in state at the Indiana Statehouse , before their removal to Indianapolis 's Roberts Park Methodist Church , where his funeral service was held . The service was attended by many dignitaries from across the United States , and President Hayes ordered all flags to half-staff . Because the church could not hold the large crowd , thousands of mourners waited outside and followed in a long procession to witness the burial at Indianapolis 's Crown Hill Cemetery . = = Legacy = = Morton remains \" the most powerful , important , and controversial governor in Indiana history . \" To his admirers and supporters , Morton was a decisive , effective , ambitious , and energetic leader as governor of Indiana during the Civil War ; his detractors would describe him as a wily and power-hungry politician , who shifted his stance on issues to suit prevailing views for his own political gain . Although his tactics were controversial , and on occasion unconstitutional , he remained a dominant political figure from 1861 to 1877 . As one of Lincoln 's \" war governors \" , Morton was most successful in recruiting and equipping Union troops during the Civil War , and became known as \" the soldier 's friend \" , in tribute to his crucial efforts in supplying and supporting the Union soldiers in the field . Morton was also known for standing firm against his political opponents , whom he often antagonized by his ruthlessness , and they frequently responded with severe criticism of his actions . = = = Policies and criticism = = = Morton had many critics during his long tenure in government service . They derided the manner in which he ran Indiana 's state government during the Civil War and criticized his open suppression of the freedom of speech , arrests and detentions of his political opponents , and violations of the state and federal constitutions on more than one occasion . Morton justified his forceful actions as \" a necessary wartime measure \" to protect Indiana and defend the Union . In the U.S. Senate he became one of the foremost defenders of Republican governments in the southern states . Recent historiography of Reconstruction has found Morton among the most consistent supporters of the cause of equal justice under the law . Morton was a formidable personality , detested by his enemies , and vilified in opposition newspapers . According to one account , Morton had no leavening wit , no humor , no breadth of intellect , no sparkle of conversation , to attract those who disagreed with him politically . Another Republican was said to have declared , \" His presence is a deadly poison \" and \" He is a sphinx ; and I am repressed into dumbness when trying to hold a conversation with that man . \" According to a southern newspaper that opposed his actions , Morton was \" a vice-reeking Hoosier bundle of moral and physical rottenness , leprous ulcers and caustic bandages , who loads down with plagues and pollutions the wings of every breeze that sweeps across his loathsome putrefying carcass . \" Other critics and political opponents called him a tyrant and a bully , highlighting his ruthlessness in denouncing , even defaming his enemies , and spreading rumors that he had been a shameless womanizer , forcing himself on every female applicant for favor at the governor 's mansion . One Democratic journalist wrote , \" There is not , probably , in this country , a more conscienceless , corrupt , and utterly profligate man in public life than Morton \" and \" He is rotten physically , morally and politically . \" It was even alleged that his paralysis came from some unspeakable social disease , brought on by his habits . When the Senator declared himself in favor of woman suffrage , the Saint Paul Pioneer was not surprised . \" Why shouldn 't Morton espouse the woman 's cause ? \" it asked . \" It is woman that has made him what he is -- so the gossips say . \" None of his critics could make charges of corruption stick . Senator Morton was among the earliest to refuse any share in the so-called \" back pay \" that Congress awarded its members in 1873 , and returned his money to the U.S. Treasury as soon as it was given to him . Morton was untouched by the Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal . A hostile Democratic House scoured the official files for some evidence of bribe-taking or shakedowns in awarding Civil War contracts , and came up empty-handed . For others , despite holding many positions that angered his opponents , Morton was highly regarded for remaining clean of graft during the war period when corruption was commonplace . For his honest conduct he was offered the thanks of the Indiana General Assembly and others on numerous occasions . After Morton learned that President Grant had nominated his son , John M. Morton , for Registrar of the Land Office in Dakota Territory , the Senator immediately wrote to ask that the selection be withdrawn , protest that he could not afford to have any relative appointed to any political office . After the poor decision-making of Senators Jesse D. Bright and Graham N. Fitch , Morton succeeded in raising Indiana to national prominence during his lifetime . The state and its citizens were once the common subject of jokes to the eastern states , but much of that ceased after the Civil War . = = = Memorials = = = Morton is memorialized in the United States Capitol as one of Indiana 's two statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection . A statue of Governor Morton serves as the Indiana State Memorial at Vicksburg National Military Park in Vicksburg , Mississippi , in honor of his role as a powerful wartime governor . There are two statues of Morton in downtown Indianapolis . A statue on the east side of the Indiana Statehouse , facing Capitol Avenue , by sculptor Rudolf Schwarz was dedicated in 1907 . The other statue , created by sculptor Frank Simmons , was installed in 1864 on Monument Circle , when it served as a city park , and was moved to its new location to become part of the Circle 's Indiana Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Monument around 1899 . A statue of Morton stands on the second floor of the Wayne County Courthouse in Richmond , Indiana , where a previous high school was named for him ; the central section of the current high school is named Morton Hall in his honor . Morton Senior High School in Hammond , Indiana , home of the Morton Governors , is named after him . The annual yearbook of Centerville Senior High School in Centerville , Indiana , is called The Mortonian in honor of Gov. Morton . Morton County , Kansas , and Morton County , North Dakota , are named in his honor . The Oliver P. Morton House at Centerville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 .",

The regiment was organized in New York City in May 1861 as a Zouave regiment , known for its unusual dress and drill style , by Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth , a personal friend of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln . Drawn from the ranks of the city 's many volunteer fire companies , the unit was known alternately as the Ellsworth Zouaves , First Fire Zouaves , First Regiment New York Zouaves , and U.S. National Guards . The unit was among the first to occupy the territory of a Confederate state when it captured Alexandria , Virginia on May 24 , 1861 , less than 24 hours after the Commonwealth seceded from the Union . The regiment suffered extensive casualties during the First Battle of Bull Run during the fighting on Henry House Hill and while serving as the rear guard for the retreating Union Army . The regiment would later be stationed near Hampton Roads during the Peninsula Campaign , but experienced little fighting . Sent back to New York City in May 1862 , the regiment was mustered out of service on June 2 , 1862 . There were several attempts to reorganize as a light infantry regiment through the summer of 1863 , and many new enlistees were involved in suppressing the New York Draft Riots but those efforts failed and the enlistees were transferred to the 17th New York Veteran Volunteer Infantry Regiment . = = Organization and muster = = On April 15 , 1861 , President Lincoln issued an Executive Order calling for 75,000 ninety-day enlistments to \u201c repossess the forts , places , and property which have been seized from the Union . \u2019 \u2019 That day , Lincoln wrote Ellsworth asking for his assistance in raising a regiment . Ellsworth had known the president well , from having assisted in organizing his campaign for the presidency in 1860 and received a commission to organize the 11th New York Infantry as a 90-day regiment . To the enlistees , a common yet often unknown stipulation included 90 days of service to the Federal government and up to two years of service to the state . This was not always communicated to the men who enlisted , including those of the 11th New York . Ellsworth 's military knowledge came from a lifetime of studying military tactics , history , and manuals ; and later as colonel of Chicago 's National Guard Cadets . He never achieved his dream of attending West Point , as he could not gain the needed sponsorship . He was introduced to the famous French Zouaves through the teachings of his fencing instructor , Charles DeVillers , a former French Zouave . Ellsworth introduced this drill team to the flashy Zouave uniforms and drill that emulated French colonial troops in Algeria and turned the group , renamed the U.S. Zouave Cadets , into a national champion drill team . A national tour in 1860 brought Ellsworth to the attention of Abraham Lincoln , for whom the unit performed hundreds of military drill movements with their muskets and bayonets . When a civil war seemed unavoidable , Ellsworth proceeded to New York City to recruit his own regiment from the city 's volunteer fire companies , stating : \" I want the New York Firemen , for there are no more effective men in the country , and none with whom I can do so much . They are sleeping on a volcano at Washington and I want men who can go into a fight now . \" Two days after his arrival , Ellsworth awarded officer commissions to several foremen of the volunteer fire companies and began recruiting in earnest . Within four days , 2,300 men had answered Ellsworth 's call . A selection of only the most desirable men cut that number to 1,100 , which was considered a regiment 's full strength . When the state could not afford to supply the new troops , fundraisers were successful in raising $ 60,000 for the regiment , enough to provide uniforms , several different models of Sharps rifles , and provisions . News media covered the regiment 's formation : More work has been done in six days than seemed possible . The men have been mustered into service ; the officers elected ; the uniforms made , and on Sunday afternoon eleven hundred as efficient and hardy soldiers as ever handled a gun , will start for the scene of rebellion . Col. Ellsworth arrived in this city on Thursday of last week . On Friday he called together a number of the principal men of the department . On Saturday he selected his officers . On Sunday he mustered one thousand men . On Monday he drilled them . Like most Zouave regiments , the men of the 11th New York were fashioned in uniforms not typical of the standard ensemble of a Union soldier . During their service , the 11th New York wore two different style of uniforms , the first issued during the forming of the regiment and the second shortly before the Battle of Bull Run . The initial uniforms were purchased with funds donated by the Union Defense Committee . They were based on Ellsworth 's own design . The consisted of light gray jackets of a chasseur style , with dark blue and red trim along with gray trousers of a jeanscloth material with a blue stripe running down the seam , and tan leather leggings . Along with their gray uniforms , they wore red kepis with a blue band and also received a red fez with a blue tassel , military-issue shirt and / or overshirts . Many Zouaves went off to war wearing the fire badge of their respective fire company . Contrary to modern art prints , the Fire Zouaves did not go off to war wearing fireman 's belts or paint mottos on their fezzes . The second uniform was issued when the first , not made of quality materials , fell apart on most men . This uniform was issued by the federal government , and to the disgust of the men , was not of the true Zouave style , but an American Zouave style . The new uniform had a dark blue Zouave jacket with red cuffs and red trimming with sky blue trimming inside the red . Blue fezzes with blue tassels were issued to provide greater flair to the uniform , as well as dark blue sashes , an issue of red overshirts ( not firemen 's shirts ) , and dark blue trousers . Before the First Battle of Bull Run , most of the Zouaves left their jackets in camp due to the July heat , however , they all retained their blue and red fezzes , and their red blue banded kepis . A number of havelocks were also issued to the regiment . Before the regiment departed from New York City on April 29 , 1861 , its members were reviewed by General John Adams Dix , Ambassador Cassius Marcellus Clay of Kentucky , as well as other notable members of the city and its fire department . Soon after , they marched through the streets escorted by 5,000 firemen . Along the way , they received from the fire department a large white flag measuring 68 inches ( 1.7 m ) by 54 inches ( 1.4 m ) to serve as the regimental colors . The wife of John Jacob Astor II also presented the unit with a flag . Unbeknownst to the regiment , Washington D.C. had postponed their departure because they did not comply with army regulations . John E. Wool , commander of the Department of the East , knew of the postponement , but allowed the men to disembark , unaware the steamer Baltic carried no provisions . Quartermaster Arthur quickly purchased five-day rations , by paying a higher price , and hired three tug boats to catch the steamer to deliver them . The Baltic arrived in Annapolis , Maryland where the men boarded a train to Washington , D.C .. In Washington , men in the regiment broke into taverns , frightened women , swedged on meals and pursued imagined Confederates . They were returned to New York City and quartered in Battery Park . Their public antics and insubordination continued . Arthur had arrested any Fire Zouave found on the streets and jailed them on a steamer . When the number jailed reached 400 the steamer embarked to Hampton Roads where the men were banded with another regiment . = = Early action = = The regiment arrived in Washington , D.C. , on the evening of May 2 . There , they completed additional training and performed picket duty throughout the district . While quartered on the floor of the United States House of Representatives , the enlisted men took it upon themselves to set up a mock session , passing a law first abolishing the House of Representatives , then the Union and reconstituting both in a manner of their liking . The more embarrassing and lawbreaking actions by the regiment included the burning of fences , which resulted in a letter of reprimand from Brigadier General Joseph K. Mansfield along with six enlisted men being removed and sent back to New York . On May 7 , the 11th New York was officially sworn into Federal service by Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell on the East Front of the unfinished Capitol in the presence of Lincoln , his son Tad and personal secretary John Hay . On May 9 , the regiment had an opportunity to apply their experience as firefighters when asked to help extinguish a blaze at the Willard Hotel . Upon receiving word from General Mansfield , commander of the Department of Washington , Ellsworth dispatched ten men from each company to attend to the fire . Soon however , the entire regiment responded to the blaze . With Ellsworth having more men on the scene than the Washington Fire Department , he claimed the fire chief 's trumpet and assumed command of the incident . When the fire was extinguished , Henry Willard , owner of the hotel , invited the regiment to breakfast and money was collected providing them with $ 500 . After nine days quartered at the capitol , the men of the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln . This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary . While just five miles ( 8 km ) from the capitol , the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically , as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak , dry bread , and coffee . Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they had not had butter in a week . When the Commonwealth of Virginia seceded from the Union on May 23 , the regiment was ordered to assist in the occupation of Arlington Heights and Alexandria , Virginia , directly across the Potomac River from Washington . On May 24 , the regiment boarded the steamers Baltimore and Mount Vernon and was transported across the Potomac , landing at the Alexandria wharves under the guard of the gunboat Pawnee . The 11th New York was one of eight to enter Virginia , and Ellsworth 's men met no resistance as they moved through the streets . After landing , members of Company E under Captain Leveridge were sent to take the railroad station , while Ellsworth , Major Charles Loeser , Lieutenant H. J. Winser and several men from Company A set out to secure the telegraph office . On the way there , Ellsworth spotted a Confederate flag atop the Marshall House inn . It was the same flag Ellsworth had seen for weeks from the White House during his visits with Lincoln . Ellsworth 's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag , but they encountered the proprietor , James Jackson , as they descended the stairs . Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest , and Cpl. Francis Brownell responded in kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper . After the death of Ellsworth , Noah L. Farnham , the regiment 's lieutenant colonel , was the obvious choice to take command . He was reluctant , however , labeling it an \" unwelcome responsibility \" . His appointment was graded as temporary , he was not commissioned as the regiment 's colonel and remained at rank while in its command . Regardless , he was a popular choice both with the enlisted men and in New York . One enlisted wrote in a letter home , \" We have great faith in Colonel Farnham , having known him long and intimately as one deserving the confidence and esteem of his associates , and fully deserving of the position that he now occupies . \" Several of the officers recruited by Ellsworth , however , did not approve and caused a small controversy by resigning their commissions . The regiment remained on guard duty in and around Alexandria until July 15 , 1861 , when orders were received attaching the regiment to Orlando B. Willcox 's brigade , of Samuel P. Heintzelman 's division , in Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell 's Army of Northeast Virginia . They were to march out the next morning . From July 16 to 21 , the regiment advanced to intercept Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard 's Confederate Army of the Potomac . Three of McDowell 's five divisions advanced towards Bull Run , outside the railroad junction at Manassas , Virginia . The 11th New York expected to first engage Confederates at Fairfax Court House on July 17 , only to find that they had pulled back towards Centreville , leaving Quaker Guns in their place . These movements were to precipitate the first large-scale battle of the Civil War . = = First Bull Run = = The Zouaves ' first major combat experience occurred during the First Battle of Bull Run . On the morning of July 21 , Farnham 's men were awoken at 2 : 00 a.m. to begin their march to intercept the Confederate army . McDowell 's plan for the day was for divisions under Colonel Daniel Tyler and Brig. Gen. Heintzelman to cross Bull Run at Sudley Ford , expected to be only several miles north of their camp . Poor scouting by Union chief engineer John G. Barnard resulted in a 14-mile ( 23 km ) march for men entering battle that morning . During the march , lead units engaged skirmishers east of Sudley 's Ford with artillery in the early dawn . McDowell had divided his three divisions , sending Heintzelman to the north , sweeping down to cover the Union right , and thus his was the last division to engage . The other two divisions , under Tyler and David Hunter , engaged first on the Union left and center , at Matthews Hill . With those divisions facing heavy resistance , Heintzelman 's division with the 11th New York was called forward at the double-quick . One observer commented that the 11th New York looked more like firemen randomly running to a fire than soldiers marching towards the front . As the fight moved from Matthews Hill to Henry House Hill , the 11th New York fought beside the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment and a battalion of US Marines . These units were ordered to support two batteries of cannon on the Federal right flank led by Captains Charles Griffin and James B. Ricketts . The 11th New York and 1st Minnesota were directed into position at the top of Henry House Hill by Major William Farquhar Barry , McDowell 's chief of artillery , and ordered to assault the Confederate line . On the initial confrontation with the 33rd Virginia Infantry on the left of Confederate General Thomas J. \" Stonewall \" Jackson 's line , both the Union and Confederate forces were initially confused because the some of 11th New York were wearing several colors of shirts and the Virginians were clad in dark blue frock coats and dark blue trousers . The Virginians fired a volley that took down several men and the Zouaves and Marines broke and ran , but a few of the men remained . As the 11th New York and 1st Minnesota were regrouping along the Manassas-Sudley Road , they were encountered by Confederate Colonel J. E. B. Stuart and his 150 cavalrymen . Stuart mistook the New Yorkers for retreating Confederates in the smoke and quickly rode forward , shouting , \u201c Don \u2019 t run , boys ; we are here . \u201d But after seeing a color bearer passing with the United States flag , he realized his mistake . Stuart ordered a small band of \" Black Horse \" cavalry , led by R. Welby Carter and the men of his Loudoun Company , to charge from the right and strike the 11th 's rear guard . The 11th New York saw them coming and shifted formations to meet Carter 's men . The 11th 's volleys quickly killed eight of the riders and wounded nine with the rest escaping back into the woods ; the charge had little effect on the organization of Fire Zouaves . While repulsing the cavalry charge , Colonel Farnham was wounded , but remained on the field aided by Lt. Colonel John Cregier and Major Loeser . By 2 : 00 p.m. , the 11th New York and 1st Minnesota were joined by the 14th Brooklyn Regiment and again took their place behind the Union guns . However , soon confusion again erupted on the battlefield in front of them . As the gunners confronted the blue-clad 33rd Virginia , Major Barry ordered Ricketts to hold his fire , allowing the Virginians to charge the batteries and capture the guns . While the 14th Brooklyn was able to quickly retake the guns , the Union regiments supporting the cannon were unable to withstand the near constant barrage from Confederate artillery and infantry and fell back again to the Manassas-Sudley Road . The 11th New York , the Irish 69th New York Militia and 14th Brooklyn would charge Henry Hill four times , first in an effort to retake Ricketts ' and Griffin 's cannon , but each attempt failed . In the wild melee , the 69th 's color bearers were killed and its colors lost , but an officer of the 11th , Captain John Wildey , was able to recapture the Irish color , and then handed it back to the grateful Irishmen . When the order to withdraw from the field came later that evening from General McDowell , the 11th New York served as a rearguard . It was during this retreat that the regiment saw its heaviest casualties . Although accounts of the battle differ , most sources list 177 men lost at Bull Run , with 35 men killed , 74 wounded , and another 68 missing and presumed captured . Those that were taken prisoner were initially confined in Richmond . In September , they were transferred to Castle Pinckney , South Carolina , where they remained until they were paroled the following May . = = After Bull Run = = On August 12 , 1861 , the remaining members of the regiment were sent back to New York City to disband , in preparation to reorganize , obtain equipment and replacements . On September 14 , 1861 , after reorganizing , they were ordered by Governor Edwin D. Morgan , at the request of Secretary of War Simon Cameron , to return to Virginia with two days ' cooked rations . They were to be encamped at Fort Monroe on the tip of the Virginia Peninsula . Morgan must not have been quick to follow up with Cameron , as two days later Cameron sent him a cable pleading for an update , asking , \" Did you send the Fire Zouaves to Fort Monroe , as indicated in your message of the 14th ? \" An entry from January 31 , 1862 , of the Official Records places the 11th New York as a unit of the Department of Virginia at Camp Butler under the command of Brig. Gen. Joseph Mansfield . On March 8 , 1862 , they watched from shore as the USS Monitor and CSS Virginia dueled off the coast of Hampton Roads . Two members of the regiment were detailed to the nearby USS Cumberland and manned its cannons until they were forced to abandon ship . With manpower further depleted as a result of injury and disease , the regiment was returned to New York City on May 7 . There , it was mustered out of service on June 2 , 1862 . = = Draft Riots and disbanding = = On May 18 , 1863 , Colonel James C. Burke received authority to reorganize the original regiment as a three-years regiment to be known as the J. T. Brady Light Infantry . Burke was required to raise 250 men for the effort but failed . His authorization was revoked on June 7 and transferred to Colonel Henry F. O 'Brien . O 'Brien was required to raise 250 men by August 1 , 250 others by September 1 , and an additional 250 men by November 1 . These recruiting efforts were hampered by the draft riot in New York City of July 1863 . As the 11th New York Regiment had experienced first hand , the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 had taken a heavy toll on Union forces , including those from New York City . As the war dragged on , a military manpower shortage occurred in the Union and Congress passed the first conscription act in United States history on March 3 , 1863 , authorizing the President to draft male citizens between the ages of 18 and 35 for a three-year term of military service . Initially intended to express anger at the draft , the protests deteriorated into \" a virtual racial pogrom , with uncounted numbers of blacks murdered on the streets \" . The conditions in the city were such that Major General John E. Wool stated on July 16 , \" Martial law ought to be proclaimed , but I have not a sufficient force to enforce it \" . States ' militias and Federal troops attached to the Army of the Potomac , including the newly reorganized 11th New York , were dispatched to quell the riots . Other regiments utilized included the 152nd New York , the 26th Michigan , the 27th Indiana and the 7th Regiment New York State Militia , which arrived from Frederick , Maryland after a forced march . In addition , New York governor Horatio Seymour sent the 74th and 65th regiments of the New York state militia , which had not been federalized , and a section of the 20th Artillery from Fort Schuyler in Throgs Neck . At the height of the violence , Colonel O 'Brien , the 11th Regiment 's commanding officer , was seized by the mob , beaten , and killed . In the wake of the riots , the reorganization produced few recruits and stalled . On October 1 , 1863 , the reorganization was discontinued and the men who had enlisted were transferred to the 17th Veteran Infantry Regiment . = = Aftermath and legacy = = During its limited but intense combat experience , the regiment saw 51 members killed , including three officers and 48 enlisted men . Among these was the regiment 's first commander , Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth , who was the first conspicuous casualty of the Civil War . Private Francis E. Brownell became the first soldier in the Civil War to be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in killing Col. Ellsworth 's murderer . Following Ellsworth 's death , Remember Ellsworth ! and Avenge Ellsworth became Union rallying cries . The 44th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment was raised by the People 's Ellsworth Committee and were known as the \" People 's Ellsworth Regiment \" , or more commonly \" Ellsworth 's Avengers \" , under the command of Stephen W. Stryker , a former lieutenant in the 11th New York . Apart from those who died of battle wounds , three officers and 12 enlisted men succumbed to disease , including its second colonel , Noah Farnham , who died as a result of his wounds sustained at Bull Run and a bout of typhoid . A total of 66 men of the 11th New York Infantry Regiment died in the course of the war . In 1903 , the flag for which Ellsworth gave his life , taken down from the top of Marshal House , was presented to the War Department by its custodian , the Ellsworth Post , Grand Army of the Republic . The flag had been carried by the regiment throughout the war and afterward maintained at their post headquarters . It was added to the war flag collection in Cullum Memorial Hall at West Point . Historian David Detzer has argued that the fame that surrounds the 11th New York is misplaced . During its time in service , the 11th New York Regiment saw little fighting compared to other well-known regiments such as the 69th New York , 20th Maine , and 28th Massachusetts . The 11th New York was often overshadowed by the 73rd New York , also known as the Second Fire Zouaves , which fought at Antietam , Gettysburg , and Appomattox . In addition , Ellsworth failed to consider that the New York City fire companies from which his troops were drawn often competed against each other at blazes . The cohesion he sought in firefighters did not exist and would not be created when they joined the regiment . In that respect , 11th New York was no different than many regiments , North and South . = = Gallery = =",

Montana studied at the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in Manhattan , New York City , New York . Montana 's monuments were well-known , particularly in New York , and included an earlier \" Doughboy \" sculpture erected in 1920 to honor the war dead of the Bushwick , Brooklyn and Ridgewood , Queens . The success of this the earlier \" Fighting Doughboy \" memorial resulted in the production of three copies by 1921 . By 1932 , he had produced over 40 statues and won a gold medal from the National Academy of Design for \" Orphans \" in 1931 . For the design of the sculpture , Montana modeled Charles Atlas and \" strove to communicate the U.S. doughboy 's upstanding character and valor by way of a muscle-bound physique \" . In 1926 , the East Providence Memorial Committee expressed concerns that Montana 's design was \" too brutal \" and modified the original design provided by Montana . The statue was erected in 1927 , and formally dedicated on July 30 , 1927 . At the dedication , Major General Charles Pelot Summerall gave an address which highlighted the handicap placed upon the soldiers by a lack of preparedness and \" invoked the fighting ideal embodied by Montana 's doughboy . \" The sculpture of a soldier stands 7.75 feet ( 2.36 m ) tall , 2.583 feet ( 0.787 m ) wide and 2.66 feet ( 0.81 m ) deep .

The corners of the base have small leaf designed and has 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) by 2.66 feet ( 0.81 m ) bronze reliefs with arched tops on each side . The front relief states that it was erected in the memory of the citizens of East Providence who served in World War I from 1917 to 1918 , and lists the names of twenty three soldiers . The left relief depicts a marching infantry column of one man on horseback and four on foot , the right relief depicts four or five men loading a cannon and the rear relief depicts a nurse assisting two wounded soldiers . At the time of its nomination , the sculpture was described as in \" moderately good condition \" , with the surface being both stained and pitted , but free or breaks or missing pieces .

                    "text": "Australian Army during World War II = The Australian Army was the largest service in the Australian military during World War II . Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army was split into the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Following the outbreak of war , on 14 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force ( Second AIF ) , would be formed for overseas service . Meanwhile , conscription was introduced in October 1939 to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . The Australian Army subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 . Following the Japanese surrender Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces across the South West Pacific . Meanwhile , the Army contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan from 1946 . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions , and in August 1942 the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force was larger than Australia 's population and economy could sustain , and its strength was reduced in the second half of the year . Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed , but few did so . The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943 . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 . These units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles . This organisation proved only moderately successful , and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns . The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947 . A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war , a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population . Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . As a proportion of its population , the Australian Army was ultimately one of the largest Allied armies during World War II . Casualties included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 who died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . Another 5,558 were killed or died as prisoners of war ( POWs ) , while non-battle casualties in operational areas were also significant and included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded or injured . In addition , the Army suffered a substantial number of casualties in non-operational areas : 1,795 soldiers killed and 121,800 wounded or injured . = = Background = = Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army consisted of the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Throughout the inter-war years , a combination of complacency and economic austerity had resulted in limited defence spending . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , conscription was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Militia would be maintained on a part-time , voluntary basis only . The size of the Army remained small up until 1938 and 1939 when the Militia was rapidly expanded as the threat of war grew . In 1938 , there had been only 35,000 soldiers in the Militia , but by September 1939 this had been increased to 80,000 , supported by a PMF of 2,800 full-time soldiers whose main responsibility was largely to administer and train the Militia . This expansion had little impact on improving the readiness of Australian forces upon the outbreak of the war , though , as the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 restricted the pre-war Army to service in Australia and its territories including Papua and New Guinea . As a result , when Australia entered the war in 1939 , a new all-volunteer force was required that could fight in Europe or elsewhere outside of Australia 's immediate region . ( Similarly , in World War I the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force ( First AIF ) was raised and served with distinction at Gallipoli , in the Middle East and on the Western Front . ) From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by the \" Singapore strategy \" , which centred on the establishment of a major naval base at Singapore and the use of naval forces to respond to any future Japanese aggression in the region . As a maritime strategy , it resulted in a defence budget that was focused on building up the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , in order to support the British Royal Navy . Between 1923 and 1929 , \u00a3 20,000,000 was spent on the RAN , while the Australian Army and the munitions industry received only \u00a3 10,000,000 and the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) just \u00a3 2,400,000 . The strategy met significant political opposition from sections of the regular Army , including several prominent officers such as Henry Wynter and John Lavarack . Wynter in particular argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe and would be unable to send sufficient resources to Singapore . He contended that Singapore was vulnerable , especially to attack from the land and the air , and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN . During the 1930s the Australian Army 's organisation , equipment and doctrine were similar to those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports . While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan , little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia 's eastern seaboard , along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia . The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s , but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations due to a lack of resources as a result of limited defence expenditures . Nevertheless , the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war , and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service . In 1942 the Army adopted the title Australian Military Forces ( AMF ) to encompass the various categories of service : AIF , Militia and Permanent Forces . Wartime exigencies required a rapid expansion of the Army and during the war 730,000 personnel enlisted in either the Militia or the AIF , a figure which represented around 10 percent of Australia 's population of just seven million , one of the highest percentages of any of the Allied armies during World War II . It subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 as part of British Commonwealth forces , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 primarily in conjunction with forces from the United States . Nearly 400,000 men served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . = = Organisation = = = = = Origin of the Second Australian Imperial Force = = = Australia entered World War II on 3 September 1939 . On 14 September Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force , would be formed for overseas service . Like its predecessor , the Second AIF was a volunteer force formed by establishing entirely new units . In many cases these units drew their recruits from the same geographical areas as First AIF units , and they were given the same numerical designations albeit with the prefix \" 2 / \" . In October 1939 , conscription was introduced to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . From January 1940 , all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service . While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military , the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service . A side effect of this arrangement was the creation of two different armies with different conditions of service , one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF . This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war , as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces . Later , provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service . This required 65 percent of a unit 's war establishment \u2014 or 75 percent of its actual strength \u2014 to volunteer and allowed whole battalions to become part of the AIF . An early problem was whether to adopt the British or Australian organisation . In 1939 the British Army was in the process of re-equipping with new weapons , and a new organisation was required . This new equipment was not available in Australia , so it was decided to organise the first unit to be raised \u2014 the 6th Division \u2014 with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new . Consequently , the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel , and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies , a battalion headquarters , regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals , mortars , carriers , pioneers , anti-aircraft and administration . Artillery support was provided by three field regiments , each attached at brigade-level , as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles . Corps troops included a machine-gun battalion , and various engineer , logistics and communication units . Three further AIF infantry divisions were formed during 1940 : the 7th Division in February 1940 , the 8th Division in May and the 9th Division in June . However , the establishment of these divisions was reduced to the new nine-battalion organisation as the size of an Australian division was reduced to approximately 17,000 men , and the three surplus battalions of the 6th Division became part of the 7th Division . Further changes included the addition of a light anti-aircraft regiment at divisional level , and a reorganisation of the divisional artillery from three four-battery regiments consisting of 16 guns to three two-battery regiments of 12 guns . An AIF corps headquarters , designated I Corps , was formed in March 1940 along with various support units . The 1st Armoured Division , the final AIF division to be formed , was established in July 1941 , built around a core of two armoured brigades each consisting of three tank-equipped armoured regiments , supported by motorised cavalry , armoured cars , engineers and artillery . Several units , such as Z and M Special Units , were also raised for irregular warfare as were 12 commando companies . Many corps , support and service units were also raised during the war to provide combat and logistical support . = = = Forces in Australia and the Pacific = = = The Army 's command and administrative arrangements at the start of the war were based on a system of military districts that had existed since Federation , albeit with a number of modifications . Australia was divided into six military districts each of which largely equated to a State or Territory , and reported to the Department of the Chief of the General Staff . Meanwhile , the Military Board was responsible for the administration of the Army , with regular members consisting of the Deputy Adjutant-General , the Chief of Intelligence , the Chief of the General Staff , the Chief of Ordnance and a civilian Finance Member , in addition to a number of consultative members , under the overall control of the Minister of the Defence . The 1st Military District ( 1 MD ) encompassed Queensland , the 2nd included most of New South Wales , the 3rd was primarily based on Victoria , the 4th included South Australia , the 5th included Western Australia and the 6th encompassed forces in Tasmania . In 1939 the Northern Territory was designated the 7th Military District , while and the 8th Military District was later activated in Port Moresby to command forces in New Guinea . Following the outbreak of World War II a regional command structure was subsequently adopted , with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command , 5 MD redesignated Western Command , while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales , Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command . In the early years of the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas ; however , as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure . The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan 's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation . In response , the Army command structure was reorganised in early 1942 . While Western Australia remained unchanged , Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas , 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force . In July 1942 the Military Board 's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces , General Sir Thomas Blamey . The AIF 's requirements for manpower and equipment constrained the Militia during the early years of the war . At the outbreak of the Pacific War the main Army units in Australia were five Militia infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th Divisions \u2014 two Militia cavalry divisions \u2014 the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions \u2014 and the AIF 1st Armoured Division . The Volunteer Defence Corps ( VDC ) , which was a part-time volunteer force of 100,000 men based on the British Home Guard , was also available for local defence . In addition , by early 1942 there were 12,000 garrison force personnel \u2014 mostly reservist veterans of World War I \u2014 organised into 13 garrison battalions for coastal defence and five battalions and two companies for internal security tasks , including guarding prisoner of war camps . Yet at this time only 30 percent of Militia units were on full-time duty , with the remainder periodically undertaking three month-long mobilisations . The Militia was also poorly armed , and there was insufficient equipment to be issued to all units if they were mobilised . In response to the Japanese threat following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the capture of the 8th Division in Malaya , the condition of the Militia became a pressing concern , after largely having been ignored since 1940 . Several middle-ranking and senior officers of the AIF were subsequently posted to Militia units and formations to give them experience . Meanwhile , the Army was forced to move units between Militia divisions so that the most combat-ready could be sent to areas believed to be under the greatest threat of attack . Some battalions were amalgamated , and although some were later separated and reformed , others were disbanded altogether . After the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed Militia units were able to serve outside Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 , though the 11th Brigade was the only major formation to do so . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th , 9th , 10th , 11th and 12th Divisions \u2014 and three armoured divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd and 3rd \u2014 organised into the First and Second Armies , and I , II and III Corps , as well as many support and service units . In August 1942 , the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force proved larger than what Australia 's population and industry could sustain ; by late 1942 the number of personnel who needed to be inducted each month to make good losses caused by sickness and combat was much larger than the numbers who were becoming eligible for service , and the allocation of a high proportion of Australia 's limited supply of manpower to the military was inhibiting the expansion of the munitions industry and other key sectors of the economy . The Army was also unbalanced as a large majority its personnel were employed in arms corps undertaking combat and combat support roles . Heavily reliant upon its allies for logistical support , it required more personnel in support arms such as ordnance and transport to be functional as a self-sufficient organisation . This situation was most acute in 1942 ; at that time there were 137,236 men serving arms corps such as infantry , cavalry and armour , while there were just 29,079 in ordnance . This imbalance was slowly addressed after 1942 as the Army 's size was reduced . Most of the units that were disbanded were Militia arms corps units , and by September 1943 the AIF outnumbered the Militia , having 265,000 members compared to just over 117,000 . Further reductions came in October 1943 when the Army 's strength was further reduced by 100,000 men to free up manpower to work in industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . By 1945 the support arms had grown considerably as a proportion of the total force and by August 1945 ordnance and the electrical and mechanical engineers totalled 42,835 men , while the artillery had been reduced to half its previous strength . Infantry , cavalry and armoured corps personnel numbered just 62,097 men , while engineers , signals and the medical services remained the same , albeit as part of a much smaller Army . Regardless , at the end of the war it remained one of the largest Allied armies as a proportion of population , being second only to the Soviet Union . The VDC was also reduced in size in May 1944 , and was finally disbanded on 24 August 1945 . If the conflict had continued past August 1945 , the size of the Army would have been further reduced to three divisions once Bougainville , New Guinea and New Britain had been secured . Two of these divisions would have been used on garrison duties , while a brigade group may have been made available for British-led operations in South East Asia and the remaining division was to take part in the invasion of Japan . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed . The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry . These large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 , reducing the authorised strength of the division by about 4,000 men . Each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as the anti-aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level . The amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced , but the conditions that the organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful . As a result , the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns by returning the artillery and anti-tank units that had been removed . The creation of the jungle divisions represented the first time in the Australian Army 's history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for the conditions in which its forces would fight . Previously force structure had been heavily influenced by the British Army , and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence . Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier force structure , as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on the previous scales of equipment and manning . Ultimately , while their structure was better suited to operations in Australia , they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese . As a result , the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised , while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties . The Army also raised many anti-aircraft and coastal defence units during the war . The pre-war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939 , and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea in response to the threat of Japanese attack . Australia had a limited capacity to produce anti-aircraft guns , and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain . As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment . The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944 . The Army had few anti-aircraft guns at the outbreak of war , and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities . By 1942 anti-aircraft batteries were in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia . The expansion of the artillery in general , and coastal defence and anti-aircraft units in particular , meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen . VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and anti-aircraft defences as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded . Traditionally the Australian Army had relied on its major allies to provide logistic support , primarily raising combat units rather than support arms during times of conflict . Consequently , these services were relatively underdeveloped , and they remained so during the first years of the war . While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941 , the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war . As a result , the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic , including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining . These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships , food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas . In addition , with Australia 's national support base located well to the rear , in the major cities in the south-east of the country , significant expansion of the Army 's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea . Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia , while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft . = = = Women 's services = = = Prior to World War II the Australian Army Nursing Service ( AANS ) was the only female branch of the Army . A reserve formation that had served overseas during World War I , the AANS was mobilised following the outbreak of war in 1939 and its Matron in Chief , Grace Wilson , served on the staff of the Director-General of Medical Services , Major General Rupert Downes . For most of the war , AANS nurses were the only Australian servicewomen permitted to serve overseas , and many volunteered for the AIF . These women served in all the major theatres in which the Army fought and a total of 71 were killed on active service . The majority of these died in early 1942 during the fighting in Malaya and Singapore where 41 nurses were killed . In March 1942 , the Volunteer Aid Detachments ( VADs ) also became a branch of the Army Medical Service . Consisting of volunteers originally coordinated by the Australian Red Cross and Order of Saint John , the VADs were redesignated the Australian Army Medical Women 's Service ( AAMWS ) in December 1942 , and were employed in military hospitals in Australia and overseas until after the end of the war , before returning to civilian control in 1948 . Shortages of manpower also led to the establishment of the Australian Women 's Army Service ( AWAS ) in August 1941 . AWAS members filled a wide range of roles to allow the Army to redeploy male soldiers to fighting units . While they mainly worked in clerical and administrative positions , and auxiliary roles such as drivers and signallers , many served in anti-aircraft batteries , operating radars and searchlights but not the guns themselves . While Blamey sought to have members of the AWAS posted overseas from early 1941 onwards , the Australian Government did not agree to this until 1945 . As a result , only about 400 of the 24,000 women who joined the AWAS served outside Australia . The AWAS was reduced in size following the war , and was finally disbanded on 30 June 1947 . Colonel Sybil Irving commanded the AWAS from September 1941 until 1947 . In total some 35,000 women served in the Army , making up about 5 percent of the force . = = Campaigns = = = = = North Africa = = = During the first years of World War II , Australia 's military strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom 's imperial defence policy . The Singapore strategy , which seemingly negated the need for large-scale land forces in the Pacific , was a key component of this policy and consequently most Australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed an integral part of the Commonwealth forces in the area . The three AIF infantry divisions dispatched to the Middle East were subsequently heavily involved in the fighting that followed . In addition to the force which was sent to North Africa , two AIF brigades ( the 18th and 25th ) were stationed in Britain from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings . An Australian Army forestry group also served in Britain between 1940 and 1943 . The Australian Army first saw action in Operation Compass , the successful Commonwealth offensive in North Africa which was conducted between December 1940 and February 1941 . Although the 6th Division was not fully equipped , it had completed its training and on 14 December , it relieved the 4th Indian Division . Given the task of capturing Italian fortresses bypassed by the British 7th Armoured Division during its advance , on 3 January , the division went into action at Bardia . Although the fortress was manned by a larger force , the Australian infantry quickly penetrated the Italian defensive lines with the support of British tanks and artillery . The majority of the defenders surrendered on 5 January and the Australians took 40,000 prisoners . The 6th Division followed up this success by assaulting the fortress of Tobruk on 21 January , securing it the next day and taking 25,000 Italians prisoner . After this , the Australians pushed west along the coast road to Cyrenaica and captured Benghazi on 4 February . Later that month , the 6th Division was withdrawn for deployment to Greece and was replaced by the untested 9th Division , which took up garrison duties in Cyrenaica . In the last week of March 1941 , a German-led force launched an offensive in Cyrenaica . The Allied forces in the area were rapidly forced to withdraw towards Egypt . The 9th Division formed the rear guard of this withdrawal , and on 6 April was ordered to defend the important port town of Tobruk for at least two months . Sustained by the Australian destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet , during the ensuing siege the 9th Division , reinforced by the 7th Division 's 18th Brigade as well as British artillery and armoured regiments , used fortifications , aggressive patrolling and artillery to contain and defeat repeated German armoured and infantry attacks . In September and October 1941 , upon the request of the Australian Government , the 9th Division was relieved and the bulk withdrawn from Tobruk . The 2 / 13th Battalion , however , was forced to remain until the siege was lifted in December as the convoy evacuating it was attacked . The defence of Tobruk cost the Australian units involved 3,009 casualties , including 832 killed and 941 taken prisoner . = = = Greece , Crete and Lebanon = = = In early 1941 the 6th Division and I Corps headquarters took part in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion . The corps ' commander , Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey , and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky , but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat . The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans . Australian troops arrived in Greece during March and manned defensive positions in the north of the country alongside British , New Zealand and Greek units . The outnumbered Allied force was not able to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6 April and was forced to retreat . The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and were evacuated from southern Greece between 24 April and 1 May . Australian warships also formed part of the force which protected the evacuation and embarked hundreds of soldiers from Greek ports . The 6th Division suffered heavy casualties in this campaign , with 320 men killed and 2,030 captured . While most of the 6th Division returned to Egypt , the 19th Brigade Group and two provisional infantry battalions landed at Crete where they formed a key part of the island 's defences . The 19th Brigade was initially successful in holding its positions when German paratroopers landed on 20 May , but was gradually forced to retreat . After several key airfields were lost the Allies evacuated the island 's garrison . Approximately 3,000 Australians , including the entire 2 / 7th Battalion , could not be evacuated , and were taken prisoner . As a result of its heavy casualties the 6th Division required substantial reinforcements and equipment before it was again ready for combat . The 7th Division , reinforced by the 6th Division 's 17th Brigade , formed a key part of the Allied ground forces during the Syria \u2013 Lebanon campaign which was fought against Vichy French forces in June and July 1941 . With close air support from the RAAF and the Royal Air Force , the Australian force entered Lebanon on 8 June and advanced along the coast road and Litani River valley . Although little resistance had been expected , the Vichy forces mounted a strong defence which made good use of the mountainous terrain . After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian I Corps headquarters took command of the operation on 18 June . These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces and the 7th Division entered Beirut on 12 July . The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the Vichy commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13 July . = = = El Alamein = = = In the second half of 1941 the Australian I Corps was concentrated in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East . Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps , including the 6th and 7th Divisions , returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia . The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain 's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73 squadrons . The Government did not intend that the 9th Division would play a major role in active fighting , and it was not sent any further reinforcements . In mid-1942 , the Axis forces defeated the Commonwealth force in Libya and advanced into north-west Egypt . In June the British Eighth Army made a stand just over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) west of Alexandria , at the railway siding of El Alamein and the 9th Division was brought forward to reinforce this position . The lead elements of the division arrived at El Alamein on 6 July and it was assigned the most northerly section of the Commonwealth defensive line . From that position , the 9th Division subsequently played a significant role in the First Battle of El Alamein , helping to halt the Axis advance . Casualties were heavy , and the 2 / 28th Battalion was forced to surrender on 27 July when it was surrounded by German armour after capturing Ruin Ridge . Following this battle the division remained at the northern end of the El Alamein line and launched diversionary attacks during the Battle of Alam el Halfa in early September . In October 1942 , the 9th Division and the RAAF squadrons in the area took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein . After a lengthy period of preparation , the Eighth Army launched its major offensive on 23 October . The 9th Division was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle , and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2nd New Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1 / 2 November . The 9th Division suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces . During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as it was not possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain it , and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November . The 9th Division left Egypt for Australia in January 1943 , ending the AIF 's involvement in the war in North Africa . = = = Malaya and Singapore = = = Due to the emphasis placed on cooperation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940 . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941 , while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island . An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul , and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon . Meanwhile , in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain in order to protect the airfield , while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland , Vila in the New Hebrides , Tulagi on Guadalcanal , Buka Passage in Bougainville , and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers . In December 1941 the Australian Army in the Pacific consisted of the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia , including the 1st Armoured Division . In keeping with the Singapore strategy , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . At the outbreak of war the Australian forces in Malaya consisted of two brigade groups from the 8th Division \u2014 the 22nd and 27th Brigades \u2014 under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett , along with four RAAF squadrons and eight warships . Following the Japanese invasion on 8 December 1941 , the 8th Division and its attached Indian Army units was assigned responsibility for the defence of Johore in the south of Malaya . As a result , it did not see action until mid-January 1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state , having pushed back the British and Indian units defending the northern parts of the peninsula . By this time , the division 's two brigades had been split up , with the 22nd having been deployed around Mersing and Endau on the east coast and the 27th in the west . The division 's first engagement came on the west coast around Muar on 14 January , where the Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian 45th Brigade was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas . While the Commonwealth forces in Johore achieved a number of local tactical victories , most notably around Gemas , Bakri and Jemaluang , they were unable to do more than slow the Japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties in doing so . After being outmanoeuvred by the Japanese , the remaining Commonwealth units withdrew to Singapore on the night of 30 \u2013 31 January . Following this the 8th Division was deployed to defend Singapore 's north-west coast . Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division 's units were at half-strength , and the replacements that had been received \u2014 a draft of about 1,900 replacements was sent in late January \u2014 were barely trained , some having as little as two weeks ' training in Australia before being dispatched . Assigned larger-than-normal frontages to defend along beaches that were ill-suited for defence , the 22nd and 27th Brigades were spread thin on the ground with large gaps in their lines . The commander of the Singapore fortress , Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival , believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector . Nevertheless , on 8 February the Japanese landed in the Australian sector , and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting . A subsequent landing took place at Kranji , but the division was unable to turn this back and subsequently withdrew to the centre of the island . After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore , Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February . Although some Australians were able to escape , following the capitulation 14,972 Australians were taken prisoner . Bennett was among those that managed to get out , having left the island the night before the surrender via sampan after handing over command of his division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan . He later justified his actions saying that he had gained an understanding of how to defeat the Japanese and needed to return to Australia to pass his knowledge on , but two post-war inquiries found that he was unjustified in leaving his command . The loss of almost a quarter of Australia 's overseas soldiers and the failure of the Singapore strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain , stunned the country . The fall of Singapore raised fears of a Japanese invasion of the Australian mainland and the Government became concerned about the Army 's ability to respond . Although large , the forces in Australia contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility . In response , most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Australian Prime Minister , John Curtin , appealed to the United States for assistance . As Japanese forces advanced through Burma towards India in early 1942 , the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions while they were en route to Australia , but Curtin refused to authorise this movement . As a compromise the 16th and 17th Brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island 's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942 . = = = Netherlands East Indies and Rabaul = = = While Australia 's contribution to the pre-war plans to defend South East Asia from Japanese aggression was focused on the defence of Malaya and Singapore , small Australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to the north of Australia . The role of these forces was to defend strategic airfields which could be used to launch attacks on the Australian mainland . Detachments of coastwatchers were also stationed in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands to report on any Japanese operations there . At the start of the Pacific War the strategic port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by \" Lark Force \" , which comprised the 2 / 22nd Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron . While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military , it was not possible to reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942 . The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle . Few members of Lark Force survived the war , as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057 Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan , the transport Montevideo Maru , was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942 . AIF troops were also dispatched from Darwin to the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) in the first weeks of the Pacific War . Reinforced battalions from the 8th Division 's third brigade , the 23rd , were sent to Koepang in West Timor as part of \" Sparrow Force \" and to the island of Ambon as \" Gull Force \" to defend these strategic locations from Japanese attack . The 2 / 2nd Independent Company was also sent to Dili in Portuguese Timor in violation of Portugal 's neutrality . The force at Ambon was defeated by the Japanese landing on 30 January and surrendered on 3 February 1942 . Over 300 Australian prisoners were subsequently killed by Japanese troops in a series of mass executions during February . While the force at Koepang was defeated after the Japanese landed there on 20 February and also surrendered , Australian commandos waged a guerrilla campaign against the Japanese in Portuguese Timor until February 1943 . In the lead-up to the Japanese invasion of Java a force of 242 carrier- and land-based aircraft attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942 . At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI . The Japanese attack was successful , and resulted in the deaths of 251 civilians and military personnel , most of whom were non-Australian Allied seamen , and heavy damage to RAAF Base Darwin and the town 's port facilities . A 3,000-strong Army unit , as well as several Australian warships and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March 1942 . An Army force made up of elements from the 7th Division also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command ( ABDACOM ) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12 March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate . Following the conquest of the NEI , the Japanese Navy 's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean , attacking Ceylon in early April . The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon at the time of the raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate . = = = Defence of Australia = = = Japan 's rapid advance south had been unexpected , and the perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military . By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions , three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units . Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps , which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively . However , Australia 's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed , and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 . Despite Australian fears , the Japanese never intended to invade the Australian mainland . While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942 , it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military 's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken . Instead , in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa and New Caledonia . Yet this plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway . While these battles ended the threat to Australia , the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943 . A series of Japanese air raids against northern Australia occurred during 1942 and 1943 , and while the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters , a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries were also involved in dealing with this threat . Meanwhile , in 1942 the Australian military was reinforced by units recalled from the Middle East and an expansion of the Militia and RAAF . United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea , and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander , General Douglas MacArthur . After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942 , with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943 . From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations , but continued to conduct large-scale operations until the end of the war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time . = = = Papuan campaign = = = Japanese forces first landed on the mainland of New Guinea on 8 March 1942 when they invaded Lae and Salamaua to secure bases for the defence of the important base they were developing at Rabaul . In response , Australian guerrillas from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles established observation posts around the Japanese beachheads and the 2 / 5th Independent Company successfully raided Salamaua on 29 June . After the Battle of the Coral Sea frustrated the Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby via an amphibious landing , they attempted to capture the town by landing Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii 's South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of Papua and advancing overland using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range . The Kokoda Track campaign began on 22 July when the Japanese began their advance , opposed by an ill-prepared Militia brigade designated \" Maroubra Force \" . This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force but was unable to halt it . In late August and early September 1942 Australian forces at Milne Bay inflicted the first notable land defeat of the war upon the Japanese . After the Japanese landed a unit of Special Naval Landing Forces to capture the airbases that the Allies had established in the area , two brigades of Australian troops \u2014 the Militia 7th and AIF 18th \u2014 designated \" Milne Force \" , supported by two RAAF fighter squadrons and US Army engineers , launched a counter-attack . Outnumbered , lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties , the Japanese were forced to withdraw . The victory helped raise Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre , especially on the Kokoda Track where the Japanese had continued to make progress throughout August . On 26 August two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force but the Japanese continued to advance along the Kokoda Track and by 16 September they reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby . After several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses , the Japanese troops were within 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) of Port Moresby . Yet supply problems made any further advance impossible , and the Japanese began to fear an Allied counter-landing at Buna . Following reverses at the hands of US forces on Guadalcanal the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided they could not support fronts on both New Guinea and Guadalcanal . Horii was subsequently ordered to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided . After this , the Australian forces were heavily reinforced by the 7th Division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit , often forcibly , to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel , the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track . In early November , they had been forced into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua . Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 . The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32nd Infantry Division , and was short of artillery and supplies . Due to a lack of supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey 's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications . These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943 . Throughout the fighting in Papua , most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered . In response , for the remainder of the war Australian soldiers generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel and aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents including some that had surrendered . Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea . Meanwhile , during the fighting in 1942 \u2013 43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the Japanese in jungle warfare . The Papuan campaign led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army . During the campaign , the restriction banning Militia personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and Militia . In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943 . This made deploying the Militia easier , but ultimately only one brigade , the 11th , was dispatched outside of Australian territory , being deployed to Merauke on the south coast of Dutch West Papua in the NEI during 1943 and 1944 as part of \" Merauke Force \" . = = = New Guinea offensives = = = After halting the Japanese advance , Allied forces went on the offensive across the SWPA from mid-1943 . Australian forces played a key role throughout this offensive , which was designated Operation Cartwheel . In particular , Blamey oversaw a series of highly successful operations around the north-east tip of New Guinea which \" was the high point of Australia 's experience of operational level command \" during the war . After the successful defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943 . This advance was mounted to divert attention from Lae , which was one of the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel , and proceeded slowly . In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team , which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua . The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943 . In early September 1943 Australian-led forces mounted a pincer movement to capture Lae . On 4 September the 9th Division made an amphibious landing to the east of the town and began advancing to the west . The following day , the US 503rd Parachute Regiment made an unopposed parachute drop at Nadzab , just west of Lae . Once the airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield , the 7th Division was flown in and began advancing to the east in a race with the 9th Division to capture Lae . This race was won by the 7th Division , which captured the town on 15 September . The Japanese forces at Salamaua and Lae suffered heavy losses during this campaign , but were able to escape to the north . After the fall of Lae the 9th Division was given the task of capturing the Huon Peninsula . The 20th Brigade landed near the strategic harbour of Finschhafen on 22 September 1943 and secured the area . The Japanese responded by dispatching the 20th Division overland to the area and the remainder of the 9th Division was gradually brought in to reinforce the 20th Brigade against the expected counter-attack . The Japanese mounted a strong attack in mid-October which was defeated by the 9th Division after heavy fighting . During the second half of November the 9th Division captured the hills inland of Finschhafen from well dug in Japanese forces . Following its defeat , the 20th Division retreated along the coast with the 9th Division and 4th Brigade in pursuit . While the 9th Division secured the coastal region of the Huon Peninsula the 7th Division drove the Japanese from the inland Finisterre Range . The Finisterre Range campaign began on 17 September when the 2 / 6th Independent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley . The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly in the division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack on the key Shaggy Ridge position . The ridge was taken by the end of the month , with the RAAF playing a key supporting role . Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21 April and secured Madang on 24 April . = = = Advance to the Philippines = = = The Australian military 's role in the South-West Pacific decreased during 1944 as US forces took over responsibility for the main Allied effort in the region . In the latter half of 1943 the Australian Government decided , with MacArthur 's agreement , that the size of the military would be decreased to release manpower for war-related industries which were important to supplying Britain and US forces in the Pacific . Australia 's main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food , materials and manufactured goods needed for the defeat of Japan . As a result of this policy , the size of the Army was reduced from late 1943 onwards , though an offensive force of six infantry divisions ( three AIF and three Militia divisions ) was maintained until the end of the war . In early 1944 all but two of the Army 's divisions were withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland for training and rehabilitation . However , several new battalions of Australian-led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the Pacific Islands Regiment . These troops had earlier seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign , and they largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year . While the Australian Government offered I Corps for use in Leyte and Luzon , nothing came of several proposals to utilise it in the liberation of these islands . The Army 's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern , and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if it could not be used for offensive operations . This was politically embarrassing for the government , and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be used . It also impacted upon the Army 's morale ; as the Allies advanced further towards Japan , the Army was increasingly relegated to \" second string \" roles , despite having fought \" above its weight \" for most of the war . = = = Mopping up in New Guinea and the Solomons = = = In late 1944 , the Australian Government committed twelve Australian Army brigades to replace six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville , New Britain and the Aitape \u2013 Wewak area in New Guinea in order to free up the American units for operations in the Philippines . While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions , their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas . The value of these campaigns was controversial at the time and remains so to this day as the Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political , rather than military , reasons . It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia 's influence in its region . Critics of these campaigns , such as author Peter Charlton , argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective . The 5th Division replaced the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain campaign with the goals of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul . In late November the 5th Division established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau . The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas . By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force 's aggressive patrolling . The 5th Division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign . After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong , which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain . The II Corps continued the Bougainville campaign after it replaced the US Army 's XIV Corps between October and December 1944 . The corps consisted of the 3rd Division , 11th Brigade and Fiji Infantry Regiment on Bougainville and the 23rd Brigade which garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by RAAF , Royal New Zealand Air Force and United States Marine Corps air units . While the XIV Corps had maintained a defensive posture , the Australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying the Japanese force on Bougainville . As the Japanese were split into several enclaves the II Corps fought separate offensives in the northern , central and southern portions of the island . The main focus was against the Japanese base at Buin in the south , and the offensives in the north and centre of the island were largely suspended from May 1945 . While Australian operations on Bougainville continued until the end of the war , large Japanese forces remained at Buin and in the north of the island . The 6th Division was assigned responsibility for completing the destruction of the Japanese Eighteenth Army , which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea . Supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships , the division was reinforced by Militia and armoured units and began arriving at Aitape in October 1944 . In late 1944 the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards Wewak . The 17th Brigade advanced inland through the Torricelli Mountains while the remainder of the division moved along the coast . Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease , it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties . The 6th Division 's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather . The Australians secured the coastal area by early May , and Wewak was captured on 10 May after a small force was landed east of the town . By the end of the war the Eighteenth Army had been forced into what it had designated its \" last stand \" area . The Aitape \u2013 Wewak campaign cost 442 Australian lives while about 9,000 Japanese died and another 269 were taken prisoner . = = = Borneo campaign = = = The Borneo campaign of 1945 was the last major Allied campaign in the South West Pacific . In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July , the Australian I Corps , under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead , attacked Japanese forces occupying the island . Allied naval and air forces , centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and the US Thirteenth Air Force , also played important roles in the campaign . The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo 's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945 . The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur 's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945 , however , and its decision not to release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead . The campaign opened on 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group landed on the small island of Tarakan off the east coast of Borneo to secure the island 's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan . While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip , intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June . As a result , the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile . The next phase began on 10 June when the 9th Division conducted simultaneous assaults in north-west Labuan and on the coast of Brunei . While Brunei was quickly secured , the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week . After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24th Brigade was landed in North Borneo and the 20th Brigade advanced along the western coast of Borneo south from Brunei . Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance and most of north-west Borneo was liberated by the end of the war . During the campaign the 9th Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces such as Z Special Unit . The third and final stage of the campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of Borneo . This operation had been opposed by Blamey , who believed that it was unnecessary , but went ahead on the orders of MacArthur . After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July . Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but mopping up continued until the end of the war as isolated pockets of Japanese resistance remained . The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World War II . Although the Borneo campaign was criticised in Australia at the time , and in subsequent years , as pointless or a waste of soldiers ' lives , it did achieve a number of objectives , such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the NEI , capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war , who were being held in deteriorating conditions . = = = Post-war years = = = Prior to the end of the war on 15 August 1945 , the Australian military was preparing to contribute forces to the invasion of Japan . Australia 's participation in this operation would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces . It was planned to form a new 10th Division from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the Commonwealth Corps with British , Canadian and New Zealand units . The corps ' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps , and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of Honsh\u016b which was scheduled for March 1946 under Operation Coronet . Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August 1945 when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Japanese field commanders subsequently surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre and Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai , several locations in Borneo , Timor , Wewak , Rabaul , Bougainville and Nauru . Following the surrender the Australian Army faced a number of immediate operational and administrative issues , including the need to maintain security in the areas it occupied , the disarming and administration of surrendered Japanese forces in these areas , organising the return of approximately 177,000 soldiers ( including prisoners of war ) to Australia , the demobilisation and discharge of the bulk of the soldiers serving in the Army , and the raising of an occupation force for service in Japan . Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender . Under the terms of an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten , the head of South East Asia Command , Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo , the NEI east of Lombok ( including western New Guinea ) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific . The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945 . I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI , and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea . After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI . While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists , the Australians were careful to not become involved in the Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible . Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good , due in part to the decision by the Waterside Workers ' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI . The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946 . The Australian Army also contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . Volunteers for this force were recruited in late 1945 , with most being assigned to three new infantry battalions : the 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division , the 66th Battalion by men from the 6th Division and the 67th from 9th Division personnel . These and other units were grouped at Morotai as the 34th Brigade in October 1945 . The brigade 's departure for Japan was delayed until February 1946 by inter-Allied negotiations , but it eventually took over responsibility for enforcing the terms of the Japanese surrender in Hiroshima Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsular following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 . = = Leadership = = When the war began the Army was on the cusp of a generational change . At the time , the senior officers on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey , although Bennett had not held an appointment for seven years and Blamey for the last two . Then came the Chief of the General Staff , Major General John Lavarack ; the Adjutant General , Major General Sir Carl Jess ; Major General Owen Phillips , the Quartermaster General ; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman , the commander of the 3rd Division ; and Major General Iven Mackay , the commander 2nd Division . All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett , Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers . Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF , for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies . Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939 . Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) I Corps following its raising in March 1940 , while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division . The next most senior regular officers , all colonels , included men like Vernon Sturdee , Henry Wynter and John Northcott , all of whom had joined the Army before World War I. These officers held senior commands throughout the war , but seldom active ones . Below them were a distinct group of regular officers , graduates of the Royal Military College , Duntroon , which had opened in 1911 . Their number included Frank Berryman , William Bridgeford , Cyril Clowes , Horace Robertson , Sydney Rowell and George Alan Vasey . These officers had fought in World War I and reached the rank of major , but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years . Many left the Army to join the British or Indian armies , or the RAAF , or to return to civilian life . As a group , they had become embittered and resentful , and determined to prove that they could lead troops in battle . Many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with the British Army , which was important in the early years of the war when there was close cooperation between the two armies . Between the wars , the reservists enjoyed much better promotion prospects . While Alan Vasey , a major in the First AIF , was not promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel until 1937 , Kenneth Eather , a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I , was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935 . Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather than regular officers , who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy . Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige , Arthur Allen , Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring . Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders . The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer , Ivan Dougherty , David Whitehead , Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers ' contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability . At the start of the war , the majority of battalion commands went to older reservists , many of whom had commanded battalions or served in the First AIF . As the war went on , the average age of battalion commanders declined from 42.9 years old in 1940 to 35.6 in 1945 . The prevalence of regular officers in senior positions also rose , and in 1945 they held half of all senior appointments . They remained under-represented in unit commands , and , as in 1940 , there was still only one infantry battalion commanded by a regular officer . Following the outbreak of war with Japan , many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead Militia formations and fill important staff posts as the Army expanded . The following year , though , the Army reached its greatest extent after which it shrank in size . With a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than required , Blamey faced public and political criticism after he \" shelved \" several senior officers . The career prospects of junior officer were also affected , particularly in the infantry . Of the 52 officers promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in the last six months of 1944 only five were infantrymen , while two were engineers , and 45 were from the supporting arms . Meanwhile , the return of the AIF divisions to Australia from the Middle East in 1942 coincided with the arrival of large numbers of American troops , including the US 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions . From April 1942 MacArthur took over command of all US and Australian forces in the newly formed South West Pacific Area as Supreme Commander . Blamey had been appointed Commander-in-Chief AMF in March following his promotion to general , setting up Land Headquarters to subsume the role of the Military Board , which was suspended on 30 July . As Commander-in-Chief AMF he reported directly to MacArthur and was subsequently also given command of Allied Land Forces in the theatre . Yet although Australian forces made up the bulk of the Allied forces in SWPA until 1944 in practice for political reasons MacArthur ensured that Blamey only commanded Australian forces , while he also limited the number of Australian staff officers posted to General Headquarters , and they remained underrepresented for the remainder of the war . = = Equipment = = The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN , which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period . The result was that when war came in 1939 , the Army 's equipment was of World War I vintage , and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms . Most equipment was obsolescent and had to be replaced , and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons , equipment and motor vehicles . Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division , but since a division 's war establishment was around 3,000 , this was only enough for training . In February 1940 , the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes . Throughout the war , Australian infantry units were largely equipped with British-designed but Australian-made small arms and support weapons . The standard rifle was the SMLE No 1 Mk III * , manufactured since 1912 at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory . Small quantities of the Lee \u2013 Enfield No.4 Mk I / Mk I * rifle , made by the Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the US , were used in New Guinea although most of these rifles were provided to other branches of the Australian military and to the Volunteer Defence Corps in order to free up No.1 MkIII * rifles for frontline infantry units . American-made M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles and M1 carbines were also issued to some Australian infantry units attached to US Army formations in New Guinea . Direct fire support was provided by a mixture of machine guns , including the Vickers machine gun which was produced at Lithgow from 1929 , which were utilised by specialised machine-gun battalions and , later , also medium machine-gun platoons within infantry battalions . The Bren Gun replaced Lewis Gun as the standard automatic rifle in the early years of the war , and within infantry battalions was utilised at the section level . Their manufacture in Australia started in 1941 . To improve rates of fire , the American Thompson submachine gun was introduced but it was eventually replaced by the Australian-designed Owen Gun and the British-designed but Australian-modified and -made Austen submachine gun . Infantry platoons were also equipped with M36 grenades . The Boys anti-tank rifle was the standard infantry anti-tank weapon at the start of the war , but was replaced with the PIAT in 1943 . The heavier support weapons used by infantry battalions the war included the 2-inch mortar and Stokes 3-inch mortar . Infantry battalions were also equipped with Universal Carriers until being converted to the tropical warfare establishment in 1943 , when the organic carrier platoons were consolidated into companies assigned at divisional level . A man-pack flamethrower was also introduced in 1945 . Not until 17 January 1940 did Richard Casey obtain Cabinet 's approval to spend \u00a3 400,000 to construct a plant to manufacture 25 pounder field guns and 2 pounder anti-tank guns . Until the 25 pounder could become available in quantity , units in Australia and the Far East were equipped with the old 18 pounder . Some units in the Middle East operated the 18 / 25 pounder , an 18 pounder that had been re-bored to take 25 pounder ammunition , until they received British 25 pounders . The old 4.5 inch howitzer also saw service , with the 2 / 10th Field Regiment employing them in support of the 9th Division during the Siege of Tobruk . A collection of captured Italian guns , known as the \" Bush Artillery \" , were also employed . These were rendered obsolete when the 25 pounder became available in quantity . Eventually , 1,527 were manufactured in Australia . A special light weight version known as the Short 25 pounder was developed for jungle warfare . The requirement for a portable field piece in mountainous jungle led to the use of the 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer in the New Guinea campaign . The American 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 was also employed . Experience in the Western Desert campaign soon showed that the 2 pounder could not deal with German tanks , and it was superseded by the 6 pounder , which began coming off the assembly lines in Australia in July 1942 . In turn it was replaced in 1944 by the 17 pounder , which was manufactured at the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory . The anti-aircraft artillery were equipped with the Swedish-designed Bofors 40 mm gun , which was manufactured in Australia , and the British 3.7 inch Anti-Aircraft gun . Medium artillery included the American 155 mm Long Tom and the British 5.5 inch gun . The need for tanks to equip armoured units led the War Cabinet to approve the manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940 . Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943 , but none were used in action . Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas . A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941 , while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942 , and these proved to be the most suitable type for jungle warfare . A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign . The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee . Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions , but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas , they did not see action . An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944 . The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors . The Australian Army developed its own landing craft . Development of an Australian version of the Landing Craft Assault , the ALCV ( Australian Landing Craft , Vehicle ) , was carried out by Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company . Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River . The initial version , known as the ALCV I was found to be too small , so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed . An Australian version of the Landing Craft Mechanized , the ALCM , was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong . Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing craft , so the ALCV III , an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity , was produced . The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs , a type of similar capacity to an American Landing Craft Tank , with five Ford V8 engines . Only four were delivered before the end of the war , but they arrived in time to see service in New Guinea . By 1945 , due to a shrinking number of operational units and stepped up production , equipment shortages were a thing of the past . Indeed , the Army had more equipment that it actually needed . For example , a total of 368 25 pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand . Additionally , a total of 530 2 pounder and 6 pounder anti-tank guns were required , but the Army had 1,941 , while 68 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training , but there were 640 pieces available . Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren , of which 9,438 were required , but there were 21,139 in the system . The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required , due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare . = = Training and doctrine = = The Australian Army 's pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment . This doctrine and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries . Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa . By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment . However , there were also critical shortages of instructors . The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel , but there were few officers and men with the required skills in the small pre-war Army and many of them were already serving in the AIF 's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments . An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal , Victoria , in 1941 , and in March 1943 , the Armoured Corps Training Centre was moved there . Another problem for the Militia was a lack of continuity in the training . When the war began , men were called up for only one month 's additional training . This was then increased to three months ' additional training . In 1940 \u2013 41 , officers and non-commissioned officers were intensively trained for 18 to 24 days , after which there was a camp for 70 days . Meanwhile , soldiers who had been through the 90-day training regimen in 1939 \u2013 40 were given 12 days ' additional training , while those who had not completed this training undertook 70 days . This allowed for individual training , but prevented proper unit training . In July 1941 , fully trained soldiers who had completed 90 days ' training became liable for three months ' additional training per year while new recruits were liable for six months . At the same time , the War Cabinet provided for more intensive training for the full-time cadre of Militia units , which were not to exceed 25 percent of the unit 's strength . Training for the Militia and the VDC was also hampered in the early war years by a lack of small arms , particularly after the Dunkirk evacuation when Australia dispatched its reserve stock of rifles to Britain , in an effort to help replace equipment lost by the British Army , amidst concerns of an invasion of the United Kingdom after the Fall of France . Although the Army 's focus was on conventional warfare , in late 1940 Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood , a British officer , arrived in Australia with a small specialist staff to conduct training in unconventional warfare . A school , known as No. 7 Infantry Training Centre , was opened at Wilsons Promontory , Victoria , which was described as \" an isolated area of high , rugged and heavily timbered mountains , precipitous valleys , swiftly running streams , and swamps . \" The 1st , 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies and a nucleus of the 4th were raised by October 1941 when training was discontinued . After the outbreak of the war with Japan , the school was reopened as the Guerrilla Warfare School , the training of the fourth company was completed . These independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons , of which twelve were eventually raised , including the 1st , which had been destroyed early in the war ; as the war progressed they were used more in the flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare . The Australian Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1942 . Some lessons were passed on by officers who escaped from Malaya and Singapore , however , and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in May that year . AIF units that returned from North Africa undertook some training in jungle tactics before going into action , but the Militia units which initially faced the Japanese in New Guinea suffered from inadequate training , and this led to them suffering heavy casualties . In order to be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly , to acclimatise them during the process , and to allow more realistic training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain , Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942 . Eventually , accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops . As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944 , they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment . The men then went on leave , after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South-West Pacific . The Army 's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during the year . A jungle warfare school was opened at Canungra , Queensland , in November 1942 , and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit . Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre , an Independent Company training centre , and a tactical school . With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed . Over time , training programs included greater cooperation between the Army 's combat arms and with the other services . A Combined Training Centre , also known as HMAS Assault , opened on 1 September 1942 at Nelson Bay , adjacent to Port Stephens , New South Wales , as a central establishment for the training staffs , beach parties and small boat crews . In July 1942 , a Combined Training School was established at Bribie Island , Queensland , and nearby Toorbul Point for Army units . During 1943 and 1944 , combined training with the RAAF and RAN was also carried out at Trinity Beach , near Cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in the South West Pacific as the Allies advanced . The Australian Army began training paratroops in December 1942 as an offshoot of the training of Independent Companies . The 1st Parachute Battalion was subsequently formed in March 1943 . It reached full strength by January 1944 , but , although it was warned for action a number of times , including the possible rescue of prisoners of war held at Sandakan in 1945 , it did not see any fighting . After the war it participated in the reoccupation of Singapore . By 1945 the Army possessed a comprehensive schools system , with 40 schools of various kinds . Between 1942 and 1945 96,000 training courses were conducted . Soldiers who were selected to become officers were trained at various Officer Cadet Training Units around the country , and by the end of the war these units had produced 7,887 officers . Meanwhile , regular officers of the PMF continued to be trained at the Royal Military College , Duntroon with a number of shortened courses of between six months and a years ' duration being run . Unlike the First AIF , newly commissioned lieutenants were not sent back to their original unit , but were posted to the first vacancy . Other schools included the School of Artillery , the Guerrilla Warfare School , the Cooking and Catering School , the School of Military Law and the School of Movement and Transport . Recruit training was now thorough and exacting , and for infantrymen culminated in a jungle training course at Canungra , where the Jungle Warfare School turned out 4,000 reinforcements a month . In 1945 , the 29th Brigade received 1,000 young reinforcements shortly before embarking for Torokina , but their commander later remarked that their training at Canungra had been so thorough that they \" reacted with almost miraculous quickness to conditions of battle . \" = = Prisoners of war = = Nearly 29,000 Australians were taken prisoner by the Axis during the war , the bulk of them members of the Australian Army . During the fighting in the Middle East and Greece , 7,116 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner by German and Italian forces . Of these men , 3,109 were captured at Crete and 2,065 on the mainland of Greece . Most of the other POWs were members of the 9th Division captured during the retreat from Cyrenaica in early 1941 , the siege of Tobruk or the fighting near El Alamein in mid-1942 . Like other western Allied POWs , the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany and were generally treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions . As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies . These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths . As the war drew to a close , a unit designated the AIF Reception Group ( United Kingdom ) was established near Eastbourne in England to provide accommodation and support for the POWs once they were released . By August 1945 all the former Australian POWs in Europe had embarked on ships bound for Australia . While Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World War I , it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment . More than 21,000 members of the AIF were captured by the Japanese during the first months of 1942 . Most of these men were members of the 8th Division captured at Singapore , the NEI and Rabaul , but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there . Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly , resulting in a high death rate . Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships . While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease , hundreds were murdered by their guards . The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences , as 13,000 Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese ; nearly 2,650 Australians died there . Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions . The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates ; 77 percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500 Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived ; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945 . Overall , only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity . The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease . The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war . Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country 's zone of responsibility after the war , and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered war crimes trials . = = Demobilisation = = The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities , although it had partially commenced as early as 1943 . At the end of the war the strength of the Australian Army was 398,594 men , approximately half of which were serving overseas in the South West Pacific Area . The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 August 1945 , the day after Japan surrendered . Undertaken in four phases , it was finally completed on 15 February 1947 by which time a total of 349,964 soldiers had been discharged . Although the process largely proceeded smoothly , many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in the South West Pacific after the war ended . The speed of demobilisation was hampered by the requirement to continue to maintain security in the areas still occupied , the lack of sufficient shipping , the administrative workload entailed , and limited facilities for use for the demobilisation process . Although the Second AIF was not disbanded until 30 June 1947 a temporary organisation known as the Interim Army was established at the end of the war and included all members of the Army on full-time duty . Meanwhile , in a departure from previous defence policy the Australian government decided that a small peace-time regular force was to be raised to provide a trained , full-time force capable of being deployed either in Australia or overseas in a national emergency and the Australian Regular Army was subsequently established on 30 September 1947 . The Militia , under the guise of the Citizen Military Forces , was re-established on 1 July 1948 to provide a part-time volunteer force which would be able to provide the basis for expansion in wartime . = = Casualties = = In the course of the fighting the Australian Army sustained approximately 61,000 battle casualties , the bulk of them from the Second AIF . This included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . 5,558 were killed or died in captivity , while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war . Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded / injured in operational areas , and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded / injured in non-operational areas . The large number of non-battle casualties was significant , illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army .",

The first church on the site is said to have been built by St Fflewin in 630 , but the present building has no structural features dating from before the 18th century , although the church has a font from the 14th or 15th century and part of an inscribed medieval gravestone has been reused in a window sill . The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of five churches in a combined benefice . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , because it is a \" simple rural church built on Medieval foundations \" . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey said that it is a \" typical , well-preserved rural church and is well worth a visit . \" = = History and location = = St Fflewin , to whom the church is dedicated , was a Christian who was active in the 6th century . He is described as the son of Ithel Hael , who came to Britain from Armorica ( present-day northern France ) towards the end of the 5th century . He established a Christian site at the location of the present church in 630 ( according to the Diocese of Bangor and a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey ) , although a 19th-century guide to Wales by the writer Samuel Lewis says that it was sometime early in the 7th century . No part of a building from that period survives . There was a church here by 1254 , since it is recorded in the Norwich Taxation of that year . The present building is thought by Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales ) to be \" probably built upon Medieval foundations \" , albeit that the earliest dateable feature of the structure is from the late 18th century . After some repairs in the early part of the 19th century , St Fflewin 's was partially rebuilt ( \" judiciously \" , says a 2009 guide to the buildings of north-west Wales ) in 1864 and further restored during the 1930s . The Welsh poet and clergyman Morris Williams ( better known by his bardic name \" Nicander \" ) was rector here from 1859 until his death in 1874 ; he was buried at Llanrhuddlad , one of the other Anglesey churches for which he had responsibility . The church is isolated , located in the countryside of north Anglesey by a farm , about 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) from Llanrhuddlad , in an area of Anglesey known as Mynydd Mechell . Llanfflewin takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , so \" Llanfflewin \" means \" Church of Fflewin \" . It is set within a raised circular enclosure , with an arched lychgate ( possibly of 17th-century date ) . It is still in use for worship , and belongs to the Church in Wales , as one of five churches in the combined benefice of Llanfechell with Bodewryd with Rhosbeirio with Llanfflewin and Llanbadrig . It is within the deanery of Twrcelyn , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the rector is Canon G W Edwards . = = Architecture and fittings = = The church , which is small and rectangular , has no internal division between the nave and the chancel . It measures 47 feet 6 inches by 14 feet 9 inches ( 14.5 by 4.5 m ) . It is built of rubble masonry , and the roof is made of slate ; there is a gabled bellcote at the west end of the roof . The roof timbers can be seen from the inside . Entrance to the church is through a porch with a rounded arch at the west end of the south wall , and there is a vestry , with one window , at the west end of the north wall . The windows in the south and north walls are rectangular pairs ; the window in the east wall is in the form of a rounded arch , with two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) . The sill of the window has a fragment of a medieval gravestone ( dating from some time after 1300 ) set into it , inscribed HIC IACET MADOCUS . The church has a \" roughly dressed \" font with nine sides , dating from the 14th or 15th century . There are a number of slate memorial tablets on the north and south walls from the 18th century . A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also recorded a bier , with the initials \" W.W. \" and the date 1784 , and an Elizabethan silver cup with a cover-paten , the paten having an engraved date of 1574 . It also noted a wooden pitch pipe and wooden shovel , both dating from the late 18th century . = = Assessment = = The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated by Cadw ( on behalf of the National Assembly for Wales ) as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 , and has been listed because it is \" a simple rural church built on Medieval foundations \" . Cadw also notes that it retains \" the vernacular character of a pre gothic revival church \" . Samuel Lewis said that the church , which he described as \" a plain edifice \" , was \" beautifully situated near a small lake , and surrounded with pleasing scenery \" . The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church on 4 September 1867 . He said that the church \" has been so completely modernised , that it is doubtful whether any original feature remains but the bell-gable and one single light window in the north wall \" . He said that the font was of \" singular design \" : \" octagonal , swelling downwards and each face concave . \" He also said that the site was \" wild and striking . \" A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that it is \" a typical , well-preserved rural church and is well worth a visit . \"",

The first church in this location is said to have been established by St Deiniol Fab ( to whom the church is dedicated ) in 616 . He was the son of St Deiniol , the first Bishop of Bangor . The current building , which is in Early English style , incorporates some material and fittings from an earlier church on the site , including the font and an 18th-century memorial in the porch . The vestry door has medieval jambs and the keystone of its arch , which is also medieval , is a carved human face . Some parts of the nave walls may also come from a previous building here . The church is no longer used for worship , and the village is now served by a church in Llanfairpwll . As of 2011 , the building ( without the surrounding grounds ) was for sale . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is regarded as \" a good example of a simple 19th-century rural church \" . = = History and location = = St Deiniol 's Church is near the centre of Llanddaniel Fab , a village in the south of Anglesey , north Wales . It is reached from the street by passing through a lychgate by the local war memorial . The village takes its name from the church ; the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and -ddaniel is a modified form of the saint 's name . The date of first construction of a Christian place of worship in the area is uncertain , but it is said by 19th-century writers that a son of St Deiniol ( the first Bishop of Bangor ) established a church here in 616 . The son , also a saint , was known as Deiniol Fab ( Welsh for \" Deiniol the son \" ) , to distinguish him from his father . No part of a building from that time survives . A later edifice , dating from the 16th century or perhaps earlier , was replaced in the 19th century . Some parts of that structure may have been reused in the current church , as the 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire considered that sections of the walls of the nave may be from the older building . In 1833 , the antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the old church as \" a very ancient and dilapidated structure \" , which had \" some good specimens of the architecture of a very remote period \" . Writing in 1846 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones described it as one \" so much altered by successive reparations , that little of its original architectural character has been preserved \" . Repairs were carried out to the new church , and a vestry added to the north side , in 1873 . The work was overseen by Henry Kennedy , architect of the Diocese of Bangor . St Deiniol 's is no longer in use ; in 2006 , a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that no services had been held for a number of years , and added that ivy was growing across the building . The church 's former parish has been merged with that of the adjoining village of Llanfairpwll , served by St Mary 's , Llanfairpwll . As of January 2011 , the church ( without the grounds ) was on sale for \u00a3 50,000 ; it was suggested by the estate agents handling the sale that it could be used as a studio or for storage , subject to necessary consents being obtained . People associated with St Deiniol 's include the clergymen Henry Rowlands and Isaac Jones . Rowlands , who wrote a history of Anglesey ( Mona Antiqua Restaurata ) in 1723 , served as priest here and in nearby parishes from 1696 onwards . Jones , a translator , was curate of St Deiniol 's from 1840 until his death in 1850 . = = Architecture and fittings = = The Gothic Revival church is in the Early English style . It is built from rubble masonry dressed with limestone and has a slate roof . The vestry is partially built from material used in the old church . The door in the vestry 's north wall has medieval doorjambs , and the keystone of the pointed arch , which is also medieval , is a carved human face . The nave of the church ( where the congregation sat ) has no aisle . The chancel ( site of the altar ) is at the east end of the nave . There is a porch , which contains an 18th-century memorial , on the south side of the nave towards the west end , and a vestry to the north . Each section is steeply gabled , with the west end terminating in a bellcote surmounted by a cross and containing a single bell . The windows in the nave have two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) , save for one to the west of the porch , which has one light . The east end of the chancel has three adjoining lancet windows , the tallest in the middle . Internally , the walls have panelling at the bottom and painted plasterwork above . The roof has exposed timbers . There is a pointed chancel arch and three steps between the nave and chancel , with a further step to the sanctuary , which has a mosaic floor . The east windows and those on the north have stained glass . Fittings include the rectangular pulpit , the pews , and the altar table , which are all made of pine wood , and the octagonal font , made of granite with carvings on each side . The 1937 Royal Commission survey recorded that the church owned a plain silver cup , dated 1796 \u2013 1797 . A visual inspection of the church in 2006 determined that there were many cobwebs inside , but also that the pews and organ remained in place . = = Assessment = = St Deiniol 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" .

The date of foundation of the church , which is in the village of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy , is unknown , but the oldest parts date from the 11th or 12th century . It has twice been enlarged : in the 15th century , when the chancel was rebuilt , and in the 16th century , when a chapel was added to the south of the chancel , separated by three arches . The tower at the west end is from the 17th century . A south porch of unknown date has been converted into a vestry , and the church is now entered through the tower . St Mary 's is a Grade I listed building , a national designation given to buildings of \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" , in particular because it is regarded as \" a fine rural parish church , incorporating significant early Medieval fabric \" . Writers in the 19th century commented on the \" lofty square tower \" , the \" very good \" east window , and the \" many elegant monuments \" ; the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones called St Mary 's \" one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island \" . In the 21st century , one writer has noted the \" impressive lychgate \" and a guide to the buildings of the region calls it \" the most important church in north west Anglesey \" . The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of nine in a combined parish , although as of 2013 there has not been an incumbent priest since September 2009 . People associated with the church include James Williams , a 19th-century rector who was awarded a gold medal for his efforts to save lives at sea , and his great-grandson , the artist Sir Kyffin Williams . Both are buried in the churchyard . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is the parish church for the village of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in the north-west of Anglesey , north Wales . It is set in a churchyard at the side of a minor road , in the south-east of the village . The area is near the coast , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) from the port town of Holyhead . Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy takes its name in part from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and \" \u2011 fair \" is a modified form of the saint 's name ( Mair being Welsh for \" Mary \" ) . The parish \u2019 s coastal position is reflected in its full name , which means \" St Mary 's in the promontory \" , or \" St Mary in the angle of the waters \" . It is uncertain when the first church was constructed on the site . There was a church in Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy before 1254 , mentioned in the Norwich Taxation of that year . The oldest parts of the present structure are the nave walls and the arch between the nave and the chancel ( to the east of the nave ) ; these date from the 11th or 12th century . In the 15th century , the chancel was reconstructed and enlarged ; in the following century , a chapel was added to the south of the chancel , separated by an arcade of three arches . In her 1833 history of Anglesey , Angharad Llwyd said that the south chapel \" belongs exclusively \" to one of the local landed estates , and the chancel belonged to another . A tower was added at the west end in the 17th century , perhaps in 1660 according to a 2009 guide to the buildings of the region . At some stage , a porch was added to the south-west corner of the nave , but it has \" no datable features \" . In the middle of the 19th century the porch entrance was blocked off and replaced by a window , and since then access to the church has been through a door on the west side of the tower . Some restoration work was carried out in 1847 by the Sheffield-based architects Weightman and Hadfield . Their plans included a proposal to add a chapel to the north side , but this did not happen . Further work was undertaken in 1860 , and some repairs were carried out in the chancel and south chapel in the 1930s under the architect and historian Harold Hughes . St Mary 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of nine churches in the combined benefice of Bodedern with Llanfaethlu . It is within the deanery of Llifion and Talybolion , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2013 , there is no incumbent priest at the church , and there has not been one since September 2009 . James Williams , rector of St Mary 's from 1821 to 1872 , helped to establish the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Lives from Shipwreck in 1828 , in the wake of a storm that caused a boat to sink with 140 deaths . He was awarded a gold medal by the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck ( later renamed the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ) in 1835 , for his efforts in the rescue of a boat during a gale . Angharad Llwyd , writing when Williams was at St Mary 's , noted that \" this benevolent gentleman , aided by his lady , ever alert in the cause of humanity , are generally among the first on the shore , in case of accident , well supplied with restoratives , and other necessaries , to comfort and protect the suffering mariners . \" The artist Sir Kyffin Williams ( 1918 \u2013 2006 ) was a great-grandson of James and his wife Frances . At his request , a memorial to them was put up on the south wall of the chapel . James , Frances and Kyffin are buried in the churchyard . The churchyard also contains the Commonwealth war graves of a Royal Navy sailor of World War I and another from World War II . = = Architecture and fittings = = = = = Structure = = = St Mary 's is a medieval church , built using rubble masonry dressed with freestone and displaying Perpendicular details . The roof is made of slate with stone copings . Internally , the timbers of the roofs of the nave , chancel and chapel are exposed . The beams running the length of the nave are decorated at intervals by painted plaster shield designs . The chancel roof is from the late 15th century , and the chapel roof is from the early part of the following century . = = = Interior = = = The church is entered through the door at the west side of the tower , with modern double doors between the tower and the nave set into a plain square doorway dating from the 17th or 18th century . The nave is 27 feet 9 inches by 13 feet 8 inches ( 8.5 by 4.2 m ) . Between the nave and the chancel there is a plain round arch , from the 11th or 12th century , a step up , and a rail . At the east end of the chancel , there is a further step up from the chapel into the sanctuary , which has some 18th-century gravestones set into it . The late 15th-century chancel , which measures 32 feet 6 inches by 14 feet ( 9.9 by 4.3 m ) , has some memorials from the 18th and early 19th centuries . One is to a bonesetter called Evan Thomas ( died 1814 ) , erected by Thomas Bulkeley , 7th Viscount Bulkeley ; another , to Emma Viscountess Bulkeley Williams , is made from ornately decorated marble . The three arches between the chancel and chapel rest on octagonal columns . One of the arches has inscribed upon it , in early 16th-century lettering , SCA MARIA ORA PRO ME DAVID A JACO ( \" Saint Mary pray for me David ap Iago \" ) ; another has a stone with a roughly carved face . There was once a rood screen across the chancel , as shown by markings on the north wall and on the westernmost of the arches . It was still in position in 1867 , when one visitor mentioned it in his notes on the church . Panelling has been fixed to the east and south walls of the sanctuary in the chapel as a reredos . The chapel measures 32 feet 6 inches by 14 feet 6 inches ( 9.9 by 4.4 m ) . The font is at the rear of the nave on the north side . It is octagonal on the outside , with a circular bowl inside . A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded : a large silver chalice , inscribed with the donor 's name and the year 1713 ; a plain silver paten , dated 1724 \u2013 25 ; and a pewter flagon , from about 1710 . = = = Windows = = = The nave has two windows . The south window , to the east of the vestry , is from the 14th century . It has two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) with flat tops and is decorated with stone tracery . A survey of the church in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted the window \u2019 s \" crude workmanship and design . \" The window on the north nave wall has three lights with rounded tops . It too has been dated to the 14th century , but other sources say that it is from the 16th century . A 2009 guide to buildings of north-west Wales says that the window is \" typically 16th-century \" . The 15th-century window at the east end of the chancel has three lights topped with cinquefoils ( a pattern of five joined circles ) . The lights are decorated with tracery , and set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould . Stained glass from 1850 depicts ( from north to south ) Christ with children , Christ at a table , and the cross . The north window in the chancel is a 19th-century copy of the north nave window . There are two windows in the chapel , each with three lights ; one in the east wall from the 16th century set in an arch with a hood mould , the other in the south wall set in a flat-headed frame . = = = Tower and porch = = = The tower has external buttresses and the door on the west side is set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould . The buttresses and door were added to the tower after it was built ; the 1937 Royal Commission survey described them as \" modern \" . There are two stages ( levels ) to the tower ; the tall upper stage is slightly narrower than the base , which measures 8 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 9 inches ( 26 by 2.7 m ) . The tower has simple rectangular openings in the north , east and south walls . There is a 17th-century bell in the west wall of the tower in a plain arch opening ; the top of the wall is crenellated . Behind the parapet at the top of the tower , there is a short spire in the shape of a pyramid , made from wood and covered in slates . The south porch has been described as \" unusually long \" ; it measures 11 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 9 inches ( 3.5 by 2.7 m ) and has been used as a vestry since the external doorway was blocked off and converted into a window . The 14th-century doorway from the nave into the vestry has a pointed head in a square frame , and was described in the 1937 survey as having an \" unusual design \" .

It was given this status on 12 May 1970 , as \" a fine rural parish church , incorporating significant early Medieval fabric , including a 12th-century chancel arch \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the \" good late Medieval additions , including a fine 16th-century arcaded chapel \u201d , and says that St Mary 's is of \" special interest \" because of its early date , \" and for the quality of its later detail \" . Writing in 1833 , before the restoration of 1847 , Angharad Llwyd described the church as \" a spacious ancient structure , partly in the Norman style , with a lofty square tower , of rude architecture \" . She noted the \" massive circular pillars and arches \" in the chancel , and the \" peculiar good taste \" of the architecture of the recently rebuilt rectory . The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis remarked upon the \" many elegant monuments \" in the church . Writing in 1862 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that it was \" one of the largest churches in this division of Anglesey \" He said that it had recently been \" judiciously repaired and restored \" by James Williams and was \" now one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island \" , adding that the east window was \" good in detail and in execution \" . The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1867 . He said that the east window was \" a very good Perpendicular one of three lights , early in the style . \" He described the churchyard as \" secluded , and shaded by fine trees \" and the tower as \" rude and plain \" , noting that the \" open bell arch \" on the west side was comparable to the one at St Mary 's Church , Llanerchymedd . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes the \" fairly large church \" as standing in a \" quiet wooded location \" . It also comments upon the \" impressive lychgate \" at the entrance to the churchyard and the \" squat pyramidal structure \" on top of the tower . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the former county of Gwynedd calls St Mary 's \" the most important church of north-west Anglesey \" and says that it has \" an unusual plan \" .",

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust . The church stands in the centre of the town in a dominating position on Market Hill . A church has been on the site since at least 1180 , but the current structure dates from the 15th century , though there have been several restorations in the intervening period . Formerly a spired church , St. Peter 's now has a bell tower which , like the rest of the building , is mainly covered in flint . The interior of the church features paintings by George Frederick Bodley and Robert Cardinal , and a pipe organ originally made by T. C. Lewis . = = History = = The earliest documentary record of the church is in 1180 , when it was a chapel of ease to St Gregory 's church . The church was built in three stages , beginning with the first two bays of the chancel and the base of the tower in about 1330 \u2013 48 . The later stages of building were in about 1360 , and in about 1425 \u2013 50 . In 1643 , during the Civil War , the iconoclast William Dowsing damaged many of the items in the church . A restoration took place in 1685 , which included some alterations to the nave roof . A clock was installed in 1701 , and during the first half of the 18th century a spire of metal and wood was added ; this was replaced by another spire in 1810 . The church was restored again in 1858 \u2013 59 by William Butterfield ; this included removal of the three galleries and the box pews , re-laying the chancel floor , and replacement of the pulpit . Stained glass made by Hardman & Co. was installed in some of the windows , and more stained glass by Hardman was installed later in the century . In 1898 the chancel was restored and redecorated by George Frederick Bodley . A wooden reredos was installed in the Lady Chapel . The stonework of the exterior was restored in 1911 , when statues were inserted into three niches in the south porch . A further restoration took place in 1968 when the upper part of the tower was replaced , the spire was taken down , and most of Bodley 's paintings were removed from the chancel . The church was declared redundant in 1972 , and in 1976 was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund , the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust . A charitable trust , The Friends of St. Peter 's has been established to maintain and improve the church . Since being made redundant , the church has been used occasionally for services , and for a variety of events , including concerts , organ recitals and exhibitions . = = Architecture = = = = = Exterior = = = The church is constructed mainly in flint , with some stone , brick and tiles . Its plan is not quite rectangular , as it had to be confined into a limited space . The northwest corner is cut across , and the chancel is not fully in alignment with the nave . The plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory , north and south aisles , a two-bay chancel with the organ chamber and vestry to the north and the Lady Chapel to the south , and an extended sanctuary to the east , and a west tower incorporated in the body of the church . Its architectural styles are Decorated and Perpendicular . The tower is in three stages with angle buttresses . Its parapet consists of stepped battlements , and at the corners are statues rather than pinnacles . The aisles also have battlemented parapets , and there are more buttresses around the church . The main entrance to the church is through the west door at the base of the tower . Formerly the main entrance was through the south porch . The three statues on the exterior of the porch represent Christ , with Saint Peter on one side and Saint Gregory on the other . = = = Interior = = = The arcades are in six bays , the piers on the north arcade differing from those on the south . The roof is ceiled and divided into panels , with gilt bosses at the intersections . It is the only medieval nave roof in Suffolk to be ceiled and panelled in its original form . Some of Bodley 's painting remains on the chancel arch . In the south aisle is the octagonal 15th-century font . This was removed from the church in the 17th century to be used as a horse trough , but was returned to the church when the horses refused to drink from it . In the chancel the reredos designed by Bodley measures 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) high by 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide , and depicts the Crucifixion . On the sides of the chancel are 15th-century screens . In the Lady Chapel the font is carved with a depiction of the Nativity , and the reredos is a copy of Leonardo da Vinci 's Last Supper . Over the north and south doors are paintings of Moses and Aaron . These were painted by Robert Cardinall , and formerly hung in a position flanking the reredos at the east end of the church . The lectern , pulpit and altar are Victorian , as is the stained glass . The three-manual organ was built in 1911 by T. C. Lewis . It was renovated in 1942 by Henry Willis & Sons , and rebuilt in 1987 by Bishop . A major rebuild was carried out by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1999 . There is a ring of ten bells , the oldest three being cast in about 1470 , and the most recent two in 1978 .",

There has been a church in this area , even if not on this precise location , since at least 1254 , and 19th-century writers state that St Ffinan established the first church here in the 7th century . The church was rebuilt in 1841 , reusing a 12th-century font and 18th-century memorials , as well as the cross at the eastern end of the roof . The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of eight in a combined parish , and services are held weekly . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is considered to be \" a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style \" . The church is at the end of a gravel track in the countryside of central Anglesey , about 2.5 kilometres ( 1.6 mi ) from Llangefni , the county town . It is also on a footpath to Plas Penmynydd , once home to Owen Tudor , founder of the Tudor dynasty . = = History and location = = St Ffinan 's Church is in the countryside in the centre of Anglesey , north Wales , near the village of Talwrn , and about 2.5 kilometres ( 1.6 mi ) away from Llangefni , the county town of Anglesey . The parish church is at the end of a gravelled track , off a country lane between the lower part of Talwrn and the hamlet of Ceint to the south . It can also be accessed by public footpath from Plas Penmynydd , once home to Owen Tudor , grandfather of King Henry VII and founder of the Tudor dynasty . The parish takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , with \" -ffinan \" denoting the saint . The date of construction of the first church in this area is uncertain , although a church was recorded here in 1254 during the Norwich Taxation of churches . The 19th-century writers and antiquarians Angharad Llwyd and Samuel Lewis said that St Ffinan , to whom the church is dedicated , established the first church here towards the beginning of the 7th century , possibly around 620 . Llwyd described the old church in 1833 as \" a small neat edifice \" . The current building was designed by the architect John Welch and erected in 1841 , with the first service held on 6 July of that year . Welch also designed the church of St Nidan , Llanidan , in the south of Anglesey , which was built between 1839 and 1843 . St Ffinan 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of eight churches in a combined parish called Bro Cadwaladr . It is within the deanery of Synod Ynys Mon , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2016 , the vicar is Emlyn Williams , assisted by an associate priest , E. R. Roberts . Williams was appointed in 2007 ; before that , the position had been vacant for 20 years despite many attempts by the Church in Wales to fill it . Services are held at St Ffinan 's on the first to fourth Sundays of every month , either Cymun Bendigaid ( Welsh : Holy Communion ) or Foreol Weddi ( Morning Prayer ) ; on the fifth Sunday of the month , a service of Holy Communion is held at one of the churches in the parish . There are no midweek services . John Jones , who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727 , was also rector of St Ffinan 's during that time , as it was one of the benefices attached to the deanery . Jones is commememorated by a stone tablet on the wall of St Mary 's Church , Pentraeth , also in Anglesey . The antiquarian Nicholas Owen was perpetual curate here from 1790 until his death in 1811 ; he is buried at St Tyfrydog 's Church , Llandyfrydog , Anglesey . = = Architecture and fittings = = The church is small and rectangular , built from stone with a slate roof ; there is a bellcote at the west end of the roof . There is no internal structural division between the nave and the chancel . The style is Romanesque revival . There is a round-headed window in each of the three bays of the church , and a three-part window in the chancel . The doorway at the west end has small windows on either side , and a window above ; a stone slab between the upper window and the doorway has \" 1841 \" upon it . Stained glass has been inserted into the windows in memory of parishioners . A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a number of items that had been preserved from the old church . The circular font , made of gritstone , dates from the 12th-century ; it has a \" very crude interlacing strap ornament \" , and has been fitted upon a more modern base . There are two memorials from the 18th century , one dated 1705 to \" Iohn Lloyd of Hirdre Faig \" and one dated 1764 to \" Hugh , son of Richard Hugh of Ty-hen \" . The churchyard contains one Commonwealth war grave from the First World War , of Private Evan Oswald Thomas , a Royal Welsh Fusiliers soldier from Talwrn . = = Assessment = = St Ffinan 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed because it is considered to be \" a good essay in a simple Romanesque revival style \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) describes it as \" a small rural church \" . Samuel Lewis said that the new church was \" a plain structure in the old English style , with strong buttresses , which have a good effect , being so well suited to the exposed situation of the building . \" Writing in 1846 , the priest and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church , \" a modern erection of the Pseudo-Norman style \" , stood in \" a highly picturesque situation . \" He said that the cross at the east end of the roof came from the old church .

                    "text": "Bruton Dovecote = The Bruton Dovecote is a limestone tower that was built between the 15th and 17th century in Bruton in the English county of Somerset . The structure was once used as a dovecote , and may have been a watchtower or prospect tower prior to this . It is a Grade II * listed building and scheduled monument . It has been associated with Bruton Abbey and the Berkley family who owned the estate after the dissolution . It is known that the conversion to house pigeons and doves took place around 1780 . It was acquired by the National Trust in 1915 and they have managed the site since then undertaking restoration work . = = History = = Though the Bruton Dovecote 's date of construction is not known precisely , the structure was built some time between the 15th and 17th century . Architectural historian Lydia Greeves suggests that the building was once within the deerpark of Bruton Abbey and was adapted by the monks from a gabled Tudor tower . However , John and Pamela McCann , authors of The Dovecotes of Historical Somerset , claim that the structure was not built until after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 1530s . The authors claim that the Berkley family , who acquired the lands of the Abbey , constructed the building as a prospect tower . Dendrochronological dating commissioned by the National Trust found that timber in the door and window frames came from trees felled between 1554 and 1586 . The conversion to be a dovecote took place around 1780 . Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs , flesh , and dung . Although it is now a roofless ruin with some of the windows blocked up , it previously had a chimney and the fireplace can still be seen . The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets , whose family seat was at Stourhead , in 1915 . The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building ( Grade II * ) in 1961 . In the 1980s the dovecote was inspected as part of an investigation into an outbreak of psittacosis ( also known as parrot disease or parrot fever ) , a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci , at the adjoining King 's School . No cause was found for the infection . In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to the tops of the walls ; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof . Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging . In addition , car parking and educational signage was provided . This was partially funded by South Somerset council , Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of \u00a3 105,000 . = = Location = = The dovecote stands on Lusty Hill to the south of Bruton overlooking the town . It is approximately 370 metres ( 1,210 ft ) south of the Church of St Mary , and 230 metres ( 750 ft ) south of King 's School . It is on the Leland Trail . = = Architecture = = The square tower was built of local coursed oolitic limestone with Doulting stone dressings . The walls are 2 feet 8 inches ( 0.81 m ) thick at the base , and the tower is 6 square metres ( 65 sq ft ) in plan . The doorway has an ovolo moulded arch which is 5 feet 9 inches ( 1.75 m ) high . This suggests a construction date in the late 16th or early 17th century . Another entrance was made for cattle to enter at a later date but this has been blocked up . Several of the windows have also been filled with stone . On the north-east face there were two-light chamfered mullioned windows on each floor while on the north-west wall they were one- and two-light windows . It has over 200 pigeon holes , which were installed after the original construction , possibly before 1780 . Six tiers of nest boxes remain ; however there were previously several more , possibly as many as 850 . They are made of regular blocks of tufa each around 8 inches ( 200 mm ) square and 16 inches ( 410 mm ) deep .",

                    "text": "Chester Cathedral = Chester Cathedral is a Church of England cathedral and the mother church of the Diocese of Chester . It is located in the city of Chester , Cheshire , England . The cathedral ( formerly the abbey church of a Benedictine monastery , dedicated to Saint Werburgh ) is dedicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary . Since 1541 it has been the seat of the Bishop of Chester . The cathedral is a Grade I listed building , and part of a heritage site that also includes the former monastic buildings to the north , which are also listed Grade I. The cathedral , typical of English cathedrals in having been modified many times , dates from between 1093 and the early 16th century , although the site itself may have been used for Christian worship since Roman times . All the major styles of English medieval architecture , from Norman to Perpendicular , are represented in the present building . The cathedral and former monastic buildings were extensively restored during the 19th century ( amidst some controversy ) , and a free-standing bell-tower was added in the 20th century . The buildings are a major tourist attraction in Chester . In addition to holding services for Christian worship , the cathedral is used as a venue for concerts and exhibitions . = = History = = The city of Chester was an important Roman stronghold . There may have been a Christian basilica on the site of the present cathedral in the late Roman era , while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix . Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to St Paul and Saint Peter . This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from Saint Peter to Saint Werburgh . During the Dark Ages Barloc of Norbury , a Catholic Celtic saint and hermit , was venerated at Chester Cathedral with a feast day on 10 September . He is known to history mainly through the hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript ; he also occurs in a litany in the Tanner of the Bodleian Library , Oxford . In the 10th century , St Werburgh 's remains were brought to Chester , and 907 AD her shrine was placed in the church . It is thought that \u00c6thelfleda turned the church into a college of secular canons , and that it was given a charter by King Edgar in 968 . The collegiate church , as it was then , was restored in 1057 by Leofric , Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva . This church was razed to the ground around 1090 , with the secular canons evicted , and no known trace of it remains . In 1093 a Benedictine abbey was established on the site by Hugh Lupus , Earl of Chester , with the assistance of St Anselm and other monks from Bec in Normandy . The earliest surviving parts of the structure date from that time . The abbey church was not at that time the cathedral of Chester ; from 1075 to 1082 the cathedral of the diocese was the nearby church of St John the Baptist , after which the see was transferred to Coventry . In 1538 , during the dissolution of the monasteries , the monastery was disbanded and the shrine of Saint Werburgh was desecrated . In 1541 St Werburgh 's abbey became a cathedral of the Church of England , by order of Henry VIII . At the same time , the dedication was changed to Christ and the Blessed Virgin . The last abbot of St Werburgh \u2019 s Abbey , Thomas Clarke , became the first dean of the new cathedral , at the head of a secular chapter . Although little trace of the 10th-century church has been discovered , save possibly some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave , there is much evidence of the monastery of 1093 . This work in the Norman style may be seen in the northwest tower , the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings . The abbey church , beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end , was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14th centuries . At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries , the cloister , the central tower , a new south transept , the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style , and the southwest tower of the fa\u00e7ade had been begun . The west front was given a Tudor entrance , but the tower was never completed . In 1636 the space beneath the south west tower became a bishop 's consistory court . It was furnished as such at that time , and is now a unique survival in England , hearing its last case , that of an attempted suicide of a priest , in the 1930s . Until 1881 , the south transept , which is unusually large , also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity : the parish church of St Oswald . Although the 17th century saw additions to the furnishings and fittings , there was no further building work for several centuries . By the 19th century , the building was badly in need of restoration . The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers , particularly George Gilbert Scott . The 20th century has seen continued maintenance and restoration . In 1922 , the Chester War Memorial was installed in the cathedral grounds and dedicated to the fallen soldiers of the First World War and later the Second World War . In 1973 \u2013 75 a detached belfry , designed by George Pace , was erected in the grounds of the cathedral . In 2005 a new Song School was added to the cathedral . During the 2000s , the cathedral library was refurbished and relocated . It was officially reopened in September 2007 . The cathedral and the former monastic buildings were designated as Grade I listed buildings on 28 July 1955 . = = Architecture = = = = = Cathedral = = = = = = = Plan = = = = Chester Cathedral has an east-west axis , common to many cathedrals , with the chancel at the eastern end , and the fa\u00e7ade to the west . The plan is cruciform , with a central tower ( as is usual in English monastic churches ) , but is asymmetrical , having a small transept on the north side remaining from an earlier building , and an unusually large south transept . As the plan shows , the asymmetry extends to the west front , where the north tower remains from the Norman building , and the south tower is of the early 16th century . At the eastern end , the symmetrical arrangement of the aisles was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape . The nave , choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side , and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi-light windows in each of the three cliff-like ends . To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings , including the cloister , refectory and a rectangular chapter house . The fa\u00e7ade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings . = = = = External appearance = = = = LIke the cathedrals of Carlisle , Lichfield and Worcester , Chester Cathedral is built of New Red Sandstone , in this case Keuper Sandstone from the Cheshire Basin . The stone lends itself to detailed carving , but is also friable , easily eroded by rain and wind , and is badly affected by pollution . With the other red sandstone buildings , Chester is one of the most heavily restored of England 's cathedrals . The restoration , which included much refacing and many new details , took place mainly in the 19th century . Because the south transept is similar in dimension to the nave and choir , views of the building from the south-east and south-west give the impression of a building balanced around a central axis , with its tower as the hub . The tower is of the late 15th century Perpendicular style , but its four large battlemented turrets are the work of the restoration architect George Gilbert Scott . With its rhythmic arrangement of large , traceried windows , pinnacles , battlements and buttresses , the exterior of Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character , which is an unusual feature as England 's cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity . Close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16th century . The richness of the 13th-century tracery is accentuated by the presence of ornate , crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows ; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form . The fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral is dominated by a large deeply recessed eight-light window in the Perpendicular style , above a recessed doorway set in a screen-like porch designed , probably by Seth and George Derwall , in the early 1500s . This porch formed part of the same late 15th-century building programme as the south transept , central and southwest towers , and cloister . Neither of the west towers was completed . To the north is the lower stage of a Norman tower , while to the south is the lower stage of a tower designed and begun , probably by Seth and George Derwall , in 1508 , but left incomplete following the dissolution of the monastery in 1538 . The cathedral 's fa\u00e7ade is abutted on the north by a Victorian building housing the education centre and largely obscured from view by the building previously used as the King 's School , which is now a branch of Barclays Bank . The door of the west front is not used as the normal entrance to the cathedral , which is through the southwest porch which is in an ornate Tudor style . = = = = Interior = = = = The interior of Chester Cathedral gives a warm and mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone . The proportions appear spacious because the view from the west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave , although not long , is both wide and high compared with many of England 's cathedrals . The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced , those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery . The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault , like that at York Minster , is of wood , not stone . = = = = Norman remnants = = = = The present building , dating from around 1283 to 1537 , mostly replaced the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 which was built in the Norman style . It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one . That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions , while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief . Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept , which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy , which was formerly a chapel . The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses , two of which are carved with the arms of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey . The north west tower is also of Norman construction . It serves as the baptistry and houses a black marble font , consisting of a bowl on a large baluster dating from 1697 . The lower part of the north wall of the nave is also from the Norman building , but can only be viewed from the cloister because the interior has been decorated with mosaic . = = = = Early English = = = = The Early English Gothic chapter house , built between 1230 and 1265 , is rectangular and opens off a \" charming \" vestibule leading from the north transept . The chapter house has grouped windows of simple untraceried form . Alec Clifton-Taylor describes the exterior of this building as a \" modest but rather elegant example of composition in lancets \" while Nikolaus Pevsner says of the interior \" It is a wonderfully noble room \" which is the \" aesthetic climax of the cathedral \" . To the north of the chapter house is the slype , also Early English in style , and the warming room , which contains two large former fireplaces . The monastic refectory to the north of the cloister is of about the same date as the chapter house . The Lady Chapel to the eastern end of the choir dates from between 1265 and 1290 . It is of three bays , and contains the Shrine of St Werburgh , dating from the 14th century . The vault of the Lady Chapel is the only one in the cathedral that is of stone . It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity , the Madonna and Child , and the murder of Thomas Becket . The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina . = = = = Decorated Gothic = = = = The choir , of five bays , was built between 1283 and 1315 to the design of Richard Lenginour , and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture . The piers have strongly modelled attached shafts , supporting deeply moulded arches . There is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay . The sexpartite vault , which is a 19th-century restoration , is supported by clusters of three shafts which spring from energetic figurative corbels . The overall effect is robust , and contrasts with the delicacy of the pinnacled choir stalls , the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers , Clayton and Bell . The choir stalls , dating from about 1380 , are one of the glories of the cathedral . The aisles of the choir previously both extended on either side of the Lady Chapel . The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott , and given an apsidal east end , becoming the chapel of St Erasmus . The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh . The nave of six bays , and the large , aisled south transept were begun in about 1323 , probably to the design of Nicholas de Derneford . There are a number of windows containing fine Flowing Decorated tracery of this period . The work ceased in 1375 , in which year there was a severe outbreak of plague in England . The building of the nave was recommenced in 1485 , more than 150 years after it was begun . The architect was probably William Rediche . Remarkably , for an English medieval architect , he maintained the original form , changing only the details . The nave was roofed with a stellar vault rather like that of the Lady Chapel at Ely and the choir at York Minster , both of which date from the 1370s . Like that at York , the vault is of wood , imitating stone . = = = = Perpendicular Gothic = = = = From about 1493 until 1525 the architect appears to have been Seth Derwall , succeeded by George Derwall until 1537 . Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design , as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory . He also built the central tower , southwest porch and cloisters . Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508 , but it had not risen above the roofline at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries , and has never been completed . The central tower , rising to 127 feet ( 39 m ) , is a \u201c lantern tower \u201d with large windows letting light into the crossing . Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century . = = = Former monastic buildings = = = The Perpendicular Gothic cloister is entered from the cathedral through a Norman doorway in the north aisle . The cloister is part of the building programme that commenced in the 1490s and is probably the work of Seth Derwall . The south wall of the cloister , dating from the later part of the Norman period , forms the north wall of the nave of the cathedral , and includes blind arcading . Among the earliest remaining structures on the site is an undercroft off the west range of the cloisters , which dates from the early 12th century , and which was originally used by the monks for storing food . It consists of two naves with groin vaults and short round piers with round scalloped capitals . Leading from the south of the undercroft is the abbot 's passage which dates from around 1150 and consists of two bays with rib-vaulting . Above the abbot 's passage , approached by a stairway from the west cloister , is St Anselm 's Chapel which also dates from the 12th century . It is in three bays and has a 19th century Gothic-style plaster vault . The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17th century . The screen , altar rails , holy table and plaster ceiling of the chancel date from the 17th century . The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory , built by Simon de Whitchurch in the 13th century . It contains an Early English pulpit , approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade . The only other similar pulpit in England is in Beaulieu Abbey . = = = Restoration = = = By the 19th century the fabric of the building had become badly weathered , with Charles Hiatt writing that \" the surface rot of the very perishable red sandstone , of which the cathedral was built , was positively unsightly \" and that the \" whole place previous to restoration struck one as woebegone and neglected ; it perpetually seemed to hover on the verge of collapse , and yet was without a trace of the romance of the average ruin \" . Between 1818 and 1820 the architect Thomas Harrison restored the south transept , adding corner turrets . This part of the building served until 1881 as the parish church of St Oswald , and it was ecclesiastically separate . From 1844 R. C. Hussey carried out a limited restoration including work on the south side of the nave . The most extensive restoration was carried out by the Gothic Revival architect , George Gilbert Scott , who between 1868 and 1876 \" almost entirely re-cased \" the cathedral . The current building is acknowledged to be mainly the product of this Victorian restoration commissioned by the Dean , John Saul Howson . In addition to extensive additions and alterations to the body of the church , Scott remodelled the tower , adding turrets and crenellations . Scott chose sandstone from the quarries at Runcorn for his restoration work . In addition to the restoration of the fabric of the building , Scott designed internal fittings such as the choir screen to replace those destroyed during the Civil War . He built the fan vault of the south porch , renewed the wooden vault of the choir and added a great many decorative features to the interior . Scott 's restorations were not without their critics and caused much debate in architectural circles . Scott claimed to have archaeological evidence for his work , but the Liverpool architect , Samuel Huggins argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society , that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding . One of the larger changes was to shorten the south aisle and restyle it as an apse . The changes also proposed the addition of a spire above the existing tower , but this proposal was later rejected . Samuel 's further paper of 1871 entitled On so-called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism . The debate contributed to the establishment of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Later in the century , from 1882 , Arthur Blomfield and his son Charles made further additions and modifications , including restoring and reinstating the Shrine of St Werburgh . More work was carried out in the 20th century by Giles Gilbert Scott between 1891 and 1913 , and by F. H. Crossley in 1939 . = = = Bell tower = = = Towards the end of 1963 the cathedral bells , which were housed in the central tower , were in need of an overhaul and ringing was suspended . In 1965 the Dean asked George Pace , architect to York Minster , to prepare specifications for a new bell frame and for electrification of the clock and tolling mechanism . Due to structural difficulties and the cost of replacing the bells in the central tower it was advised that consideration should be given to building a detached bell and clock tower in the southeast corner of the churchyard . It was decided to proceed with that plan , and in 1969 an announcement was made that the first detached cathedral bell tower was to be erected since the building of the campanile at Chichester Cathedral in the 15th century . In February 1969 , nine of the ten bells in the central tower were removed to be recast by John Taylor & Co as a ring of twelve bells with a flat sixth . The new bells were cast in 1973 . Work on the new bell-tower began in February 1973 . Two old bells dating from 1606 and 1626 were left in the tower . On 26 February 1975 the bells were rung for the first time to celebrate the wedding of a member of the Grosvenor family . The official opening on 25 June 1975 was performed by the Duke of Gloucester . The belfry is known as the Dean Addleshaw Tower , after the dean of the cathedral responsible for its construction . The tower is built in concrete , faced with sandstone at its base . It is the first detached bell tower to be built for a cathedral in this country since the Reformation . Between the bell tower and the south transept is a garden in remembrance of the Cheshire Regiment ( originally the 22nd Regiment of Foot ) . = = Fittings and glass = = The treasures of Chester Cathedral are its rare fittings , specifically its choir stalls and the 17th-century furnishing of the bishop \u2019 s consistory court in the south tower , which is a unique survival . = = = Choir stalls = = = The choir stalls date from about 1380 . They have high , spiky , closely set canopies , with crocketed arches and spirelets . The stall ends have poppyheads and are rich with figurative carving . The stalls include 48 misericords , all but five of which are original , depicting a variety of subjects , some humorous and some grotesque . Pevsner states that they are \" one of the finest sets in the country \" , while Alec Clifton-Taylor calls them \u201c exquisite \u201d and says of the misericords that \u201c for delicacy and grace they surpass even those at Lincoln and Beverley \u201d . = = = Organ = = = In 1844 , an organ by Gray & Davison of London was installed in the cathedral , replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626 . The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876 , to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaill\u00e9-Coll . It was later moved to its present position at the front of the north transept . In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ , replacing the Cavaill\u00e9-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own . The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side . The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969 , when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist , Roger Fisher , was installed . Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool . = = = Stained glass = = = See Gallery below Chester suffered badly at the hands of the Parliamentary troops . As a consequence , its stained glass dates mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries and has representative examples the significant trends in stained glass design from the 1850s onwards . Of the earlier Victorian firms , William Wailes is the best represented , in the south aisle ( 1862 ) , as well as Hardman & Co. and Michael Connor . Glass from the High Victorian period is well represented by two leading London firms , Clayton and Bell and Heaton , Butler and Bayne . The Aesthetic style is represented by Charles Eamer Kempe . Early 20th century windows include several commemorating those who died in World War I. There are also several notable modern windows , the most recent being the refectory window of 2001 by Ros Grimshaw which depicts the Creation . The eight-light Perpendicular window of the west end contains mid-20th century glass representing the Holy Family and Saints , by W. T. Carter Shapland . Three modern windows in the south aisle , designed and made by Alan Younger to replace windows damaged in the Second World War . They were donated by the 6th Duke of Westminster to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the cathedral and contain the dates 1092 and 1992 to reflect the theme of \" continuity and change \" . = = Tour of features = = = = = Nave = = = The west end of the nave is dominated by an eight-light window in the Perpendicular Gothic style which almost fills the upper part of the west wall .

The stone nave pulpit was designed by the restorer R. C. Hussey and the lectern , dated 1876 , is by Skidmore . The mosaic floor of the tower bay was designed by Dean Howson and executed by Burke and Co . The same firm installed the mosaics which decorate the wall of the north aisle , depicting the patriarchs and prophets Abraham , Moses , David and Elijah . They were designed by J. R. Clayton of Clayton and Bell , and date from 1883 to 86 . Monuments in the nave include those to Roger Barnston , dated 1838 , by John Blayney , to Bishop Stratford , dated 1708 , to Bishop Hall who died in 1668 , to Edmund Entwistle , dated 1712 , to John and Thomas Wainwright who died respectively in 1686 and 1720 , to Robert Bickerstaff who died in 1841 by Blayney , to Dean Smith who died in 1787 by Thomas Banks , and to Sir William Mainwaring , dated 1671 . = = = Choir = = = The most famous feature of the choir is the set of choir stalls , dating from about 1380 , and described above .

It served as a chapel of ease to another church in the area , St Ceidio 's . Some restoration work was carried out in the 19th century , but St Mary 's has since fallen into disuse and is now largely in ruins . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because it is \" a late Medieval church of exceptionally simple character \" , and is virtually unaltered despite its poor condition . One writer has said that St Mary 's \" has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in Anglesey \" . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is in the countryside in Rhodogeidio , in Anglesey , north Wales . It is about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) north of Llannerch-y-medd , towards the north of Anglesey . It is reached by a footpath from a farm \u2013 it is only accessible on foot \u2013 and is surrounded by a churchyard . It was built in the 15th century as a chapel of ease to serve St Ceidio 's Church , Rhodogeidio , about 0.75 miles ( 1.25 km ) to the east . Restoration work was carried out in the 19th century , but the church later fell into disuse . It has been in ruins since sometime between 1937 , when the survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded its condition as \" fair \" , and 1970 , when it was given listed building status and its \" very poor \" condition noted . = = Architecture and fittings = = St Mary 's is a small church , measuring 30 feet by 12 feet 3 inches ( about 9.1 by 3.7 m ) . It dates from the late medieval period , and was constructed using rubble masonry and large stones . It had a slate roof , although most of the roof has now gone , and there is a bellcote at the west end , which may be original rather than a later addition . There is no physical division between the nave and the chancel , although one account in the 19th century said that there had originally been a screen separating them , and some traces of it still remained at that time . Entrance to the church was through a doorway with a square head , in the north wall at the west end ; this dates from the 19th century . An inscribed stone near the doorway has the date 1798 and some initials , and it has been suggested that this marked the date of some renovation work . There are two windows on the south wall , one fully blocked and one partially blocked . The small window at the east end of the church dates from the latter part of the 15th century . Inside , little remains , but the ruins still have most of the original roof trusses ( one , at the west end of the church , is a replacement ) . There are some slate memorial tablets on the walls , dating from the middle of the 19th century , and a plain 12th-century circular font . The 1937 survey noted a bell dating from 1717 and some portions of 17th-century panelled seating near the pulpit ; these were not recorded when the church was given listed status in 1970 . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 and has been listed because it is \" a late Medieval church of exceptionally simple character \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes that despite its \" very poor condition \" , St Mary 's \" is a virtually unaltered late Medieval building ( even retaining the original roof trusses ) and in its isolation , is characteristic of many churches on the island . \" Writing in 1859 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones called it a \" small , plain , single-aisled chapel \" , and said that one of the small south windows was \" a good specimen of its kind . \" A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that the \" roofless ruin \" of St Mary 's \" has the distinction of probably being the most isolated church in Anglesey \" .",

The date is written on a beam in the hall , and is also the date given by a local history of Pingyao county written in the 19th century . A stela written in 1819 also confirms this date . Wanfo Hall is the oldest building at Zhenguo temple , and is the only surviving building that dates from the short-lived Northern Han dynasty . Although little is known of the temple 's history , stelae record that it was renovated in 1540 and in 1816 .

It is a three-bay single-eaves hip and gabled hall that is nearly square in shape , measures 11.6 by 10.8 meters , and is 8.8 m high . Despite the building 's small size , and features that would identify it as a regular hall ( such as pillars that have been implanted directly into the floor instead of on a stone pedestal ) , the structure is quite complex . There are doors at the front and back of the hall . In addition , the front of the hall has two windows on either side of the door . There are twelve pillars supporting the structure . The corner and column-top brackets holding up the roof are of the 7th degree , one of the most complex and large types according to Yingzao Fashi . These bracket sets are nearly 2.5 meters high \u2013 70 % the height of the columns . Inter-columnar brackets that occur between every two pillars are of the 5th degree . The hall has no ceiling , and the upper and lower set of rafters are exposed . Nancy Steinhardt speculates that the complex brackets on what would have been a humble structure were an attempt by the Northern Han rulers to build a magnificent structure with limited resources . The hall contains eleven sculptures from the Northern Han period . These are the only Chinese sculptures from the period that survive from outside the Mogao Grottoes . There is a main statue of Sakyamuni flanked by Bodhisattvas and the Heavenly Kings .",

The site covers 3.63 hectares ( 9 acres ) and incorporates the walled garden , dovecote and coach house of Eastcote House . The house was demolished in 1964 by the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council ( RNUDC ) , the predecessor of the London Borough of Hillingdon . At the public 's request , the garden and outbuildings were retained and are now maintained by a group of volunteers , the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens , in partnership with the local authority . Eastcote House was one of three largest in Eastcote , together with Highgrove House and Haydon Hall . All came to be owned by the RNUDC , but only Highgrove House remains in its original form ; Haydon Hall was demolished in 1967 by the RNUDC 's successor . The coach house , dovecote , and garden walls received Grade II listed status on 6 September 1974 . Ecological surveys have found fifty types of trees in the gardens , and numerous species of birds , mammals and insects have been recorded . The gardens received the Green Flag Award in September 2011 following an earlier inspection . = = History = = = = = Eastcote House = = = Eastcote House is first recorded in 1507 , when it was known as \" Hopkyttes \" , under the ownership of the Walleston family . In 1525 , Ralph Hawtrey married Winifred Walleston , and they made Hopkyttes their marital home , renaming it Eastcote House . The house was extended by either Ralph Hawtrey or his son John , and the brick exterior added . The original timber framework was not revealed again until the house was demolished . John Hawtrey built the dovecote without applying for the required licence . After his death in 1593 , his nephew Ralph Hawtrey applied retrospectively , and the licence was granted . During the 18th century , the dovecote was substantially rebuilt , leaving only the original first few rows of bricks . The Hawtrey family , later the Hawtrey-Deanes , continued to live in the house until Francis Deane moved to East View in Uxbridge in 1878 . Eastcote House was then let to tenants and parts of the estate sold for housing developments . The Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council purchased the house and grounds , totalling 9.1 acres ( 3.7 ha ) , in 1931 after it became endangered by the proposed new housing development by the builders Comben & Wakeling . Eastcote House became a public building for the use of the Scouts , Guides , Women 's Institute and a welfare clinic , though under the ownership of the council , the condition of the house deteriorated . In 1962 the house was declared unsafe , and it was demolished two years later after the council ruled there were no features of the house worth retaining . The Eastcote Billiards Club began using the coach house in 1938 . The club 's lease of the building expired in 2005 , but the club remained in residence , rent-free . In 2013 , the club had moved to nearby Haydon Hall . = = = Gardens = = = The narrow bricks in the garden walls have been dated to around the 17th century . The walled garden would originally have been used predominantly for growing fruit , vegetables , and herbs for the household 's consumption , as well as flowers to exhibit at shows and for pleasure . The walled garden , coach house , and dovecote were retained at the public 's request when the house was demolished . On 6 September 1974 , the garden walls and remaining buildings were awarded Grade II listed status . The herb garden was planted across the four centre beds in 1977 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II . These included Artemisia , catmint , Santolina and curry plants . To keep the plants within the beds , each was lined by box in 1983 . The eastern wall was rebuilt in 1981 , at which point the northern wall was reduced by seven layers of brick . An area of topiary with seven specimens was planted in 1983 with box , behind the coach house . Lilacs , weeping cherries and hibiscus were planted in 1984 along the garden wall near the coach house . A pergola covered with laburnum and wisteria was introduced in 1986 leading to the entrance into the walled garden . Between 1986 and 1988 , two iron gates and a sundial were added . In the 1990s , the orchard near the walled garden was supplemented by black mulberry , walnut and quince trees . A footbridge crossing the River Pinn and leading to Long Meadow was replaced in 2007 ; the original had been built in 1977 . In 2008 , the Friends of Eastcote House Gardens was formed to care for the gardens and ensure they remain protected . The group received a \u00a3 24,000 grant from the Big Lottery Fund for the replanting of the gardens , which went ahead in April 2010 . The Mayor of Hillingdon officially reopened the gardens on 17 July 2010 . A survey completed in November 2009 found 50 types of trees in the gardens . Bats were found in the coach house during an ecological survey , but were not believed to be nesting there long-term . Species of birds observed in the gardens have included song thrush , jay , wren , robin , kingfisher and tawny owl . Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs , grey squirrels and foxes . Butterflies including the holly blue and painted lady have been recorded . Hillingdon Council provided a \u00a3 150,000 grant in September 2010 for the restoration of the buildings . In April 2011 , the council joined with the Friends to seek funding of up to \u00a3 1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund , to support restoration work . It is planned that the coach house could be converted into a tea room . The gardens received the Green Flag Award in 2011 following an earlier inspection . The flag was raised in a ceremony on 14 September 2011 .",

Constructed in 1901 and designed by Boston-based Allen & Vance , the brick dorm stands five stories tall . Lathrop houses 180 students who may be any grade or gender . = = History = = Lathrop House was the third residential quadrangle ( quad ) dormitory built on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893 \u2013 1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing \u2014 a single large hall in which all a college 's residents lived , in Vassar 's case Main Building \u2014 was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses . The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897 ; Lathrop followed in 1901 , and Davison House 's erection completed the quad in 1902 . Construction of the dorm was paid for with Vassar 's funds , unlike Strong House which had been paid for by a gift from John D. Rockefeller . The dormitory is named after Dr. Edward Lathrop , one of Vassar 's charter trustees , and carries the full name Edward Lathrop House . Lathrop 's daughter , Julia , was a graduate of the Vassar class of 1880 . In 1979 , the Intercultural Center , a multicultural student space , moved into Lathrop in spite of initial disagreement by members of the house two years earlier when the idea was first proposed . The Intercultural Center later moved out of Lathrop 's basement and into its own dedicated space in the early 1990s , at which point it was replaced by a Jewish co-op and kitchen . In 1995 , the Kosher Co-Op moved out of Lathrop and into a newly acquired Jewish house across the street from the college . = = Architecture and features = = Lathrop was designed by the Boston architectural firm of Francis Richmond Allen and J. McArthur Vance who were also responsible for the design of its neighbor , Davison House , in 1902 . Formulating a design for these two buildings was not difficult as a template had already been set by way of the preexisting Strong and Raymond Houses . Frederick Law Olmsted , a consultant of design for the college , recommended that any new dorms in the area be built in an \" echelon formation \" in order to provide for a greater sense of openness . Allen disregarded this advice , instead opting to place the dorm , along with Davison , in \" two long unbroken rows of buildings on the bias \" . Lathrop was ultimately placed north of Strong , across the quad to the east of Davison , and diagonally across from Raymond . Lathrop stands five stories tall with an additional basement level . The dormitory , Elizabethan in style , is a brick building with elements of brownstone trim . The roof is a Vermont slate and from it rise five chimneys , each built with two wythes of brick and capped with bluestone . There are also multiple cupolas that are framed with wood , include painted louvered slats , and have topped with a coat of terne . The building also has parapets , unlike neighboring Strong . The house is co-ed and currently has a capacity of 180 students . Students in Lathrop , which houses students of all grades , may live in either single rooms , one-room doubles , or three-room triples . Bathrooms are shared by all members of a hall .",

The bell was created for a church in Lake Geneva , Wisconsin as a replica of the Liberty Bell in 1862 . In 1910 , while it was being moved across the frozen Geneva Lake following a fire at the church , the ice cracked and the bell sank to the bottom of the lake . It was salvaged in 1960 and the village of Mount Morris acquired it in 1966 . The Illinois Freedom Bell is rung during the annual Let Freedom Ring festival , and it can be found beneath a gazebo on the village square . The bell has been credited with starting an Independence Day bell-ringing tradition across the United States . The bell was designated the official Illinois Freedom Bell in 1971 . = = History = = = = = Origin = = = The Illinois Freedom Bell is located in Mount Morris , Illinois , and was cast as a replica of the Liberty Bell in 1862 . Following its casting , the bell was transported to Lake Geneva , Wisconsin , where it was kept in the belfry of a church along the north shore of Geneva Lake . In 1910 , the church was destroyed by a fire ; the bell fell during the fire but was undamaged ; following the fire , the bell was put into storage . The church members then decided to reconstruct the church on the south side of the lake . During the winter , as a group of men attempted to drag the bell across the frozen lake , the weight of the bell cracked the ice and it sank to the bottom . The bell remained submerged for over 40 years before a wealthy resident of Lake Geneva decided to surface the bell in 1960 . The resident located the bell , and surfaced it with great difficulty , intent on making the future Illinois Freedom Bell the focal point of his new home . After the bell was salvaged he decided it did not suit his purposes . A young farmer from Johnsburg purchased the bell , and it was again kept in storage . In 1966 , an article was published about the bell 's submersion and resurfacing at Geneva Lake . The article interested the people of Mount Morris , Illinois , and they sent 12 members of their Fourth of July Committee to investigate the bell in Johnsburg . The people of Mount Morris decided to purchase the bell ; a committee was formed and obtained a loan from the Mount Morris VFW . The group also collected donations from local residents to purchase the bell for US $ 500 . By July 4 , 1966 , the Illinois Freedom Bell hung from the gazebo in its current location , and the two writers who first suggested bell ringing as an annual Independence Day ceremony , Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane were on hand for its dedication . Five years later , in 1971 , the bell was designated the Official Freedom Bell of the State of Illinois by Illinois Governor Richard B. Ogilvie . A plaque was added to the tower on July 4 , 1972 with an inscription from Governor Ogilvie that reads : = = = Festival = = = On February 17 , 1963 , an issue of This Week contained an article , \" Make Freedom Really Ring \" , written by two Connecticut writers , Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane . In the article , they suggested that every July 4 , all bells in the country ring for four minutes , and radio stations broadcast the ringing for two minutes . Readers across the country took the advice of the magazine 's editor , and contacted local officials in support of a nationwide bell-ringing observance . Concurrently , a resolution was proposed in Congress by Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff that called for the ringing of bells nationwide at 2 p.m every July 4 . Eastern Daylight Time . The bill passed both the Senate and House of Representatives later that year . Meanwhile , the village of Mount Morris had already decided to hold their own bell-ringing during the village 's annual Independence Day festival , the \" Let Freedom Ring \" . Subsequently , on April 30 , 1963 , Illinois native and rising Republican political star Ronald Reagan visited Mount Morris to dedicate the first Mount Morris freedom bell , which now hangs at the Veterans ' Memorial Fountain . The first freedom bell was a small 16 inch ( 40.6 cm ) bell . Later , as U.S. President in 1984 , Reagan was presented with a replica of the official Illinois Freedom Bell in the Oval Office by U.S. Representative Lynn Morley Martin . The first national bell-ringing took place on July 4 , 1963 ; Mount Morris also participated in that ringing . Even though many states sponsored bell-ringings , Hatch and Sloane both credited Mount Morris with making their suggestion a reality . The Illinois Freedom Bell is annually rung in unison , at 1 pm CDT ( 18 : 00 UTC ) on the Independence Day , July 4 , with other bells across the United States . Thousands of people gather in the village to hear the bell each year on Independence Day . In Mount Morris , the annual event is known as the Let Freedom Ring festival . The Mount Morris festival and bell ringing has been attended by several notable individuals . In 1973 , future Illinois Governor and member of the 9 / 11 Commission , James Thompson attended the festival and bell ringing . A year later , in 1974 , Richard Blake , a noted Abraham Lincoln impersonator , appeared at the festival to speak as Lincoln . Several times the Let Freedom Ring festival has been broadcast nationally . During the 1964 festival , Governor Otto Kerner was the speaker at the bell-ringing observance , and his address was transmitted via telephone to the Illinois pavilion at the 1964 New York World 's Fair . The 1965 bell-ringing was broadcast over the public address system at Wrigley Field in Chicago . Over the years , the committee for the festival requested that the bell-ringing be part of the Illinois Sesquicentennial , the U.S. Bicentennial , and the Statue of Liberty Centennial celebrations , all of which were allowed . The \" Let Freedom Ring \" celebration hosts a \" Freedom Run \" , arts and crafts , a parade , a fireworks display , and the highlighted ringing of the Illinois Freedom Bell . = = Description = = The Illinois Freedom Bell is silver in color and cast from bronze metal .

The Mahamuni Buddha image ( literal meaning : The Great Sage ) is deified in this temple , and originally came from Arakan . It is highly venerated in Burma and central to many people 's lives , as it is seen as an expression of representing the Buddha 's life . Ancient tradition refers to only five likenesses of the Buddha , made during his lifetime ; two were in India , two in paradise , and the fifth is the Mahamuni Buddha image in Myanmar . According to the legend , the Buddha visited the Dhanyawadi city of Arakan in 554 BC . King Sanda Thuriya requested that an image was cast of him . After casting the Great Image , the Buddha breathed upon it , and thereafter the image became the exact likeness of the Mahamuni . = = History = = = = = Origins = = = According to legend , the Gautama Buddha visited Dhanyawadi , the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a Proselytization mission to spread Buddhism . During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time , a devout Buddhist , the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town . The King of Arakan , along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala ( with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting ) , and an entourage of ministers , generals and officials , paid homage to the Buddha . They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi ( Sravasti ) , the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship . For this purpose , the Buddha then sat under a Bodhi tree for a week of meditation . During this time Sakka ( in P\u0101li , the ruler of the Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba Heaven in Buddhist cosmology , supported by his assistant Vissakamma , moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people . It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma ( or Vishvakarman ) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days . After looking at his own lifelike image , believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness , Buddha was pleased and \" imbued the image with his spiritual essence \" , or \" enlivened and consecrated \" the image , naming it \" Candasara \" . He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative . Historian Juliane Schober has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the \" living \" double image of Mahamuni Buddha : The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha ... The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously : they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology , and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma . Theravada politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha 's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image . The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains . Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed . These nine phenomena were : holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels ; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha 's head would retain its quality throughout the year ; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings ; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers ; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees ; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image ; birds would not fly over the temple ; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple . Another legend narrated is linked to the six Khmer bronze statues ( three lions \u2013 with heads substituted later in Burmese style , a three-headed elephant known as Airavata , and two warriors in the form of Shiva ) , which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard . These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia . Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases . = = = Image history = = = In the ancient history of Arakan , King Anawratha of Pagan ( r . 1044 \u2013 1077 ) attempted to move the image to Pagan , without success . In 1784 , the Burmese under the military leadership of Crown Prince Thado Minsaw of Konbaung dynasty conquered the Kingdom of Mrauk U. The religious relics of the kingdom , including the Mahamuni Buddha image , were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at Amarapura , on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay . As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole , it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple . Mandalay became the capital under King Mindon ( r . 1853 \u2013 1878 ) . It was also the capital under his son Thibaw ( r . 1878 \u2013 1885 ) of the Konbaung Dynasty ( 1752 \u2013 1885 ) . When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it , monarchic rule ended . However , veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued , and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims , mainly Rakhine , Mon and Burmans peoples . Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot . They were originally Khmer statues , found at Angkor Wat in Cambodia , and were taken to Ayutthaya in 1431 by the Siamese . In 1564 , the Burmese king Bayinnaung conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to Bago ( Pegu ) . In 1599 , King Razagri of Mrauk U invaded Bago and brought the statues to Mrauk U. Finally , Thado Minsaw took them to Amarapura in 1785 . According to local belief , many more of these statues were brought from Arakan . However , King Thibaw melted many of them to cast cannons for fortification of his palace . Of the thirty statues Bayinnaung brought from Siam , only six remain today , and are displayed in the temple complex . They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities . = = = Damage = = = The Mahamnuni image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884 . In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw , the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple , devotional halls , causeways and others were burnt down , although the Great Image itself was saved . Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image . In 1887 , Minister Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung took charge of the site and in1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya . In 1996 , the military rulers in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda . During this period , the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image . It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image . It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night , resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter . Whilst the meeting was in progress , attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl . A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all . It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired . However , the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all . = = Architecture = = = = = Main Temple / Pagoda = = = The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest . It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King Bodawpaya to the eastern gate of the temple , although only remnants of this road can still be seen . A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the Thudhamma Nikaya ( order ) , is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda . The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn . The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks , selling religious paraphernalia such as incense , candles , rosaries , flowers , robes , sandals etc . , and various restaurants and tea shops . The sanctum sanctorum , where the large Mahamuni image is deified , is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven pyatthat meaning tiered roofs ( derivative of the Sanskrit word prasada ) . The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering . The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes . = = = Mahamuni image = = = The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a small chamber , seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the Bhumisparsa Mudra . This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha 's vanquishing of Mara ) . The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards , and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically , as a witness of his past deeds . The image is cast in bronze and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a 1.84 metres ( 6.0 ft ) high pedestal and reaches a height of 3.82 metres ( 12.5 ft ) . Its shoulders measure 1.84 metres ( 6.0 ft ) and its waist measures 2.9 metres ( 9.5 ft ) . It is draped in royal costumes with \" Brahmanic cords ( salwe ) and regalia crossing his chest \" . The image is crowned , bejewelled with diamonds , rubies and sapphires . The left hand appears imprecise , unusually large , and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm . Gold leaves are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees . Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves , the coating of gold ( thickness 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) ) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image . However , it is also noted that the right hand , crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering , which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni . In 1884 , when the pagoda was burnt down , 91 kilograms ( 201 lb ) of gold was recovered from the site , which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni . = = = Other features = = = A large number of ' inscription stones ' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard . These inscriptions , some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone , have been collected from many regions of the country . There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with rice cakes by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day . Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum , which contains displays of Buddhism throughout Asia . = = Daily rituals = = On February 17 , 1988 , the present Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn . This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4 : 30 am when monks wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image . It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire , assisted by several lay helpers , dressed in white and wearing formal headdress . As soon as the drums are struck , the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels , offered by devotees . He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni 's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels . After this , sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water . After the ceremony is completed , the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines . On special occasions , such as Uposatha day , an orange stoll is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned . A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals ; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer . Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed . During the winter season , the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order . During the reign of Burmese monarchs , offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way . Food and other offerings , sheltered by a Royal white umbrella , were taken in a procession from the palace , escorted by a Minister , as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state . = = Festival = = A major annual pagoda festival known as the ' Mahamuni Paya Pwe ' ( ' pwe ' meaning \" festival \" ) is held in early February , at the end of the Buddhist Lent to celebrate the history of the pagoda . During this festival , aside from the daily rituals , the Patthana from a \" Book of Conditional Relations \" is recited . This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in Tavatimsa heaven and is a sacred scripture in the Pali language . The Pattana recitation is a special feature , which continues for several days . Monks recite from the scriptures , in groups of two or three . The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance , music , theatre etc . , and there is also a social event , allowing families and friends gather to greet each other . Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season , guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it . = = Gallery = =",

                    "text": "Australian Army during World War II = The Australian Army was the largest service in the Australian military during World War II . Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army was split into the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Following the outbreak of war , on 14 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force ( Second AIF ) , would be formed for overseas service . Meanwhile , conscription was introduced in October 1939 to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . The Australian Army subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 . Following the Japanese surrender Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces across the South West Pacific . Meanwhile , the Army contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan from 1946 . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions , and in August 1942 the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force was larger than Australia 's population and economy could sustain , and its strength was reduced in the second half of the year . Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed , but few did so . The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943 . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 . These units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles . This organisation proved only moderately successful , and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns . The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947 . A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war , a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population . Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . As a proportion of its population , the Australian Army was ultimately one of the largest Allied armies during World War II . Casualties included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 who died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . Another 5,558 were killed or died as prisoners of war ( POWs ) , while non-battle casualties in operational areas were also significant and included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded or injured . In addition , the Army suffered a substantial number of casualties in non-operational areas : 1,795 soldiers killed and 121,800 wounded or injured . = = Background = = Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army consisted of the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Throughout the inter-war years , a combination of complacency and economic austerity had resulted in limited defence spending . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , conscription was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Militia would be maintained on a part-time , voluntary basis only . The size of the Army remained small up until 1938 and 1939 when the Militia was rapidly expanded as the threat of war grew . In 1938 , there had been only 35,000 soldiers in the Militia , but by September 1939 this had been increased to 80,000 , supported by a PMF of 2,800 full-time soldiers whose main responsibility was largely to administer and train the Militia . This expansion had little impact on improving the readiness of Australian forces upon the outbreak of the war , though , as the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 restricted the pre-war Army to service in Australia and its territories including Papua and New Guinea . As a result , when Australia entered the war in 1939 , a new all-volunteer force was required that could fight in Europe or elsewhere outside of Australia 's immediate region . ( Similarly , in World War I the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force ( First AIF ) was raised and served with distinction at Gallipoli , in the Middle East and on the Western Front . ) From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by the \" Singapore strategy \" , which centred on the establishment of a major naval base at Singapore and the use of naval forces to respond to any future Japanese aggression in the region . As a maritime strategy , it resulted in a defence budget that was focused on building up the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , in order to support the British Royal Navy . Between 1923 and 1929 , \u00a3 20,000,000 was spent on the RAN , while the Australian Army and the munitions industry received only \u00a3 10,000,000 and the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) just \u00a3 2,400,000 . The strategy met significant political opposition from sections of the regular Army , including several prominent officers such as Henry Wynter and John Lavarack . Wynter in particular argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe and would be unable to send sufficient resources to Singapore . He contended that Singapore was vulnerable , especially to attack from the land and the air , and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN . During the 1930s the Australian Army 's organisation , equipment and doctrine were similar to those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports . While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan , little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia 's eastern seaboard , along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia . The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s , but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations due to a lack of resources as a result of limited defence expenditures . Nevertheless , the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war , and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service . In 1942 the Army adopted the title Australian Military Forces ( AMF ) to encompass the various categories of service : AIF , Militia and Permanent Forces . Wartime exigencies required a rapid expansion of the Army and during the war 730,000 personnel enlisted in either the Militia or the AIF , a figure which represented around 10 percent of Australia 's population of just seven million , one of the highest percentages of any of the Allied armies during World War II . It subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 as part of British Commonwealth forces , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 primarily in conjunction with forces from the United States . Nearly 400,000 men served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . = = Organisation = = = = = Origin of the Second Australian Imperial Force = = = Australia entered World War II on 3 September 1939 . On 14 September Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force , would be formed for overseas service . Like its predecessor , the Second AIF was a volunteer force formed by establishing entirely new units . In many cases these units drew their recruits from the same geographical areas as First AIF units , and they were given the same numerical designations albeit with the prefix \" 2 / \" . In October 1939 , conscription was introduced to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . From January 1940 , all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service . While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military , the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service . A side effect of this arrangement was the creation of two different armies with different conditions of service , one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF . This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war , as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces . Later , provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service . This required 65 percent of a unit 's war establishment \u2014 or 75 percent of its actual strength \u2014 to volunteer and allowed whole battalions to become part of the AIF . An early problem was whether to adopt the British or Australian organisation . In 1939 the British Army was in the process of re-equipping with new weapons , and a new organisation was required . This new equipment was not available in Australia , so it was decided to organise the first unit to be raised \u2014 the 6th Division \u2014 with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new . Consequently , the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel , and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies , a battalion headquarters , regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals , mortars , carriers , pioneers , anti-aircraft and administration . Artillery support was provided by three field regiments , each attached at brigade-level , as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles . Corps troops included a machine-gun battalion , and various engineer , logistics and communication units . Three further AIF infantry divisions were formed during 1940 : the 7th Division in February 1940 , the 8th Division in May and the 9th Division in June . However , the establishment of these divisions was reduced to the new nine-battalion organisation as the size of an Australian division was reduced to approximately 17,000 men , and the three surplus battalions of the 6th Division became part of the 7th Division . Further changes included the addition of a light anti-aircraft regiment at divisional level , and a reorganisation of the divisional artillery from three four-battery regiments consisting of 16 guns to three two-battery regiments of 12 guns . An AIF corps headquarters , designated I Corps , was formed in March 1940 along with various support units . The 1st Armoured Division , the final AIF division to be formed , was established in July 1941 , built around a core of two armoured brigades each consisting of three tank-equipped armoured regiments , supported by motorised cavalry , armoured cars , engineers and artillery . Several units , such as Z and M Special Units , were also raised for irregular warfare as were 12 commando companies . Many corps , support and service units were also raised during the war to provide combat and logistical support . = = = Forces in Australia and the Pacific = = = The Army 's command and administrative arrangements at the start of the war were based on a system of military districts that had existed since Federation , albeit with a number of modifications . Australia was divided into six military districts each of which largely equated to a State or Territory , and reported to the Department of the Chief of the General Staff . Meanwhile , the Military Board was responsible for the administration of the Army , with regular members consisting of the Deputy Adjutant-General , the Chief of Intelligence , the Chief of the General Staff , the Chief of Ordnance and a civilian Finance Member , in addition to a number of consultative members , under the overall control of the Minister of the Defence . The 1st Military District ( 1 MD ) encompassed Queensland , the 2nd included most of New South Wales , the 3rd was primarily based on Victoria , the 4th included South Australia , the 5th included Western Australia and the 6th encompassed forces in Tasmania . In 1939 the Northern Territory was designated the 7th Military District , while and the 8th Military District was later activated in Port Moresby to command forces in New Guinea . Following the outbreak of World War II a regional command structure was subsequently adopted , with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command , 5 MD redesignated Western Command , while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales , Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command . In the early years of the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas ; however , as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure . The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan 's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation . In response , the Army command structure was reorganised in early 1942 . While Western Australia remained unchanged , Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas , 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force . In July 1942 the Military Board 's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces , General Sir Thomas Blamey . The AIF 's requirements for manpower and equipment constrained the Militia during the early years of the war . At the outbreak of the Pacific War the main Army units in Australia were five Militia infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th Divisions \u2014 two Militia cavalry divisions \u2014 the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions \u2014 and the AIF 1st Armoured Division . The Volunteer Defence Corps ( VDC ) , which was a part-time volunteer force of 100,000 men based on the British Home Guard , was also available for local defence . In addition , by early 1942 there were 12,000 garrison force personnel \u2014 mostly reservist veterans of World War I \u2014 organised into 13 garrison battalions for coastal defence and five battalions and two companies for internal security tasks , including guarding prisoner of war camps . Yet at this time only 30 percent of Militia units were on full-time duty , with the remainder periodically undertaking three month-long mobilisations . The Militia was also poorly armed , and there was insufficient equipment to be issued to all units if they were mobilised . In response to the Japanese threat following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the capture of the 8th Division in Malaya , the condition of the Militia became a pressing concern , after largely having been ignored since 1940 . Several middle-ranking and senior officers of the AIF were subsequently posted to Militia units and formations to give them experience . Meanwhile , the Army was forced to move units between Militia divisions so that the most combat-ready could be sent to areas believed to be under the greatest threat of attack . Some battalions were amalgamated , and although some were later separated and reformed , others were disbanded altogether . After the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed Militia units were able to serve outside Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 , though the 11th Brigade was the only major formation to do so . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th , 9th , 10th , 11th and 12th Divisions \u2014 and three armoured divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd and 3rd \u2014 organised into the First and Second Armies , and I , II and III Corps , as well as many support and service units . In August 1942 , the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force proved larger than what Australia 's population and industry could sustain ; by late 1942 the number of personnel who needed to be inducted each month to make good losses caused by sickness and combat was much larger than the numbers who were becoming eligible for service , and the allocation of a high proportion of Australia 's limited supply of manpower to the military was inhibiting the expansion of the munitions industry and other key sectors of the economy . The Army was also unbalanced as a large majority its personnel were employed in arms corps undertaking combat and combat support roles . Heavily reliant upon its allies for logistical support , it required more personnel in support arms such as ordnance and transport to be functional as a self-sufficient organisation . This situation was most acute in 1942 ; at that time there were 137,236 men serving arms corps such as infantry , cavalry and armour , while there were just 29,079 in ordnance . This imbalance was slowly addressed after 1942 as the Army 's size was reduced . Most of the units that were disbanded were Militia arms corps units , and by September 1943 the AIF outnumbered the Militia , having 265,000 members compared to just over 117,000 . Further reductions came in October 1943 when the Army 's strength was further reduced by 100,000 men to free up manpower to work in industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . By 1945 the support arms had grown considerably as a proportion of the total force and by August 1945 ordnance and the electrical and mechanical engineers totalled 42,835 men , while the artillery had been reduced to half its previous strength . Infantry , cavalry and armoured corps personnel numbered just 62,097 men , while engineers , signals and the medical services remained the same , albeit as part of a much smaller Army . Regardless , at the end of the war it remained one of the largest Allied armies as a proportion of population , being second only to the Soviet Union . The VDC was also reduced in size in May 1944 , and was finally disbanded on 24 August 1945 . If the conflict had continued past August 1945 , the size of the Army would have been further reduced to three divisions once Bougainville , New Guinea and New Britain had been secured . Two of these divisions would have been used on garrison duties , while a brigade group may have been made available for British-led operations in South East Asia and the remaining division was to take part in the invasion of Japan . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed . The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry . These large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 , reducing the authorised strength of the division by about 4,000 men . Each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as the anti-aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level . The amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced , but the conditions that the organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful . As a result , the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns by returning the artillery and anti-tank units that had been removed . The creation of the jungle divisions represented the first time in the Australian Army 's history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for the conditions in which its forces would fight . Previously force structure had been heavily influenced by the British Army , and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence . Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier force structure , as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on the previous scales of equipment and manning . Ultimately , while their structure was better suited to operations in Australia , they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese . As a result , the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised , while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties . The Army also raised many anti-aircraft and coastal defence units during the war . The pre-war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939 , and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea in response to the threat of Japanese attack . Australia had a limited capacity to produce anti-aircraft guns , and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain . As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment . The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944 . The Army had few anti-aircraft guns at the outbreak of war , and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities . By 1942 anti-aircraft batteries were in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia . The expansion of the artillery in general , and coastal defence and anti-aircraft units in particular , meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen . VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and anti-aircraft defences as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded . Traditionally the Australian Army had relied on its major allies to provide logistic support , primarily raising combat units rather than support arms during times of conflict . Consequently , these services were relatively underdeveloped , and they remained so during the first years of the war . While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941 , the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war . As a result , the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic , including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining . These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships , food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas . In addition , with Australia 's national support base located well to the rear , in the major cities in the south-east of the country , significant expansion of the Army 's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea . Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia , while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft . = = = Women 's services = = = Prior to World War II the Australian Army Nursing Service ( AANS ) was the only female branch of the Army . A reserve formation that had served overseas during World War I , the AANS was mobilised following the outbreak of war in 1939 and its Matron in Chief , Grace Wilson , served on the staff of the Director-General of Medical Services , Major General Rupert Downes . For most of the war , AANS nurses were the only Australian servicewomen permitted to serve overseas , and many volunteered for the AIF . These women served in all the major theatres in which the Army fought and a total of 71 were killed on active service . The majority of these died in early 1942 during the fighting in Malaya and Singapore where 41 nurses were killed . In March 1942 , the Volunteer Aid Detachments ( VADs ) also became a branch of the Army Medical Service . Consisting of volunteers originally coordinated by the Australian Red Cross and Order of Saint John , the VADs were redesignated the Australian Army Medical Women 's Service ( AAMWS ) in December 1942 , and were employed in military hospitals in Australia and overseas until after the end of the war , before returning to civilian control in 1948 . Shortages of manpower also led to the establishment of the Australian Women 's Army Service ( AWAS ) in August 1941 . AWAS members filled a wide range of roles to allow the Army to redeploy male soldiers to fighting units . While they mainly worked in clerical and administrative positions , and auxiliary roles such as drivers and signallers , many served in anti-aircraft batteries , operating radars and searchlights but not the guns themselves . While Blamey sought to have members of the AWAS posted overseas from early 1941 onwards , the Australian Government did not agree to this until 1945 . As a result , only about 400 of the 24,000 women who joined the AWAS served outside Australia . The AWAS was reduced in size following the war , and was finally disbanded on 30 June 1947 . Colonel Sybil Irving commanded the AWAS from September 1941 until 1947 . In total some 35,000 women served in the Army , making up about 5 percent of the force . = = Campaigns = = = = = North Africa = = = During the first years of World War II , Australia 's military strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom 's imperial defence policy . The Singapore strategy , which seemingly negated the need for large-scale land forces in the Pacific , was a key component of this policy and consequently most Australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed an integral part of the Commonwealth forces in the area . The three AIF infantry divisions dispatched to the Middle East were subsequently heavily involved in the fighting that followed . In addition to the force which was sent to North Africa , two AIF brigades ( the 18th and 25th ) were stationed in Britain from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings . An Australian Army forestry group also served in Britain between 1940 and 1943 . The Australian Army first saw action in Operation Compass , the successful Commonwealth offensive in North Africa which was conducted between December 1940 and February 1941 . Although the 6th Division was not fully equipped , it had completed its training and on 14 December , it relieved the 4th Indian Division . Given the task of capturing Italian fortresses bypassed by the British 7th Armoured Division during its advance , on 3 January , the division went into action at Bardia . Although the fortress was manned by a larger force , the Australian infantry quickly penetrated the Italian defensive lines with the support of British tanks and artillery . The majority of the defenders surrendered on 5 January and the Australians took 40,000 prisoners . The 6th Division followed up this success by assaulting the fortress of Tobruk on 21 January , securing it the next day and taking 25,000 Italians prisoner . After this , the Australians pushed west along the coast road to Cyrenaica and captured Benghazi on 4 February . Later that month , the 6th Division was withdrawn for deployment to Greece and was replaced by the untested 9th Division , which took up garrison duties in Cyrenaica . In the last week of March 1941 , a German-led force launched an offensive in Cyrenaica . The Allied forces in the area were rapidly forced to withdraw towards Egypt . The 9th Division formed the rear guard of this withdrawal , and on 6 April was ordered to defend the important port town of Tobruk for at least two months . Sustained by the Australian destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet , during the ensuing siege the 9th Division , reinforced by the 7th Division 's 18th Brigade as well as British artillery and armoured regiments , used fortifications , aggressive patrolling and artillery to contain and defeat repeated German armoured and infantry attacks . In September and October 1941 , upon the request of the Australian Government , the 9th Division was relieved and the bulk withdrawn from Tobruk . The 2 / 13th Battalion , however , was forced to remain until the siege was lifted in December as the convoy evacuating it was attacked . The defence of Tobruk cost the Australian units involved 3,009 casualties , including 832 killed and 941 taken prisoner . = = = Greece , Crete and Lebanon = = = In early 1941 the 6th Division and I Corps headquarters took part in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion . The corps ' commander , Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey , and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky , but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat . The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans . Australian troops arrived in Greece during March and manned defensive positions in the north of the country alongside British , New Zealand and Greek units . The outnumbered Allied force was not able to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6 April and was forced to retreat . The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and were evacuated from southern Greece between 24 April and 1 May . Australian warships also formed part of the force which protected the evacuation and embarked hundreds of soldiers from Greek ports . The 6th Division suffered heavy casualties in this campaign , with 320 men killed and 2,030 captured . While most of the 6th Division returned to Egypt , the 19th Brigade Group and two provisional infantry battalions landed at Crete where they formed a key part of the island 's defences . The 19th Brigade was initially successful in holding its positions when German paratroopers landed on 20 May , but was gradually forced to retreat . After several key airfields were lost the Allies evacuated the island 's garrison . Approximately 3,000 Australians , including the entire 2 / 7th Battalion , could not be evacuated , and were taken prisoner . As a result of its heavy casualties the 6th Division required substantial reinforcements and equipment before it was again ready for combat . The 7th Division , reinforced by the 6th Division 's 17th Brigade , formed a key part of the Allied ground forces during the Syria \u2013 Lebanon campaign which was fought against Vichy French forces in June and July 1941 . With close air support from the RAAF and the Royal Air Force , the Australian force entered Lebanon on 8 June and advanced along the coast road and Litani River valley . Although little resistance had been expected , the Vichy forces mounted a strong defence which made good use of the mountainous terrain . After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian I Corps headquarters took command of the operation on 18 June . These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces and the 7th Division entered Beirut on 12 July . The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the Vichy commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13 July . = = = El Alamein = = = In the second half of 1941 the Australian I Corps was concentrated in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East . Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps , including the 6th and 7th Divisions , returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia . The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain 's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73 squadrons . The Government did not intend that the 9th Division would play a major role in active fighting , and it was not sent any further reinforcements . In mid-1942 , the Axis forces defeated the Commonwealth force in Libya and advanced into north-west Egypt . In June the British Eighth Army made a stand just over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) west of Alexandria , at the railway siding of El Alamein and the 9th Division was brought forward to reinforce this position . The lead elements of the division arrived at El Alamein on 6 July and it was assigned the most northerly section of the Commonwealth defensive line . From that position , the 9th Division subsequently played a significant role in the First Battle of El Alamein , helping to halt the Axis advance . Casualties were heavy , and the 2 / 28th Battalion was forced to surrender on 27 July when it was surrounded by German armour after capturing Ruin Ridge . Following this battle the division remained at the northern end of the El Alamein line and launched diversionary attacks during the Battle of Alam el Halfa in early September . In October 1942 , the 9th Division and the RAAF squadrons in the area took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein . After a lengthy period of preparation , the Eighth Army launched its major offensive on 23 October . The 9th Division was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle , and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2nd New Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1 / 2 November . The 9th Division suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces . During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as it was not possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain it , and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November . The 9th Division left Egypt for Australia in January 1943 , ending the AIF 's involvement in the war in North Africa . = = = Malaya and Singapore = = = Due to the emphasis placed on cooperation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940 . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941 , while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island . An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul , and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon . Meanwhile , in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain in order to protect the airfield , while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland , Vila in the New Hebrides , Tulagi on Guadalcanal , Buka Passage in Bougainville , and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers . In December 1941 the Australian Army in the Pacific consisted of the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia , including the 1st Armoured Division . In keeping with the Singapore strategy , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . At the outbreak of war the Australian forces in Malaya consisted of two brigade groups from the 8th Division \u2014 the 22nd and 27th Brigades \u2014 under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett , along with four RAAF squadrons and eight warships . Following the Japanese invasion on 8 December 1941 , the 8th Division and its attached Indian Army units was assigned responsibility for the defence of Johore in the south of Malaya . As a result , it did not see action until mid-January 1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state , having pushed back the British and Indian units defending the northern parts of the peninsula . By this time , the division 's two brigades had been split up , with the 22nd having been deployed around Mersing and Endau on the east coast and the 27th in the west . The division 's first engagement came on the west coast around Muar on 14 January , where the Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian 45th Brigade was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas . While the Commonwealth forces in Johore achieved a number of local tactical victories , most notably around Gemas , Bakri and Jemaluang , they were unable to do more than slow the Japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties in doing so . After being outmanoeuvred by the Japanese , the remaining Commonwealth units withdrew to Singapore on the night of 30 \u2013 31 January . Following this the 8th Division was deployed to defend Singapore 's north-west coast . Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division 's units were at half-strength , and the replacements that had been received \u2014 a draft of about 1,900 replacements was sent in late January \u2014 were barely trained , some having as little as two weeks ' training in Australia before being dispatched . Assigned larger-than-normal frontages to defend along beaches that were ill-suited for defence , the 22nd and 27th Brigades were spread thin on the ground with large gaps in their lines . The commander of the Singapore fortress , Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival , believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector . Nevertheless , on 8 February the Japanese landed in the Australian sector , and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting . A subsequent landing took place at Kranji , but the division was unable to turn this back and subsequently withdrew to the centre of the island . After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore , Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February . Although some Australians were able to escape , following the capitulation 14,972 Australians were taken prisoner . Bennett was among those that managed to get out , having left the island the night before the surrender via sampan after handing over command of his division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan . He later justified his actions saying that he had gained an understanding of how to defeat the Japanese and needed to return to Australia to pass his knowledge on , but two post-war inquiries found that he was unjustified in leaving his command . The loss of almost a quarter of Australia 's overseas soldiers and the failure of the Singapore strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain , stunned the country . The fall of Singapore raised fears of a Japanese invasion of the Australian mainland and the Government became concerned about the Army 's ability to respond . Although large , the forces in Australia contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility . In response , most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Australian Prime Minister , John Curtin , appealed to the United States for assistance . As Japanese forces advanced through Burma towards India in early 1942 , the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions while they were en route to Australia , but Curtin refused to authorise this movement . As a compromise the 16th and 17th Brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island 's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942 . = = = Netherlands East Indies and Rabaul = = = While Australia 's contribution to the pre-war plans to defend South East Asia from Japanese aggression was focused on the defence of Malaya and Singapore , small Australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to the north of Australia . The role of these forces was to defend strategic airfields which could be used to launch attacks on the Australian mainland . Detachments of coastwatchers were also stationed in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands to report on any Japanese operations there . At the start of the Pacific War the strategic port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by \" Lark Force \" , which comprised the 2 / 22nd Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron . While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military , it was not possible to reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942 . The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle . Few members of Lark Force survived the war , as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057 Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan , the transport Montevideo Maru , was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942 . AIF troops were also dispatched from Darwin to the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) in the first weeks of the Pacific War . Reinforced battalions from the 8th Division 's third brigade , the 23rd , were sent to Koepang in West Timor as part of \" Sparrow Force \" and to the island of Ambon as \" Gull Force \" to defend these strategic locations from Japanese attack . The 2 / 2nd Independent Company was also sent to Dili in Portuguese Timor in violation of Portugal 's neutrality . The force at Ambon was defeated by the Japanese landing on 30 January and surrendered on 3 February 1942 . Over 300 Australian prisoners were subsequently killed by Japanese troops in a series of mass executions during February . While the force at Koepang was defeated after the Japanese landed there on 20 February and also surrendered , Australian commandos waged a guerrilla campaign against the Japanese in Portuguese Timor until February 1943 . In the lead-up to the Japanese invasion of Java a force of 242 carrier- and land-based aircraft attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942 . At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI . The Japanese attack was successful , and resulted in the deaths of 251 civilians and military personnel , most of whom were non-Australian Allied seamen , and heavy damage to RAAF Base Darwin and the town 's port facilities . A 3,000-strong Army unit , as well as several Australian warships and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March 1942 . An Army force made up of elements from the 7th Division also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command ( ABDACOM ) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12 March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate . Following the conquest of the NEI , the Japanese Navy 's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean , attacking Ceylon in early April . The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon at the time of the raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate . = = = Defence of Australia = = = Japan 's rapid advance south had been unexpected , and the perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military . By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions , three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units . Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps , which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively . However , Australia 's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed , and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 . Despite Australian fears , the Japanese never intended to invade the Australian mainland . While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942 , it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military 's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken . Instead , in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa and New Caledonia . Yet this plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway . While these battles ended the threat to Australia , the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943 . A series of Japanese air raids against northern Australia occurred during 1942 and 1943 , and while the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters , a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries were also involved in dealing with this threat . Meanwhile , in 1942 the Australian military was reinforced by units recalled from the Middle East and an expansion of the Militia and RAAF . United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea , and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander , General Douglas MacArthur . After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942 , with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943 . From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations , but continued to conduct large-scale operations until the end of the war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time . = = = Papuan campaign = = = Japanese forces first landed on the mainland of New Guinea on 8 March 1942 when they invaded Lae and Salamaua to secure bases for the defence of the important base they were developing at Rabaul . In response , Australian guerrillas from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles established observation posts around the Japanese beachheads and the 2 / 5th Independent Company successfully raided Salamaua on 29 June . After the Battle of the Coral Sea frustrated the Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby via an amphibious landing , they attempted to capture the town by landing Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii 's South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of Papua and advancing overland using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range . The Kokoda Track campaign began on 22 July when the Japanese began their advance , opposed by an ill-prepared Militia brigade designated \" Maroubra Force \" . This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force but was unable to halt it . In late August and early September 1942 Australian forces at Milne Bay inflicted the first notable land defeat of the war upon the Japanese . After the Japanese landed a unit of Special Naval Landing Forces to capture the airbases that the Allies had established in the area , two brigades of Australian troops \u2014 the Militia 7th and AIF 18th \u2014 designated \" Milne Force \" , supported by two RAAF fighter squadrons and US Army engineers , launched a counter-attack . Outnumbered , lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties , the Japanese were forced to withdraw . The victory helped raise Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre , especially on the Kokoda Track where the Japanese had continued to make progress throughout August . On 26 August two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force but the Japanese continued to advance along the Kokoda Track and by 16 September they reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby . After several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses , the Japanese troops were within 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) of Port Moresby . Yet supply problems made any further advance impossible , and the Japanese began to fear an Allied counter-landing at Buna . Following reverses at the hands of US forces on Guadalcanal the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided they could not support fronts on both New Guinea and Guadalcanal . Horii was subsequently ordered to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided . After this , the Australian forces were heavily reinforced by the 7th Division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit , often forcibly , to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel , the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track . In early November , they had been forced into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua . Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 . The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32nd Infantry Division , and was short of artillery and supplies . Due to a lack of supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey 's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications . These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943 . Throughout the fighting in Papua , most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered . In response , for the remainder of the war Australian soldiers generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel and aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents including some that had surrendered . Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea . Meanwhile , during the fighting in 1942 \u2013 43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the Japanese in jungle warfare . The Papuan campaign led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army . During the campaign , the restriction banning Militia personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and Militia . In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943 . This made deploying the Militia easier , but ultimately only one brigade , the 11th , was dispatched outside of Australian territory , being deployed to Merauke on the south coast of Dutch West Papua in the NEI during 1943 and 1944 as part of \" Merauke Force \" . = = = New Guinea offensives = = = After halting the Japanese advance , Allied forces went on the offensive across the SWPA from mid-1943 . Australian forces played a key role throughout this offensive , which was designated Operation Cartwheel . In particular , Blamey oversaw a series of highly successful operations around the north-east tip of New Guinea which \" was the high point of Australia 's experience of operational level command \" during the war . After the successful defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943 . This advance was mounted to divert attention from Lae , which was one of the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel , and proceeded slowly . In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team , which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua . The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943 . In early September 1943 Australian-led forces mounted a pincer movement to capture Lae . On 4 September the 9th Division made an amphibious landing to the east of the town and began advancing to the west . The following day , the US 503rd Parachute Regiment made an unopposed parachute drop at Nadzab , just west of Lae . Once the airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield , the 7th Division was flown in and began advancing to the east in a race with the 9th Division to capture Lae . This race was won by the 7th Division , which captured the town on 15 September . The Japanese forces at Salamaua and Lae suffered heavy losses during this campaign , but were able to escape to the north . After the fall of Lae the 9th Division was given the task of capturing the Huon Peninsula . The 20th Brigade landed near the strategic harbour of Finschhafen on 22 September 1943 and secured the area . The Japanese responded by dispatching the 20th Division overland to the area and the remainder of the 9th Division was gradually brought in to reinforce the 20th Brigade against the expected counter-attack . The Japanese mounted a strong attack in mid-October which was defeated by the 9th Division after heavy fighting . During the second half of November the 9th Division captured the hills inland of Finschhafen from well dug in Japanese forces . Following its defeat , the 20th Division retreated along the coast with the 9th Division and 4th Brigade in pursuit . While the 9th Division secured the coastal region of the Huon Peninsula the 7th Division drove the Japanese from the inland Finisterre Range . The Finisterre Range campaign began on 17 September when the 2 / 6th Independent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley . The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly in the division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack on the key Shaggy Ridge position . The ridge was taken by the end of the month , with the RAAF playing a key supporting role . Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21 April and secured Madang on 24 April . = = = Advance to the Philippines = = = The Australian military 's role in the South-West Pacific decreased during 1944 as US forces took over responsibility for the main Allied effort in the region . In the latter half of 1943 the Australian Government decided , with MacArthur 's agreement , that the size of the military would be decreased to release manpower for war-related industries which were important to supplying Britain and US forces in the Pacific . Australia 's main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food , materials and manufactured goods needed for the defeat of Japan . As a result of this policy , the size of the Army was reduced from late 1943 onwards , though an offensive force of six infantry divisions ( three AIF and three Militia divisions ) was maintained until the end of the war . In early 1944 all but two of the Army 's divisions were withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland for training and rehabilitation . However , several new battalions of Australian-led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the Pacific Islands Regiment . These troops had earlier seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign , and they largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year . While the Australian Government offered I Corps for use in Leyte and Luzon , nothing came of several proposals to utilise it in the liberation of these islands . The Army 's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern , and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if it could not be used for offensive operations . This was politically embarrassing for the government , and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be used . It also impacted upon the Army 's morale ; as the Allies advanced further towards Japan , the Army was increasingly relegated to \" second string \" roles , despite having fought \" above its weight \" for most of the war . = = = Mopping up in New Guinea and the Solomons = = = In late 1944 , the Australian Government committed twelve Australian Army brigades to replace six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville , New Britain and the Aitape \u2013 Wewak area in New Guinea in order to free up the American units for operations in the Philippines . While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions , their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas . The value of these campaigns was controversial at the time and remains so to this day as the Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political , rather than military , reasons . It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia 's influence in its region . Critics of these campaigns , such as author Peter Charlton , argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective . The 5th Division replaced the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain campaign with the goals of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul . In late November the 5th Division established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau . The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas . By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force 's aggressive patrolling . The 5th Division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign . After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong , which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain . The II Corps continued the Bougainville campaign after it replaced the US Army 's XIV Corps between October and December 1944 . The corps consisted of the 3rd Division , 11th Brigade and Fiji Infantry Regiment on Bougainville and the 23rd Brigade which garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by RAAF , Royal New Zealand Air Force and United States Marine Corps air units . While the XIV Corps had maintained a defensive posture , the Australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying the Japanese force on Bougainville . As the Japanese were split into several enclaves the II Corps fought separate offensives in the northern , central and southern portions of the island . The main focus was against the Japanese base at Buin in the south , and the offensives in the north and centre of the island were largely suspended from May 1945 . While Australian operations on Bougainville continued until the end of the war , large Japanese forces remained at Buin and in the north of the island . The 6th Division was assigned responsibility for completing the destruction of the Japanese Eighteenth Army , which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea . Supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships , the division was reinforced by Militia and armoured units and began arriving at Aitape in October 1944 . In late 1944 the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards Wewak . The 17th Brigade advanced inland through the Torricelli Mountains while the remainder of the division moved along the coast . Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease , it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties . The 6th Division 's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather . The Australians secured the coastal area by early May , and Wewak was captured on 10 May after a small force was landed east of the town . By the end of the war the Eighteenth Army had been forced into what it had designated its \" last stand \" area . The Aitape \u2013 Wewak campaign cost 442 Australian lives while about 9,000 Japanese died and another 269 were taken prisoner . = = = Borneo campaign = = = The Borneo campaign of 1945 was the last major Allied campaign in the South West Pacific . In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July , the Australian I Corps , under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead , attacked Japanese forces occupying the island . Allied naval and air forces , centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and the US Thirteenth Air Force , also played important roles in the campaign . The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo 's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945 . The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur 's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945 , however , and its decision not to release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead . The campaign opened on 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group landed on the small island of Tarakan off the east coast of Borneo to secure the island 's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan . While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip , intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June . As a result , the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile . The next phase began on 10 June when the 9th Division conducted simultaneous assaults in north-west Labuan and on the coast of Brunei . While Brunei was quickly secured , the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week . After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24th Brigade was landed in North Borneo and the 20th Brigade advanced along the western coast of Borneo south from Brunei . Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance and most of north-west Borneo was liberated by the end of the war . During the campaign the 9th Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces such as Z Special Unit . The third and final stage of the campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of Borneo . This operation had been opposed by Blamey , who believed that it was unnecessary , but went ahead on the orders of MacArthur . After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July . Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but mopping up continued until the end of the war as isolated pockets of Japanese resistance remained . The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World War II . Although the Borneo campaign was criticised in Australia at the time , and in subsequent years , as pointless or a waste of soldiers ' lives , it did achieve a number of objectives , such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the NEI , capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war , who were being held in deteriorating conditions . = = = Post-war years = = = Prior to the end of the war on 15 August 1945 , the Australian military was preparing to contribute forces to the invasion of Japan . Australia 's participation in this operation would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces . It was planned to form a new 10th Division from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the Commonwealth Corps with British , Canadian and New Zealand units . The corps ' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps , and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of Honsh\u016b which was scheduled for March 1946 under Operation Coronet . Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August 1945 when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Japanese field commanders subsequently surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre and Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai , several locations in Borneo , Timor , Wewak , Rabaul , Bougainville and Nauru . Following the surrender the Australian Army faced a number of immediate operational and administrative issues , including the need to maintain security in the areas it occupied , the disarming and administration of surrendered Japanese forces in these areas , organising the return of approximately 177,000 soldiers ( including prisoners of war ) to Australia , the demobilisation and discharge of the bulk of the soldiers serving in the Army , and the raising of an occupation force for service in Japan . Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender . Under the terms of an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten , the head of South East Asia Command , Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo , the NEI east of Lombok ( including western New Guinea ) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific . The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945 . I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI , and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea . After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI . While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists , the Australians were careful to not become involved in the Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible . Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good , due in part to the decision by the Waterside Workers ' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI . The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946 . The Australian Army also contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . Volunteers for this force were recruited in late 1945 , with most being assigned to three new infantry battalions : the 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division , the 66th Battalion by men from the 6th Division and the 67th from 9th Division personnel . These and other units were grouped at Morotai as the 34th Brigade in October 1945 . The brigade 's departure for Japan was delayed until February 1946 by inter-Allied negotiations , but it eventually took over responsibility for enforcing the terms of the Japanese surrender in Hiroshima Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsular following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 . = = Leadership = = When the war began the Army was on the cusp of a generational change . At the time , the senior officers on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey , although Bennett had not held an appointment for seven years and Blamey for the last two . Then came the Chief of the General Staff , Major General John Lavarack ; the Adjutant General , Major General Sir Carl Jess ; Major General Owen Phillips , the Quartermaster General ; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman , the commander of the 3rd Division ; and Major General Iven Mackay , the commander 2nd Division . All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett , Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers . Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF , for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies . Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939 . Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) I Corps following its raising in March 1940 , while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division . The next most senior regular officers , all colonels , included men like Vernon Sturdee , Henry Wynter and John Northcott , all of whom had joined the Army before World War I. These officers held senior commands throughout the war , but seldom active ones . Below them were a distinct group of regular officers , graduates of the Royal Military College , Duntroon , which had opened in 1911 . Their number included Frank Berryman , William Bridgeford , Cyril Clowes , Horace Robertson , Sydney Rowell and George Alan Vasey . These officers had fought in World War I and reached the rank of major , but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years . Many left the Army to join the British or Indian armies , or the RAAF , or to return to civilian life . As a group , they had become embittered and resentful , and determined to prove that they could lead troops in battle . Many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with the British Army , which was important in the early years of the war when there was close cooperation between the two armies . Between the wars , the reservists enjoyed much better promotion prospects . While Alan Vasey , a major in the First AIF , was not promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel until 1937 , Kenneth Eather , a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I , was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935 . Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather than regular officers , who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy . Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige , Arthur Allen , Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring . Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders . The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer , Ivan Dougherty , David Whitehead , Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers ' contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability . At the start of the war , the majority of battalion commands went to older reservists , many of whom had commanded battalions or served in the First AIF . As the war went on , the average age of battalion commanders declined from 42.9 years old in 1940 to 35.6 in 1945 . The prevalence of regular officers in senior positions also rose , and in 1945 they held half of all senior appointments . They remained under-represented in unit commands , and , as in 1940 , there was still only one infantry battalion commanded by a regular officer . Following the outbreak of war with Japan , many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead Militia formations and fill important staff posts as the Army expanded . The following year , though , the Army reached its greatest extent after which it shrank in size . With a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than required , Blamey faced public and political criticism after he \" shelved \" several senior officers . The career prospects of junior officer were also affected , particularly in the infantry . Of the 52 officers promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in the last six months of 1944 only five were infantrymen , while two were engineers , and 45 were from the supporting arms . Meanwhile , the return of the AIF divisions to Australia from the Middle East in 1942 coincided with the arrival of large numbers of American troops , including the US 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions . From April 1942 MacArthur took over command of all US and Australian forces in the newly formed South West Pacific Area as Supreme Commander . Blamey had been appointed Commander-in-Chief AMF in March following his promotion to general , setting up Land Headquarters to subsume the role of the Military Board , which was suspended on 30 July . As Commander-in-Chief AMF he reported directly to MacArthur and was subsequently also given command of Allied Land Forces in the theatre . Yet although Australian forces made up the bulk of the Allied forces in SWPA until 1944 in practice for political reasons MacArthur ensured that Blamey only commanded Australian forces , while he also limited the number of Australian staff officers posted to General Headquarters , and they remained underrepresented for the remainder of the war . = = Equipment = = The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN , which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period . The result was that when war came in 1939 , the Army 's equipment was of World War I vintage , and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms . Most equipment was obsolescent and had to be replaced , and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons , equipment and motor vehicles . Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division , but since a division 's war establishment was around 3,000 , this was only enough for training . In February 1940 , the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes . Throughout the war , Australian infantry units were largely equipped with British-designed but Australian-made small arms and support weapons . The standard rifle was the SMLE No 1 Mk III * , manufactured since 1912 at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory . Small quantities of the Lee \u2013 Enfield No.4 Mk I / Mk I * rifle , made by the Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the US , were used in New Guinea although most of these rifles were provided to other branches of the Australian military and to the Volunteer Defence Corps in order to free up No.1 MkIII * rifles for frontline infantry units . American-made M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles and M1 carbines were also issued to some Australian infantry units attached to US Army formations in New Guinea . Direct fire support was provided by a mixture of machine guns , including the Vickers machine gun which was produced at Lithgow from 1929 , which were utilised by specialised machine-gun battalions and , later , also medium machine-gun platoons within infantry battalions . The Bren Gun replaced Lewis Gun as the standard automatic rifle in the early years of the war , and within infantry battalions was utilised at the section level . Their manufacture in Australia started in 1941 . To improve rates of fire , the American Thompson submachine gun was introduced but it was eventually replaced by the Australian-designed Owen Gun and the British-designed but Australian-modified and -made Austen submachine gun . Infantry platoons were also equipped with M36 grenades . The Boys anti-tank rifle was the standard infantry anti-tank weapon at the start of the war , but was replaced with the PIAT in 1943 . The heavier support weapons used by infantry battalions the war included the 2-inch mortar and Stokes 3-inch mortar . Infantry battalions were also equipped with Universal Carriers until being converted to the tropical warfare establishment in 1943 , when the organic carrier platoons were consolidated into companies assigned at divisional level . A man-pack flamethrower was also introduced in 1945 . Not until 17 January 1940 did Richard Casey obtain Cabinet 's approval to spend \u00a3 400,000 to construct a plant to manufacture 25 pounder field guns and 2 pounder anti-tank guns . Until the 25 pounder could become available in quantity , units in Australia and the Far East were equipped with the old 18 pounder . Some units in the Middle East operated the 18 / 25 pounder , an 18 pounder that had been re-bored to take 25 pounder ammunition , until they received British 25 pounders . The old 4.5 inch howitzer also saw service , with the 2 / 10th Field Regiment employing them in support of the 9th Division during the Siege of Tobruk . A collection of captured Italian guns , known as the \" Bush Artillery \" , were also employed . These were rendered obsolete when the 25 pounder became available in quantity . Eventually , 1,527 were manufactured in Australia . A special light weight version known as the Short 25 pounder was developed for jungle warfare . The requirement for a portable field piece in mountainous jungle led to the use of the 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer in the New Guinea campaign . The American 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 was also employed . Experience in the Western Desert campaign soon showed that the 2 pounder could not deal with German tanks , and it was superseded by the 6 pounder , which began coming off the assembly lines in Australia in July 1942 . In turn it was replaced in 1944 by the 17 pounder , which was manufactured at the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory . The anti-aircraft artillery were equipped with the Swedish-designed Bofors 40 mm gun , which was manufactured in Australia , and the British 3.7 inch Anti-Aircraft gun . Medium artillery included the American 155 mm Long Tom and the British 5.5 inch gun . The need for tanks to equip armoured units led the War Cabinet to approve the manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940 . Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943 , but none were used in action . Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas . A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941 , while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942 , and these proved to be the most suitable type for jungle warfare . A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign . The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee . Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions , but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas , they did not see action . An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944 . The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors . The Australian Army developed its own landing craft . Development of an Australian version of the Landing Craft Assault , the ALCV ( Australian Landing Craft , Vehicle ) , was carried out by Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company . Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River . The initial version , known as the ALCV I was found to be too small , so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed . An Australian version of the Landing Craft Mechanized , the ALCM , was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong . Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing craft , so the ALCV III , an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity , was produced . The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs , a type of similar capacity to an American Landing Craft Tank , with five Ford V8 engines . Only four were delivered before the end of the war , but they arrived in time to see service in New Guinea . By 1945 , due to a shrinking number of operational units and stepped up production , equipment shortages were a thing of the past . Indeed , the Army had more equipment that it actually needed . For example , a total of 368 25 pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand . Additionally , a total of 530 2 pounder and 6 pounder anti-tank guns were required , but the Army had 1,941 , while 68 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training , but there were 640 pieces available . Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren , of which 9,438 were required , but there were 21,139 in the system . The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required , due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare . = = Training and doctrine = = The Australian Army 's pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment . This doctrine and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries . Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa . By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment . However , there were also critical shortages of instructors . The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel , but there were few officers and men with the required skills in the small pre-war Army and many of them were already serving in the AIF 's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments . An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal , Victoria , in 1941 , and in March 1943 , the Armoured Corps Training Centre was moved there . Another problem for the Militia was a lack of continuity in the training . When the war began , men were called up for only one month 's additional training . This was then increased to three months ' additional training . In 1940 \u2013 41 , officers and non-commissioned officers were intensively trained for 18 to 24 days , after which there was a camp for 70 days . Meanwhile , soldiers who had been through the 90-day training regimen in 1939 \u2013 40 were given 12 days ' additional training , while those who had not completed this training undertook 70 days . This allowed for individual training , but prevented proper unit training . In July 1941 , fully trained soldiers who had completed 90 days ' training became liable for three months ' additional training per year while new recruits were liable for six months . At the same time , the War Cabinet provided for more intensive training for the full-time cadre of Militia units , which were not to exceed 25 percent of the unit 's strength . Training for the Militia and the VDC was also hampered in the early war years by a lack of small arms , particularly after the Dunkirk evacuation when Australia dispatched its reserve stock of rifles to Britain , in an effort to help replace equipment lost by the British Army , amidst concerns of an invasion of the United Kingdom after the Fall of France . Although the Army 's focus was on conventional warfare , in late 1940 Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood , a British officer , arrived in Australia with a small specialist staff to conduct training in unconventional warfare . A school , known as No. 7 Infantry Training Centre , was opened at Wilsons Promontory , Victoria , which was described as \" an isolated area of high , rugged and heavily timbered mountains , precipitous valleys , swiftly running streams , and swamps . \" The 1st , 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies and a nucleus of the 4th were raised by October 1941 when training was discontinued . After the outbreak of the war with Japan , the school was reopened as the Guerrilla Warfare School , the training of the fourth company was completed . These independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons , of which twelve were eventually raised , including the 1st , which had been destroyed early in the war ; as the war progressed they were used more in the flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare . The Australian Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1942 . Some lessons were passed on by officers who escaped from Malaya and Singapore , however , and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in May that year . AIF units that returned from North Africa undertook some training in jungle tactics before going into action , but the Militia units which initially faced the Japanese in New Guinea suffered from inadequate training , and this led to them suffering heavy casualties . In order to be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly , to acclimatise them during the process , and to allow more realistic training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain , Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942 . Eventually , accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops . As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944 , they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment . The men then went on leave , after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South-West Pacific . The Army 's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during the year . A jungle warfare school was opened at Canungra , Queensland , in November 1942 , and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit . Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre , an Independent Company training centre , and a tactical school . With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed . Over time , training programs included greater cooperation between the Army 's combat arms and with the other services . A Combined Training Centre , also known as HMAS Assault , opened on 1 September 1942 at Nelson Bay , adjacent to Port Stephens , New South Wales , as a central establishment for the training staffs , beach parties and small boat crews . In July 1942 , a Combined Training School was established at Bribie Island , Queensland , and nearby Toorbul Point for Army units . During 1943 and 1944 , combined training with the RAAF and RAN was also carried out at Trinity Beach , near Cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in the South West Pacific as the Allies advanced . The Australian Army began training paratroops in December 1942 as an offshoot of the training of Independent Companies . The 1st Parachute Battalion was subsequently formed in March 1943 . It reached full strength by January 1944 , but , although it was warned for action a number of times , including the possible rescue of prisoners of war held at Sandakan in 1945 , it did not see any fighting . After the war it participated in the reoccupation of Singapore . By 1945 the Army possessed a comprehensive schools system , with 40 schools of various kinds . Between 1942 and 1945 96,000 training courses were conducted . Soldiers who were selected to become officers were trained at various Officer Cadet Training Units around the country , and by the end of the war these units had produced 7,887 officers . Meanwhile , regular officers of the PMF continued to be trained at the Royal Military College , Duntroon with a number of shortened courses of between six months and a years ' duration being run . Unlike the First AIF , newly commissioned lieutenants were not sent back to their original unit , but were posted to the first vacancy . Other schools included the School of Artillery , the Guerrilla Warfare School , the Cooking and Catering School , the School of Military Law and the School of Movement and Transport . Recruit training was now thorough and exacting , and for infantrymen culminated in a jungle training course at Canungra , where the Jungle Warfare School turned out 4,000 reinforcements a month . In 1945 , the 29th Brigade received 1,000 young reinforcements shortly before embarking for Torokina , but their commander later remarked that their training at Canungra had been so thorough that they \" reacted with almost miraculous quickness to conditions of battle . \" = = Prisoners of war = = Nearly 29,000 Australians were taken prisoner by the Axis during the war , the bulk of them members of the Australian Army . During the fighting in the Middle East and Greece , 7,116 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner by German and Italian forces . Of these men , 3,109 were captured at Crete and 2,065 on the mainland of Greece . Most of the other POWs were members of the 9th Division captured during the retreat from Cyrenaica in early 1941 , the siege of Tobruk or the fighting near El Alamein in mid-1942 . Like other western Allied POWs , the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany and were generally treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions . As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies . These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths . As the war drew to a close , a unit designated the AIF Reception Group ( United Kingdom ) was established near Eastbourne in England to provide accommodation and support for the POWs once they were released . By August 1945 all the former Australian POWs in Europe had embarked on ships bound for Australia . While Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World War I , it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment . More than 21,000 members of the AIF were captured by the Japanese during the first months of 1942 . Most of these men were members of the 8th Division captured at Singapore , the NEI and Rabaul , but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there . Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly , resulting in a high death rate . Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships . While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease , hundreds were murdered by their guards . The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences , as 13,000 Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese ; nearly 2,650 Australians died there . Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions . The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates ; 77 percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500 Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived ; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945 . Overall , only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity . The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease . The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war . Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country 's zone of responsibility after the war , and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered war crimes trials . = = Demobilisation = = The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities , although it had partially commenced as early as 1943 . At the end of the war the strength of the Australian Army was 398,594 men , approximately half of which were serving overseas in the South West Pacific Area . The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 August 1945 , the day after Japan surrendered . Undertaken in four phases , it was finally completed on 15 February 1947 by which time a total of 349,964 soldiers had been discharged . Although the process largely proceeded smoothly , many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in the South West Pacific after the war ended . The speed of demobilisation was hampered by the requirement to continue to maintain security in the areas still occupied , the lack of sufficient shipping , the administrative workload entailed , and limited facilities for use for the demobilisation process . Although the Second AIF was not disbanded until 30 June 1947 a temporary organisation known as the Interim Army was established at the end of the war and included all members of the Army on full-time duty . Meanwhile , in a departure from previous defence policy the Australian government decided that a small peace-time regular force was to be raised to provide a trained , full-time force capable of being deployed either in Australia or overseas in a national emergency and the Australian Regular Army was subsequently established on 30 September 1947 .

It took place on January 7 , 2007 , at Kemper Arena in Kansas City , Missouri and featured wrestlers and other talent from WWE 's Raw brand . There were seven professional wrestling matches scheduled on the event 's card . Four championships exclusive to the Raw brand were contested for ; none was lost as all four championships were retained . The main event was a standard wrestling match , in which WWE Champion John Cena defeated challenger Umaga to retain his championship . Two predominant bouts were featured on the undercard . The first was a Tag team match , in which World Tag Team Champions Rated-RKO ( Edge and Randy Orton ) fought D-Generation X ( Triple H and Shawn Michaels ) to a no-contest . Due to WWE rules , a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission , as a result , Rated-RKO retained their titles . Another main match was a steel cage match , a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around , in , or against the edges of the wrestling ring . WWE Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy defeated Johnny Nitro to retain his championship . The event received 220,000 pay-per-view buys , which was less than the 294,000 buys the previous year 's event received . The event was rated a six out of ten . When the event was released on DVD , it reached a peak position of fourth on Billboard 's DVD sales chart for recreational sports . It remained on the chart for six consecutive weeks . = = Background = = Seven professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card , which were planned with predetermined outcomes by WWE 's script writers . The buildup to these matches and scenarios that took place before , during and after the event were also planned by WWE 's script writers . The event featured wrestlers and other talent from WWE 's Raw brand , a storyline expansion in which WWE assigned its employees . Wrestlers portrayed either a villain or fan favorite gimmick , an on-screen character , for the entertainment of the audience . The main rivalry heading into New Year 's Revolution was between John Cena and Umaga over the WWE Championship . The rivalry all began on the November 6 episode of Raw , one of WWE 's main television programs , when Cena interfered in Umaga 's match while accepting a challenge to a match by Kevin Federline . One week later , Jonathan Coachman , an on-screen authority figure of Raw , a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer , announced that a match between Cena and Umaga would take place , which ended in a no-contest due to interference . Three weeks later on the November 27 edition of Raw , Umaga ( through Armando Alejandro Estrada ) issued a challenge to Cena for the WWE Championship , which Cena accepted . The following week , Cena was assaulted by Umaga after his match , and both were confronted by security . Afterwards , neither of them could touch each other outside of a match until New Year 's Revolution . On the December 18 edition of Raw , Cena , along with D-Generation X , ( Triple H and Shawn Michaels ) faced off against Umaga and Rated-RKO ( Edge and Randy Orton ) . The match ended in a no-contest after Cena and Umaga started brawling to the backstage area . Two weeks later on the January 1 edition of Raw , Cena faced off against Federline in a No Disqualification match , a match where there is no rules and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission . During the match , Umaga came to the ring and hit Cena with the WWE championship belt , which allowed Federline to pin Cena for the win . This led to a 4-on-1 handicap match later that night between Johnny Nitro , Johnathan Coachman , Umaga , and Estrada and Cena , where Cena attacked Umaga with a folding chair , causing the disqualification . Another rivalry leading up to the event was between Johnny Nitro and Jeff Hardy . In September 2006 , Hardy challenged Nitro numerous times for the WWE Intercontinental Championship , but failed to win it due to repeated interference by Melina ( Melina Perez ) ( Nitro 's then-girlfriend ) . Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win the title on the October 2 edition of Raw . On the November 6 edition of Raw , Eric Bischoff , the Raw authority figure for the night , scheduled a match between Hardy and Nitro for the title . In the match , Melina interfered and caused Nitro to get disqualified . Due to WWE rules , a title can only change hands via pinfall or submission , as a result , Hardy retained his title . Bischoff then scheduled a No Disqualification match , which Nitro won after interference from Melina . The following week , Hardy and Nitro were scheduled in a Ladder match , a match where the contestant that climbs a ladder and retrieves an item ( usually a title belt ) hung above the ring is the winner . Hardy won the match and the title . On the November 27 episode of Raw , Nitro and his former tag team partner Joey Mercury , as MNM , accepted The Hardys open challenge for WWE 's December pay-per-view , December to Dismember , which the Hardys came out victorious . The Hardys won the match . At Armageddon another one of WWE 's December pay-per-views , MNM and The Hardys competed in a Four team Ladder match also involving Dave Taylor and William Regal and WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick . London and Kendrick won the match and retained their titles . During the match , Mercury legitimately broke his nose when he was struck in the face with a ladder , when Jeff jumped off the top rope . On the December 18 edition of Raw , Nitro challenged Hardy to a Steel Cage match , a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around , in , or against the edges of the wrestling ring , for the Intercontinental Championship , which Hardy accepted . The match then was scheduled for New Year 's Revolution . The rivalry between Rated-RKO ( Edge and Randy Orton ) and D-Generation X ( DX ; Triple H and Shawn Michaels ) began on the October 9 edition of Raw . Edge and Orton both had problems with DX in the past and formed an alliance against them , and challenged DX to a match at Cyber Sunday , WWE 's only pay-per-view where people can go online and votes for different aspects of a match . Rated-RKO defeated DX , after Eric Bischoff , the referee of the match , let Orton use a folding chair , which led Rated-RKO to victory . For consecutive weeks , Triple H and Orton competed in singles matches . On the December 11 edition of Raw , Flair assisted DX in an ambush by Rated-RKO and Kenny , and Coachman came out to announce a Six-man tag team match , where DX and Flair again emerged victorious . DX would challenge Rated-RKO for the World Tag Team Championships at New Year 's Revolution . The feud between Ric Flair and Kenny Dykstra ( originally just Kenny ) stemmed from Flair 's feud with the Spirit Squad , which Dykstra was a part of . On the October 23 edition of Raw , Dykstra was angered by his teammates ' recent losing streak against Flair , and he proved himself by defeating Flair that night in a singles match . Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship , Flair and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO . The legitimate reason behind their title loss was that Piper was diagnosed with cancer and had to immediately leave the show . Flair , however , continued to feud with the Spirit Squad , defeating them all at Survivor Series with his team of WWE legends . On the November 27 edition of Raw , Flair teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match . Flair and DX won , and DX packed them all in a crate ( excluding Dykstra ) and kayfabe sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling . It was announced that Flair would face Dykstra at New Year 's Revolution . = = Event = = Before the event went live on pay-per-view , Vladimir Kozlov defeated Eugene in a dark match . = = = Preliminary matches = = = The first match that aired was for the WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match , a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around , in , or against the edges of the wrestling ring . Jeff Hardy was defending the title against Johnny Nitro . The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs off the top of the cage . Near the end of the match , Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb , but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope . Nitro then made it over the cage , but just as Nitro was about to jump , Hardy dropkicked the door open , and Nitro fell onto the top of the door , paining him between his legs . As Nitro was on top of the door , Hardy kicked the cage door , and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship . The next match was for a future World Tag Team Championship in a Tag Team Turmoil match , a match where two tag teams start out and when a team was defeated , another came out until the match ended . The match began with the teams of The World 's Greatest Tag Team ( Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas ) and The Highlanders ( Robbie and Rory McAllister ) .

The third team , Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defeated The World 's Greatest Tag Team after Cade performed a diving elbow drop on Haas and scored the pinfall . The final team , Cryme Tyme ( Shad Gaspard and JTG ) , won the match after performing a G9 and pinning Cade to become the top contenders to the World Tag Team Championship , though they never received their championship match . After the match , Jonathan Coachman and Vince McMahon were backstage discussing the personal feud between Donald Trump and Rosie O 'Donnell . McMahon announced a match between the two the next night on Raw . The third contest was between Kenny Dykstra and Ric Flair . The end of the match saw Dykstra executing an illegal low blow , when the referee was not paying attention and rolled Flair up with a small package to secure the pinfall . The next match was between Mickie James and Victoria . Melina ( who accompanied Victoria down to the ring ) , interfered in the match , but failed to following interference by Candice Michelle and Maria . James then did a Mickie DDT and pinned Victoria to retain her title . Next was the World Tag Team Championship match between the defending champions Rated-RKO and D-Generation X ( DX ) . During the match , Triple H did a spinebuster on Orton and injured his right leg . The match ended when Michaels hit the referee and then assaulted Rated-RKO with a chair . DX used steel chairs to beat down Rated-RKO . After the match , DX brutalized Rated-RKO and left them a bloody mess on the announcers ' tables . Triple H gave Edge a Pedigree on the announce table , and Shawn Michaels did the diving elbow drop on Randy Orton through the Spanish announce table . The sixth contest was between Carlito and Chris Masters . The match came to an end when Carlito reversed the Masterlock attempt by Masters , however Masters fell on Carlito and performed a pin to successfully score the pinfall . = = = Main event match = = = Next was the main event , which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against Umaga . During the match , Cena attempted and failed to perform the FU various times . Cena would keep attacking Umaga by throwing Umaga 's head into the steel ring post , which was followed up by a Five Knuckle Shuffle . When Cena failed to execute a FU , Umaga would take control . Umaga charged at Cena , who was positioned in a corner , but Cena would put his feet up to superkick Umaga in the face . This move allowed Cena to quickly roll-up Umaga for the win . Cena had ended Umaga 's undefeated streak and retained his WWE Championship . = = Aftermath = = The feud between John Cena and Umaga continued on Raw the next night , where Umaga assaulted Cena after his match with The Great Khali and also interfered in Cena 's match with Jonathan Coachman two weeks later . Due to the Umaga assault , Cena injured his spleen , which was portrayed as real in their storyline . At Royal Rumble , a Last Man Standing match , a match where the only way to win is to beat up your opponent so much they can not get to their feet before the referee counts to ten was scheduled for the WWE Championship between Cena and Umaga . Cena won the match and retained his title , ending their rivalry . It was announced that Triple H was injured with a ruptured quadriceps tendon and he did not compete on WWE television for over seven months . Shawn Michaels however , continued his feud with Rated-RKO by teaming up with Cena and defeating them for their World Tag Team Championship on the post-Royal Rumble episode of Raw . The feud ended shortly afterwards as Rated-RKO disbanded after their own rivalry began . A Triple Threat match , a standard match involving three wrestlers was made between Edge , Orton , and Michaels . Michaels won the match to become the number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 23 . Michaels then feuded with Cena , which would end at Backlash , when Cena defeated Edge , Orton and Michaels in a Fatal Four Way match , a standard wrestling match involving four wrestlers to retain his WWE Championship . Jeff Hardy and Johnny Nitro continued to feud as members of The Hardys and MNM respectively , until their rematch at the Royal Rumble , where the Hardys were victorious .

It was the seventh annual No Mercy event , and featured eight professional wrestling matches on the event 's card . The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before , during , and after the event were planned by WWE 's script writers . The event starred wrestlers from the SmackDown ! brand : a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner . The main event was a Last Ride match , where the objective was to place an opponent in a hearse located on the entrance stage and drive them out of the arena . WWE Champion John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield ( JBL ) defeated The Undertaker in this match to retain his title . Two predominant bouts were featured on the undercard ; in respective singles matches , John Cena defeated Booker T to win the WWE United States Championship , and The Big Show defeated Kurt Angle .

This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $ 6.2 compared to the previous year . = = Background = = The event featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds , plots and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension , leading to a wrestling match . All wrestlers were from the SmackDown ! brand \u2013 a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program , the other being Raw . The main event featured WWE Champion John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield ( JBL ) defending the title against The Undertaker in a match where the objective is to place an opponent in a hearse located on the entrance stage and drive them out of the arena , dubbed a Last Ride match . The buildup to the match began after SummerSlam , Smackdown 's previous pay-per-view event , where JBL defeated the Undertaker in a standard wrestling match , also called a singles match , via disqualification to retain his championship . During that week on an episode of SmackDown ! , JBL wore a neck brace , to signify that he was recuperating from a chokeslam that the Undertaker gave him on top of his limo . On the August 26 , 2004 episode of SmackDown ! , Orlando Jordan , one of JBL 's associates , defended the WWE Championship for JBL against the Undertaker . Undertaker won the match via disqualification following interference from JBL ; as a result , JBL retained the title . Two weeks later , General Manager Theodore Long , a fictitious match maker and rules enforcer , announced that Undertaker would get another opportunity for JBL 's title at No Mercy in a Last Ride match . One of the featured matches was contested for the WWE United States Championship , in which Booker T defended the title against John Cena . At SummerSlam , Cena defeated Booker in the first series of \" best of five \" match . On the August 26 episode of SmackDown ! , the second match was won by Booker , to even the series one-to-one . The following night at a SmackDown ! live event , Booker defeated Cena to win the third match . On the September 16 episode of SmackDown ! , Cena defeated Booker in the fourth match , making the series even at two wins apiece . The following week it was announced that the final series title match would be scheduled at No Mercy . The other featured preliminary match was Kurt Angle versus The Big Show in a singles match . The buildup to the match began on September 9 , 2004 during an episode of SmackDown ! , where a Lumberjack match ( a standard match where non-participating wrestlers prevent contestants from fleeing the ring ) was scheduled between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero . The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown ! by interfering in the match , chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process . The following week , Big Show was given two contracts to choose from ; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle . Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero 's name on it . After signing it , Angle and his associate Luther Reigns , threw Guerrero out of the ring and offered Big Show a handshake . Big Show , however , tore up Guerrero 's contract and signed the one with Angle 's name on it to face him at No Mercy . = = Event = = Before the event went live on pay-per-view , Mark Jindrak defeated Scotty 2 Hotty in a match taped for Heat , one of WWE 's secondary television programs . = = = Preliminary matches = = = The first televised match was a standard wrestling match between Eddie Guerrero and Luther Reigns accompanied with Mark Jindrak . In the early stages both competitors took the advantage over one another . Reigns controlled most of the match , as Guerrero tried to avoid Luther 's assaults .

The match saw Guerrero take the advantage , as he was able to counter a swinging neckbreaker . The match concluded when Guerrero won the match by striking Reigns with a baton taken from a security guard .

Back and forth action saw both competitors take the advantage over one another . The match ended when Stamboli tried to prevent interference from D-Von , allowing Bubba to trip up Nunzio and crotched him on the ring post and giving Spike the win and retention of his title . The next match that followed was between Billy Kidman and Paul London . The start of the match saw London toss Kidman out of the ring and perform a running springboard moonsault , a move in which a wrestler springboards and executes a backflip to land on the opponent , from the top ropes to the outside onto Kidman . Kidman , however , took control once back in the ring , as he performed various stiff kicks on London 's midsection and focusing on his lower back . London attempted to perform a powerbomb , but was not successful in doing so as Kidman reversed it into a sitout facebuster for a near-fall . The match concluded with Kidman as he executed a Shooting star press on London to get the pinfall victory over London . The fourth match was for the WWE Tag Team Championship , in which champions Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e and Kenzo Suzuki defended the title against Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio .

Mysterio was tagged in the match and performed a flying headbutt on Kenzo , followed by a tornado DDT onto Kenzo . Mysterio followed this by knocking Dupr\u00e9e off the apron and launching himself back into the ring , onto Kenzo in a seated senton , a move performed by jumping forward off a raised platform or springboarding on to the shoulders of a standing opponent forcing them to the ground . Mysterio tried to perform the 619 on Kenzo , however , Dupr\u00e9e stopped Mysterio from doing so . Mysterio then performed the 619 on Kenzo . As he prepared to perform the West Coast Pop , Dupr\u00e9e pulled Mysterio off the ropes . This led to Kenzo pinning Mysterio , as he held onto the ropes for leverage to pick up the win and retain the tag team title . = = = Main event matches = = = The first main match was between Kurt Angle and The Big Show . A stipulation in the match was placed that anyone who tried to interfere would get fired . For the duration of the match , The Big Show , who stood at 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) and weighed 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) , used his body size to his advantage as he squashed , or easily and quickly performed moves on , Angle . Angle , who had enough , began to walk away from the match . Angle ran back to the ring and counted along with the referee for the 10 count . General Manager Theodore Long ordered Angle to return to the match with a no count out stipulation or else Angle would never wrestle on SmackDown ! again . Angle returned to the ring , in which Big Show dominated once more , even standing on Angle . A frustrated Angle brought a steel chair , but backfired when Big Show punched the chair onto Angle 's face . As Big Show prepared to perform a chokeslam , Angle countered into an ankle lock hold . Big Show managed to get a hold of the ropes to force Angle to break the hold and he was scripted to knock the referee down . Angle began targeting Big Show 's knee and even hitting his knee with the steel chair , to take advantage of the referee 's state . The match ended with Big Show chokeslamming Angle from the top of the ring . During this time , the referee regained consciousness and gave Big Show the pinfall victory . The second main match was a singles match , in which United States Champion Booker T defended the title against John Cena in the final \" best of five \" match . In the early stages of the match , Cena and Booker fought at ringside . During this tussle Booker pounded Cena 's head into the ring steps before being reversed into them himself . The match then returned to the ring , which saw Booker and Cena getting the upper hand over one another . Cena took control as he performed several of his signature moves ; he ran up from behind Booker , grabbed his head with one hand and leaped forward to drive Booker 's face into the mat . He then followed with hitting a fist drop with theatrics , which Cena calls the Five Knuckle Shuffle . Cena tried to follow up with lifting Booker onto his shoulder , but Booker countered it into a Book End . Booker went for the pin on Cena , but he kicked out . Cena was able to dodge a kick to the back of the head that would force him to hit his face first into the mat , with lifting Booker over his shoulders and throwing him down to execute the FU . He pinned Booker to be declared the new United States Champion . Another match on the undercard was a mixed tag team match between the team of the Dudley Boyz ( D-Von and Bubba Ray ) and Dawn Marie versus Charlie Haas , Rico Constantino , and Miss Jackie . The start of the match saw Haas get back body dropped by the Dudley 's . Dawn was tagged in to the match , as was Jackie who tagged herself in , if a man tags her female partner , both men leave the ring and both women enter the match . The two women began to beat one another . Bubba Ray tagged himself in and demanded Jackie give him a kiss , and closed his eyes . Rico came in and kissed Bubba Ray , prompting Bubba Ray to run away and gag audibly . Rico wrestled against D-Von , and was in control until Bubba Ray and D-Von double teamed him . Bubba Ray called for the flying head butt to the crotch , but D-Von was hesitant in performing the move on Rico . This caused Dawn and Jackie to continue their fight , as both entered the ring . The match ended when Haas performed a flying axe handle setting up the legal tag to Rico to perform a moonsault and get the win . The main event was the Last Ride match for the WWE Championship , in which John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield ( JBL ) defended the title against The Undertaker . During the beginning of the match , the Undertaker began hitting JBL in the corner , before twisting his arm around and dropping JBL 's arm on the top rope . Following this , the Undertaker chokeslammed JBL in the ring , and performed a leg drop off the ring apron . Outside the ring , the Undertaker threw JBL towards the steel ring steps . The Undertaker continued to uphold the upper hand over JBL , as he began to remove the television set from the Spanish announce table , but JBL managed to hit Undertaker upside the head with the steel ring steps . JBL tried to put the Undertaker in the hearse , but the Undertaker fought back . A frustrated JBL took the Undertaker back to the ring and hit a shoulder block from the top rope . The Undertaker managed to get the upper hand once more , as he applied a triangle choke hold on JBL , leading JBL to tap out , but submissions do not count prior in this match . The Undertaker backdropped out of a piledriver attempt on the steel ring steps and grabbed JBL , turned him upside-down and dropped into a kneeling position , driving JBL 's head into the steel steps , making JBL bleed from the head . Minutes later , the Undertaker chokeslammed JBL off the announce table through the Spanish table . The Undertaker carried JBL to the hearse , and Jon Heidenreich came out of the hearse . Heidenreich began to attack the Undertaker , covered his mouth with a soaked rag filled with chloroform . Heidenreich placed the Undertaker into the hearse and drove off . Inside the hearse , a camera was inside the hearse to show the Undertaker wake up and jump out and attack Heidenreich . JBL recovered , and swung his arm forward while running towards the Undertaker , a move JBL calls Clothesline from Hell , and helped Heidenreich place the Undertaker back into the hearse to be driven away . Backstage , Paul Heyman drove the hearse to the parking lot , where Heidenreich drove his car into it at high speed , causing an inexplicable explosion . As a result , JBL won the match and retained his title . = = Aftermath = = Following No Mercy , the storyline between JBL and The Undertaker ended . JBL was then placed in a new angle against Booker T. On an episode of SmackDown ! , a six man tag team match involving Booker T , Rob Van Dam , and Rey Mysterio taking on JBL , Kenzo Suzuki , and Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e was scheduled . At the time , Booker T being a villain , congratulated JBL with the success that he has accomplished within the company in a segment backstage . The tag team match got underway , and JBL was led to believe that Booker was going to betray his tag partners , as Booker warned both Van Dam and Mysterio not to interfere with him during the match . The match concluded with Booker pinning JBL for the win , thus turning Booker into a crowd favorite . The following week on SmackDown ! , Booker defeated Orlando Jordan , JBL 's associate , to earn the right to face JBL for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series . At Survivor Series , JBL defeated Booker to retain the WWE title . On the October 21 episode of SmackDown ! , Paul Heyman requested that Theodore Long schedule a match between Heidenreich and the Undertaker at Survivor Series . Long agreed to the match , but informed Heyman that in order for the match to take place , he had to get the Undertaker to sign the contract personally . The following week , Heyman met the Undertaker at an undisclosed location where he pleaded his case about Heidenreich wanting to face the Undertaker in a match .

The twins failed to win the Divas Championship again at WrestleMania XXX in the Divas Invitational match , which was won by AJ Lee . = = = = Feud with Stephanie McMahon and brief split ( 2014 ) = = = = In April 2014 , Brie became involved in her real-life husband Daniel Bryan 's ongoing storyline with Stephanie McMahon and Kane , where as part of the storyline , McMahon threatened to fire Brie if an injured Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Payback , which forced Brie to \" quit \" WWE before slapping McMahon in the face . After Brie quit , McMahon put Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment . After a month absence , Brie returned to WWE television , appearing in the crowd on July 21 ; following a confrontation , McMahon slapped Brie and was subsequently arrested . In order to have Brie drop the \" charges \" , Brie was rehired and received a match against McMahon at SummerSlam . At the pay \u2013 per \u2013 view , Nikki turned villainous by attacking Brie , which allowed McMahon to win the match . The next several weeks saw the twins fight in several backstage and in-ring segments , including a cameo appearance from Jerry Springer on Raw on September 8 . As part of the storyline , McMahon declared Nikki the face of the WWE Divas division and granted her a match at Night of Champions for the WWE Divas Championship , which she failed to win . Nikki then obtained permission to begin forcing Brie to compete in handicap matches , similar to her punishment at the hands of McMahon , although Brie was able to win them . This led to a match between the twins at Hell in a Cell , where the loser was forced to become the winner 's personal assistant for 30 days , in which Nikki defeated Brie . Five days later on SmackDown , Nikki won a Halloween costume battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship . = = = = Divas Champion and Team Bella ( 2014 \u2013 2015 ) = = = = Nikki received her title match against AJ Lee on November 23 at Survivor Series , which she won , with Brie 's help , to become a two \u2013 time Divas Champion . The duo had reconciled at this point , with Brie also turning heel in the process . Nikki then went on to retain her championship in three separate occasions \u2014 against Lee in a rematch on December 14 , at TLC : Tables , Ladders and Chairs , against Naomi two days later on SmackDown and against Paige at Fastlane on February 22 , 2015 . Paige and AJ then formed an alliance against Bellas which led to a tag team match at WrestleMania 31 , where AJ and Paige were victorious . On April 26 , after Nikki , with the help of Brie , once again retained her title against Naomi at Extreme Rules a feud started , with Naomi aligning with the returning Tamina ( Naomi 's real life husband Jimmy Uso 's real life cousin ) to even the odds against Bellas , who began showing more heroic characteristics , This change in character was criticized as \" sudden \" , \" randomly \" and \" for no reason \" . This led to a tag team match between the two teams on May 17 , at Payback , which Naomi and Tamina won . Two weeks later , at Elimination Chamber , Nikki retained her title against Naomi and Paige in a triple \u2013 threat match , with Brie banned from ringside . In June , The Bella Twins became villains once again by employing Twin Magic , which helped Nikki retain the title against Paige on the June 1 episode of Raw and at Money in the Bank . During the feud with Paige , Alicia Fox allied with them to form Team Bella . At the The Beast in the East on July 4 , Nikki retained the title against Paige and Tamina . After weeks of Team Bella outnumbering Paige , Naomi , and Tamina , Stephanie McMahon called for a \" revolution \" in the WWE Divas division and introduced the debuting Charlotte and Becky Lynch as Paige 's allies . NXT Women 's Champion Sasha Banks debuted as an ally to Naomi and Tamina , which led to a brawl between the three teams . Nikki then lost to Charlotte in a tag team match on the August 3 episode of Raw , and to Sasha on the August 17 episode of Raw in a non \u2013 title match . The three teams faced off on August 23 at SummerSlam in a three team elimination match , in which Team Bella first eliminated Team B.A.D. , before Team PCB 's win . On the September 14 episode of Raw , Nikki defended her title against Charlotte , who pinned Brie after the twins had switched places to win the match , however , since the title can 't change hands by disqualification , Nikki retained the championship , and in the process , became the new longest reigning Divas Champion in history , surpassing AJ Lee 's previous record of 295 days . = = = = Nikki 's injury and Brie 's semi-retirement ( 2015 \u2013 2016 ) = = = = Nikki dropped the championship to Charlotte , on September 20 , at Night of Champions , ending her reign at 301 days , and failed to regain the title in a rematch on October 25 at Hell in a Cell . Shortly after , Nikki went on a hiatus from both television and in-ring competition due to a neck injury which would require surgery , but returned for one night on December 21 , to accept the Slammy Award for Diva of the Year . During this time , Brie continued to compete in singles competition , and in tag team matches with Fox . After defeating Charlotte in a non \u2013 title match on the February 1 episode of Raw , Brie was granted a match for the WWE Divas Championship at Fastlane on February 21 , where she failed to capture the title . During that time , Team Bella quietly disbanded and Brie transitioned into a fan favorite . In March 2016 , Brie was placed in a feud with Lana , who argued that Brie 's fans only supported her out of pity for having a \" bad husband \" , and went on to distract Brie during her matches and attack her after the matches . Brie then aligned herself with fellow Total Divas cast members Alicia Fox , Natalya , Paige and Eva Marie , while Lana aligned herself with Team B.A.D. ( Naomi and Tamina ) , Summer Rae and Emma ( which was officially called \" Team B.A.D. and Blonde \" ) , leading to a 10-woman tag team match on the WrestleMania 32 kick-off show , which Team Total Divas would win when Naomi submitted to Brie . After the match , Nikki returned and celebrated with her co-stars Three days later , on April 6 , Brie confirmed that she would be taking an extended break from in-ring competition , citing family reasons , while also stating that she will continue working for WWE as an ambassador . = = Other media = = Prior to working with WWE , the twins appeared on Meet My Folks .

He is the Executive Vice President of Talent , Live Events , & Creative of WWE , creator of WWE NXT , and the founder and senior producer of NXT . He is married into the McMahon family , which maintains majority ownership of WWE . In addition to his corporate role , Levesque makes regular appearances on WWE television as an authority figure and former wrestler . Levesque entered several bodybuilding contests after graduating high school in 1987 . He commenced his professional wrestling career in the International Wrestling Federation ( IWF ) in 1992 , under the ring name Terra Ryzing , and won his first championship , the IWF Heavyweight Championship . He joined World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) in 1994 , where he was soon repackaged as Jean-Paul L\u00e9vesque , a French Canadian aristocrat . In 1995 , Levesque moved to the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , now WWE ) , where he became Hunter Hearst Helmsley and , later , Triple H. In 1997 , Triple H co-founded the influential D-Generation X stable , which became a major element of the WWF 's \" Attitude Era \" . After winning his first WWF Championship and beginning a storyline marriage with Stephanie McMahon in 1999 , Triple H became a regular main event wrestler ( in 2003 , Levesque married McMahon in real life ) . Over the next two decades , he would win a total of 14 world championships and lead stables The McMahon-Helmsley Faction , Evolution , and The Authority , with whom he continues to perform . From 2010 onwards , Triple H began wrestling on a part-time basis as he took on a greater behind-the-scenes role within WWE . In the course of his career , Levesque has held a total of 25 championships , including nine WWF / E Championships and five World Heavyweight Championships . He is the seventh Triple Crown Champion and the second Grand Slam Champion in WWF / E history . Triple H was also the winner of the 1997 King of the Ring tournament , and the 2002 and 2016 Royal Rumbles . He has headlined WrestleMania , WWE 's flagship pay-per-view , seven times , thus tying Hulk Hogan 's record . Outside of professional wrestling , he has made numerous guest appearances in film and on television , including the lead role in the WWE Studios production The Chaperone . = = Early life = = Levesque was born in Nashua , New Hampshire . He watched wrestling for the first time when he was five , a match involving Chief Jay Strongbow . Levesque began to take up bodybuilding at the age of 14 , because he wanted to look like professional wrestlers . Levesque attended Nashua South High School , where he played baseball and basketball . Following his graduation from high school in 1987 , Levesque continued to enter several bodybuilding competitions , and was crowned Mr. Teenage New Hampshire in 1988 at the age of 19 . While working as a manager at Gold 's Gym in Nashua , New Hampshire , Levesque was introduced to world champion powerlifter , Ted Arcidi , who at the time was employed with the WWE . Eventually , after numerous attempts , Levesque persuaded Arcidi to introduce him to former pro wrestler and trainer , Killer Kowalski , who owned and ran a professional wrestling training school based in Malden , Massachusetts . In early 1992 , Levesque enrolled in Kowalski 's wrestling school , where he began to train as a professional wrestler . = = Professional wrestling career = = = = = Early career ( 1992 \u2013 1994 ) = = = Levesque was trained to wrestle by Killer Kowalski at his school in Malden , Massachusetts . His class mates included fellow future WWF wrestlers Chyna and Perry Saturn . Levesque made his professional debut on March 24 , 1992 in Kowalski 's promotion , the International Wrestling Federation ( IWF ) , performing as Terra Ryzing . In July 1992 , Levesque defeated Mad Dog Richard to win the IWF Heavyweight Championship . Levesque wrestled for various promotions on the East Coast independent circuit until 1994 . During this period , he was managed by John Rodeo . = = = World Championship Wrestling ( 1994 \u2013 1995 ) = = = In early 1994 , Levesque signed a one-year contract with World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) . In his first televised match , Levesque debuted as a villain named Terror Risin ' , defeating Keith Cole . His ring name was soon modified to Terra Ryzing , which he used until mid-1994 , when he was renamed Jean-Paul L\u00e9vesque . This gimmick referred to his surname 's French origins and he was asked to speak with a French accent , as he could not speak French . During this time , he began using his finishing maneuver , the Pedigree . Levesque had a brief feud with Alex Wright that ended at Starrcade 1994 with Wright pinning him . Between late 1994 and early 1995 , Levesque briefly teamed with Lord Steven Regal , whose upper class British persona was similar to Levesque 's character . The team was short-lived , however , as Levesque left for the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) in January 1995 after WCW turned down his request to be promoted as a singles competitor . = = = World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment / WWE = = = = = = = The Connecticut Blueblood ( 1995 \u2013 1997 ) = = = = In a modified version of his gimmick in WCW , Levesque started his WWF career as a \" Connecticut Blueblood \" . According to Levesque , JJ Dillion originally gave him the name of Reginald DuPont Helmsley , but Levesque asked for a name to play with the first letters ; management ultimately agreed to his suggestion of Hunter Hearst Helmsley . He appeared in taped vignettes , in which he talked about how to use proper etiquette , up until his wrestling debut on the April 30 , 1995 episode of Wrestling Challenge . He made his WWF pay-per-view debut at SummerSlam , where he defeated Bob Holly . In the fall of 1995 , Levesque began a feud with the hog farmer Henry O. Godwinn , culminating in an infamous Hog Pen match at In Your House 5 : Seasons Beatings , where Levesque was victorious . Although he was highly promoted in the first few months after his debut , Levesque 's career stalled during 1996 , starting off with a feud with Duke \" The Dumpster \" Droese following a loss during the Free for All at 1996 Royal Rumble . Up until that event , his angle included appearing on television each week with a different female valet ( which included Playboy Playmates Shae Marks and Tylyn John ) . Sable was his valet at WrestleMania XII , and after his loss to The Ultimate Warrior , as part of the storyline , he took his aggressions out on her . The debuting Marc Mero \u2013 her real-life husband \u2013 came to her rescue , starting a feud between the two wrestlers . On June 1 , 1996 , Helmsley appeared on an episode of Superstars in a match against Marty Garner . When Levesque attempted to perform the Pedigree , Garner mistook the maneuver for a double underhook suplex and tried to jump up with the move , causing him to land squarely on top of his head and suffer neck damage . Garner sued the WWF , eventually settling out of court and later discussed the incident in an appearance on The Montel Williams Show . Levesque was known backstage as one of the members of The Kliq , a stable of wrestlers including ; Shawn Michaels , Kevin Nash , Sean Waltman and Scott Hall , who were known for influencing Vince McMahon and the WWF creative team . It has been claimed that he was scheduled to win the 1996 King of the Ring tournament , but the victory was instead awarded to Stone Cold Steve Austin after the Madison Square Garden Incident , in which the Kliq broke character after a match to say goodbye to the departing Nash and Hall . Despite the punishment , Helmsley did have success following the MSG Incident . Mr. Perfect became his manager and he won the Intercontinental Championship for the first time on October 21 , 1996 , defeating Marc Mero . When Mr. Perfect left the WWF , his departure was explained to be a result of Helmsley turning his back on his manager as soon as he won the Intercontinental Championship . Levesque held the belt for nearly four months before dropping it to Rocky Maivia on the February 13 , 1997 special episode of Monday Night Raw , called Thursday Raw Thursday . For a very brief time , Helmsley was accompanied by Mr. Hughes , who was his storyline bodyguard . After losing the Intercontinental title , he feuded with Goldust , defeating him at WrestleMania 13 . During their feud , Chyna debuted as his new bodyguard . = = = = D-Generation X ( 1997 \u2013 1999 ) = = = = Helmsley was being highlighted again in 1997 , winning the 1997 King of the Ring tournament by defeating Mankind in the finals . Later that year , Shawn Michaels , Helmsley , Chyna and Rick Rude formed D-Generation X ( DX ) . This stable became known for pushing the envelope , as Michaels and Helmsley made risqu\u00e9 promos \u2013 using the catchphrase \" Suck It \" and a \" crotch chop \" hand motion , \u2013 and sarcastically derided Bret Hart and Canada . By that point , Helmsley had fully dropped the \" blueblood snob \" gimmick , appearing in T-shirts and leather jackets . During this period , his ring name was shortened to simply Triple H. Even after the DX versus Hart Foundation storyline ended , Helmsley continued to feud with the sole remaining Hart family member Owen Hart over the European Championship . This ended in a match between the two at WrestleMania XIV , with the stipulation that Chyna had to be handcuffed to then-Commissioner Sgt. Slaughter . Helmsley won after Chyna threw powder into Slaughter 's eyes , momentarily \" blinding \" him and allowing her to interfere in the match . After WrestleMania , Michaels was forced into temporary retirement due to a legitimate back injury sustained at the Royal Rumble , with Triple H taking over the leadership position in DX , claiming that his now-former associate had \" dropped the ball \" . He introduced the returning X-Pac the night after WrestleMania and joined forces with The New Age Outlaws . As 1998 went along , DX became more popular , turning the group from villains to fan favorites . During this time , Levesque adopted an entrance gimmick of asking the crowd \" Are you ready ? I said , are you ready ? \" , followed by a parody of rival promotion WCW 's ring announcer Michael Buffer 's famous catch-phrase , \" Let 's get ready to rumble \" , substituting the word \" rumble \" with the DX slogan , \" suck it \" . Also during this time , he began a feud with the leader of the Nation of Domination and rising WWF villain , The Rock . This storyline rivalry eventually led to a feud over the Intercontinental Championship , which Triple H won in a ladder match at SummerSlam . He did not hold the title long , however , as he was sidelined with a legitimate knee injury . When The Rock won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series , the rivalry between the two continued , as DX fought The Corporation stable , of which The Rock was the main star . Triple H received a shot at the WWF Championship on the January 25 , 1999 Raw Is War in an \" I Quit \" match against The Rock , but the match ended when Triple H was forced to quit or see his aide Chyna chokeslammed by Kane . This began a new angle for Triple H , as Chyna betrayed him by attacking him after the match and joining The Corporation . At WrestleMania XV , Triple H lost to Kane after Chyna interfered on his behalf , and she was thought to have rejoined DX . Later on in the night , he betrayed his long-time friend and fellow DX member X-Pac by helping Shane McMahon retain the European Championship and joined The Corporation. turning heel in the process . In April , he started to move away from his DX look , taping his fists for matches , sporting new and shorter wrestling trunks , and adopting a shorter hairstyle . Levesque 's gimmick changed as he fought to earn a WWF Championship opportunity . After numerous failed attempts at winning the championship , Triple H and Mankind challenged then WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to a triple threat match at SummerSlam , which featured Jesse \" The Body \" Ventura as the special guest referee . Mankind won the match by pinning Austin . The following night on Raw Is War , Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF Championship . Triple H dropped the WWF Championship to Mr. McMahon on the September 16 , 1999 episode of SmackDown ! before regaining it at Unforgiven in a Six-Pack Challenge that included Davey Boy Smith , Big Show , Kane , The Rock , and Mankind . He defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin at No Mercy before dropping the title to Big Show at Survivor Series . Triple H then continued his feud with Mr. McMahon by marrying his daughter , Stephanie McMahon . He then defeated McMahon at Armageddon . As a result of the feud , an angle with Triple H and Stephanie began which carried the WWF throughout the next seventeen months ; together they were known as The McMahon-Helmsley Faction . = = = = McMahon-Helmsley Era ( 2000 \u2013 2001 ) = = = = By January 2000 , Triple H had dubbed himself \" The Game \" , implying that he was on top of the wrestling world ( as in not merely the \" best in the game \" , but that he was in fact \" the game \" ) and was nicknamed \" The Cerebral Assassin \" by Jim Ross ( \" The Game \" nickname was originally intended for Owen Hart , with Triple H adopting the nickname in honor of Owen ) . On the January 3 episode of Raw Is War , Triple H defeated Big Show to win his third WWF championship . Triple H feuded with Mick Foley in early 2000 . They both fought at the Royal Rumble in a Street Fight Match for the WWF Championship , which Triple H won after performing two Pedigrees on Foley . The feud ended at No Way Out in a Hell in a Cell , where Triple H retained the title and forced Foley to retire . Triple H pinned The Rock at WrestleMania 2000 to retain the title , but lost it at Backlash to The Rock , thus ending his reign at 118 days . He regained it three weeks later , in an Iron Man match at Judgment Day , only to lose it back to The Rock at King of the Ring . Triple H then entered a storyline with Chris Jericho , who upset Triple H by defeated him for the WWF Championship on the April 17 episode of Raw Is War before the title was returned to Triple H because of a fast count made by referee Earl Hebner , and Jericho 's reign is not being recognized . Their feud culminated in a Last Man Standing match at Fully Loaded which was won by Triple H. Afterwards , Triple H entered a feud with Kurt Angle , initially over the WWF Championship , but then as a love triangle between himself , Angle , and Stephanie . Both Triple H and Angle wrestled for the WWF Championship against The Rock at SummerSlam , but The Rock retained the title after Angle received a legit concussion during a botched Pedigree on a commentary table by Triple H. The feud culminated at Unforgiven , where Triple H defeated Angle with a Pedigree after a low blow from McMahon . After a brief run as a face that saw him defeating Chris Benoit at No Mercy , Triple H reverted to his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi to run down Austin at Survivor Series , causing him to take a year off . While in the storyline Triple H said he had done it in order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career , in reality Austin 's previous neck injuries started bothering him again , forcing him to have surgery . In November 2000 , Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again , only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10 feet high . Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin , and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin . In 2001 , Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker , who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven . The night after WrestleMania , Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin ( who had just won the WWF Championship ) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock , forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip . Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown ! , and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy . Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time at Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a \" Winner Take All \" tag team match . As Triple H was still Intercontinental Champion , the win made him a double champion . During the May 21 , 2001 episode of Raw Is War , he suffered a legitimate and career-threatening injury . In the night 's main event , he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit . At one point , Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up , but just as he did , he suffered a tear in his left quadriceps muscle , causing it to come completely off the bone . Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg , Triple H was able to complete the match . He even allowed Jericho to put him in the Walls of Jericho , a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps . The tear required an operation , which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews . This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era , as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months , completely missing The Invasion storyline . = = = = Evolution ( 2002 \u2013 2005 ) = = = = Triple H returned to Raw as a face on January 7 , 2002 at Madison Square Garden . He won the Royal Rumble and received an Undisputed WWF Championship match at WrestleMania X8 , where Triple H defeated Chris Jericho for the Undisputed WWF Championship . After holding the title for a month , Triple H dropped it to Hulk Hogan at Backlash . Triple H then became exclusive to the SmackDown ! roster due to the WWF draft lottery and continued to feud with Jericho , culminating in a Hell in a Cell match at Judgment Day , which Triple H won . On the June 6 , 2002 episode of SmackDown ! , Triple H defeated Hogan in a # 1 contender match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at the King of the Ring against The Undertaker , but was unsuccessful at the event . In the interim , between the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania , the McMahon-Helmsley Faction was brought to an official on-screen conclusion . By the time he returned , Triple H 's on-screen marriage to Stephanie McMahon was faltering , so Stephanie faked a pregnancy in order to get him back on her side . When he learned that it was fake , he dumped her publicly on Raw when they were supposed to renew their wedding vows . Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward , but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she was pinned by Triple H. The divorce , and thus the storyline , was finalized at Vengeance . Meanwhile , Shawn Michaels had made his return to WWE and joined the New World Order ( nWo ) . Michaels and Kevin Nash planned to bring Triple H over to Raw in order to put him into the group . Mr. McMahon , however , disbanded the nWo following several backstage complications and brought in Eric Bischoff as the Raw general manager . One of Bischoff 's first intentions was to follow up on the nWo 's plan and bring Triple H over to the Raw roster . Triple H went to the Raw brand , reuniting with Michaels , but on July 22 he turned on Michaels by performing a Pedigree on him during what was supposed to be a DX reunion , turning heel once again . The following week , Triple H smashed Michaels ' face into a car window to prove that Michaels was weak . These events led to the beginning of a long storyline rivalry between the former partners and an eventual \" Unsanctioned Street Fight \" at SummerSlam , in which Michaels came out of retirement to win . Afterwards , however , Triple H attacked him with a sledgehammer and Michaels was carried out of the ring . Before September 2 , 2002 , WWE recognized only one world champion , the Undisputed WWE Champion , for both the Raw and SmackDown ! brands . After SummerSlam , then Undisputed WWE Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown ! , leaving Raw without a world champion . Raw general manager Eric Bischoff then awarded Triple H the Big Gold Belt ( which had been used for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and WCW World Heavyweight Championship ) making him the first World Heavyweight Champion . Triple H retained his title against Rob Van Dam at Unforgiven when Ric Flair hit Van Dam with a sledgehammer . In October 2002 , Triple H would begin a controversial feud with Kane , leading to a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane 's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H 's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake . In the weeks preceding the match , Triple H claimed that , several years earlier , Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick . He went on to claim that , after Vick was killed in a car crash , Kane ( the driver ) raped her corpse . Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question ; however , the footage that finally aired showed Triple H ( dressed as Kane ) simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a casket ; Kane 's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H ( rather , someone wearing a Triple H series of masks ) getting an enema . The angle was very unpopular with fans , and was de-emphasised before the title match . Triple H went on to defeat Kane at No Mercy , unifying the two titles . Triple H eventually lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Shawn Michaels in the first Elimination Chamber match at Survivor Series . He defeated Van Dam to earn a title shot at Armageddon with Michaels as the special guest referee . He regained the title from Michaels in a Three Stages of Hell match at Armageddon . In January 2003 , Triple H formed a stable known as Evolution with Ric Flair , Randy Orton , and Batista . Triple H and Flair challenged Rob Van Dam and Kane for the World Tag Team Championship , but they lost the match . The group was pushed on Raw from 2003 to 2004 and the height of their dominance occurred after Armageddon , where every member of Evolution left the pay-per-view holding a title . Triple H held the World Heavyweight Championship for most of 2003 , defending it at a match against Booker T at WrestleMania XIX in an angle with racist undertones . He lost the title after 280 days in September 2003 at Unforgiven to Bill Goldberg , in a match with the stipulation that had Goldberg lost , he would have to retire . After a failed attempt to win back the title from Goldberg in a rematch at the Survivor Series , he finally regained the championship against Goldberg in a triple threat match at Armageddon which also involved Kane . At the 2004 Royal Rumble , Triple H and Shawn Michaels fought in a Last Man Standing match to a double countout , so Triple H retained the title as a result . Triple H dropped the title to Chris Benoit at WrestleMania XX , and he was unable to reclaim the championship from Benoit in subsequent rematches , including a rematch from WrestleMania between Triple H , Benoit , and Shawn Michaels at Backlash . He then ended his feud with Michaels , defeating him in a Hell in a Cell match at Bad Blood , which became the longest Hell in a Cell match in history . After another failed attempt , losing to Benoit at Vengeance , he focused on Eugene , beating him at SummerSlam . Triple H then regained the title from former associate Randy Orton at Unforgiven . Following a triple threat World Heavyweight title defense against Benoit and Edge on the November 29 , 2004 episode of Raw , the World Heavyweight Championship became vacant for the first time . At New Year 's Revolution , Triple H won the Elimination Chamber to begin his tenth world title reign . At WrestleMania 21 , Triple H lost the championship to Batista , and subsequently lost two rematches at Backlash and Vengeance . After Vengeance , Triple H took a hiatus from WWE due to suffering from minor neck problems . After four-month hiatus , Triple H returned to Raw on October 3 , 2005 as part of WWE Homecoming . He teamed with fellow Evolution member Flair to defeat Chris Masters and Carlito . After the match , Triple H turned on Flair hitting Flair with a sledgehammer , sparking a feud between the duo . Flair defeated Triple H in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday for Flair 's Intercontinental Championship . Subsequently , Triple H defeated Flair in a non-title Last Man Standing match at Survivor Series to end their feud . = = = = D-Generation X reunion ( 2006 \u2013 2007 ) = = = = Although Triple H failed to win the Royal Rumble match at the Royal Rumble , another championship opportunity arose for Triple H in the Road to WrestleMania Tournament . He won the tournament , granting him a match for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 22 , where Triple H and John Cena fought in the main event for the title , which Triple H lost via submission . Later that month at Backlash , Triple H was involved in another WWE Championship match , fighting Edge and Cena in a triple threat match , where he lost again . Angered at his loss , a bloodied Triple H used his sledgehammer to attack both Edge and Cena and then performed a number of DX crotch chops . Triple H unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE title from Cena on numerous occasions , blaming his shortcomings on Vince McMahon , which eventually led to a feud between the McMahons and Triple H. Shawn Michaels returned on the June 12 episode of Raw and soon reunited with Triple H to reform D-Generation X , turning Triple H into a fan favorite once again for the first time since 2002 . DX defeated The Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a 5-on-2 handicap match . They continued their feud with Mr. McMahon , Shane McMahon and The Spirit Squad for several weeks . They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 18 , 2006 episode of Saturday Night 's Main Event in a 5-on-2 elimination match . They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam , withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted them before the match aas directed by Mr. McMahon . At Unforgiven , D-Generation X then defeated the McMahons and ECW World Champion Big Show in a 3-on-2 handicap Hell in a Cell match . During the match , DX embarrassed Vince by shoving his face in between Big Show 's buttocks , and DX won when Triple H broke a sledgehammer over the shoulders of Mr. McMahon after Michaels performed a Sweet Chin Music on him . At Cyber Sunday during DX 's feud with Rated-RKO , special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal use of a weapon to give Rated-RKO the win . At Survivor Series , DX got their revenge when their team defeated Edge and Orton 's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match . In January 2007 , at New Year 's Revolution , DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps ( similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg ) 15 minutes into the match . Surgery was successfully performed on January 9 , 2007 by Dr. James Andrews . = = = = WWE Champion ( 2007 \u2013 2009 ) = = = = Triple H made his return at SummerSlam , where he defeated King Booker . Two months later at No Mercy , Triple H was originally scheduled to face Umaga in a singles match . However , at the start of the night , Triple H decided to challenge newly named WWE Champion Randy Orton , reigniting his rivalry with Orton that had been interrupted following his injury . Triple H won the match , winning his eleventh world championship and sixth WWE Championship , and then defended his title against Umaga in his regularly scheduled match after Mr. McMahon declared the match to be for the WWE title . After that McMahon gave Orton a rematch against Triple H in a Last Man Standing match in the main event , and Triple H lost after failing to beat the ten count when Orton hit his RKO onto the announcer 's table . Triple H 's title reign at No Mercy is the fifth shortest reign in WWE history , only lasting through the duration of the event . After winning the Raw Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out , Triple H gained a WWE Championship match by outlasting five other men , last eliminating Jeff Hardy after a Pedigree on a steel chair . However , at WrestleMania XXIV , Orton retained after punting Triple H and pinning John Cena following Triple H 's Pedigree on Cena . A month later , at Backlash , Triple H won the title in a fatal four-way elimination match against Orton , Cena , and John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield , tying the record for most WWE Championship reigns with The Rock . Triple H then retained the title against Orton at Judgment Day in a steel cage match and again at One Night Stand in a Last Man Standing match . Orton suffered a legitimate collarbone injury during the match , thus ending the feud prematurely . Triple H then went on to defeat cleanly John Cena to successfully defend the WWE Championship at Night of Champions . On the June 23 episode of Raw , Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand as a part of the 2008 WWE draft , in the process making the WWE Championship exclusive to SmackDown . He defended the championship over the summer by defeating the likes of Edge at The Great American Bash and The Great Khali at SummerSlam , and was the only champion to retain his title at Unforgiven 's Championship Scramble matches . After this , he successfully defended it against Jeff Hardy both at No Mercy and Cyber Sunday . At Survivor Series , Triple H was scheduled to defend the championship against Vladimir Kozlov and Jeff Hardy , but Hardy was kept out of the match after a scripted attack and injury . During the match , SmackDown general manager Vickie Guerrero announced that Edge had returned and introduced him into the contest . Hardy interfered and hit Triple H with a steel chair meant for Edge , thus costing him the title after a 210 days reign and resulting in Edge winning his sixth world title . After failing to regain the title at Armageddon , Triple H entered seventh in the 2009 Royal Rumble , but was last eliminated by Randy Orton .

Ross asked Triple H how he felt seeing that footage , in response , he broke character ( after 5 years of marriage ) by admitting that Vince McMahon is his father-in-law , that Shane is his brother-in-law , and that Stephanie is his wife , thus creating a rivalry between Triple H and Orton . On the February 23 episode of Raw , Triple H confronted Orton , before attacking him , Ted DiBiase , and Cody Rhodes ( a group known as The Legacy ) with a sledgehammer and chasing them from the arena . At WrestleMania XXV , Triple H defeated Orton to retain the title . He , with Shane McMahon and Batista , then faced Orton and The Legacy in a six-man tag match for the WWE Championship at Backlash .

Triple H agreed to it only if the charges were dropped , which Hornswoggle agreed to .

This was followed by the announcement that he had been assigned to take over as Chief Operating Officer ( COO ) of the WWE . This was during a storyline where CM Punk had won the WWE Championship and left the company . Though a new champion was crowned , Triple H helped re-sign Punk and upheld both championship reigns . He announced he would referee a match to unify both WWE Championships at SummerSlam . Although he counted a pinfall for CM Punk to win , John Cena 's leg was on the ropes , which would break the pin . Regardless , Triple H 's longtime friend Kevin Nash attacked Punk immediately after the match to allow Alberto Del Rio to become the new champion . Though Nash and Punk demanded a match against each other , Triple H fired Nash for insubordination and booked himself in a No Disqualification match at Night of Champions with his position of COO on the line . He won the match despite interference from John Laurinaitis , Nash , The Miz and R-Truth . After repeated attacks from these wrestlers in various matches , the majority of WWE 's on-screen staff gave Triple H a vote of no confidence . Mr. McMahon returned to relieve him of his duties on Raw , though he remained the COO . He was replaced as general manager of Raw by Laurinaitis , who booked him in a tag team match against Miz and R-Truth at Vengeance .

Upon his return two weeks later , Triple H was confronted by Lesnar 's legal representative , Paul Heyman , who announced Lesnar was filing a lawsuit against WWE for breach of contract . After he accosted Heyman , Heyman threatened another lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery . At the No Way Out in June , Triple H challenged Lesnar , who was not present , to a match at SummerSlam , which Heyman refused on Lesnar 's behalf the following night on Raw . At Raw 1000 , Stephanie McMahon managed to goad Heyman into accepting her husband 's challenge against Lesnar . To anger Triple H , Lesnar broke his best friend Shawn Michaels 's arm on the August 13 episode of Raw . Six days later at SummerSlam , Lesnar defeated Triple H via submission after once again breaking his arm in the storyline . On the August 27 episode of Raw , Triple H was supposed to address his potential retirement , but did not make a definitive decision .

Triple H went on to win the match after hitting Lesnar with a Pedigree onto the steel steps . On the April 15 episode of Raw , Heyman challenged Triple H to face Lesnar in a steel cage match at Extreme Rules , which Triple H accepted the following week .

In response , Triple H stormed out the arena and vowed to return to the ring the next week on Raw . On that episode , he lost to Axel when McMahon dubiously disqualified him , ordered Axel to leave the ring , then stole the bell and microphone to prevent the match from being restarted . = = = = The Authority ( 2013 \u2013 2015 ) = = = = On the August 12 episode of Raw , Triple H announced that he would be the special guest referee of the SummerSlam main event : the WWE Championship match between champion John Cena and Daniel Bryan , before giving original referee Brad Maddox a Pedigree . At the event , after Bryan won the match and the title , Triple H would give Bryan a Pedigree so that Randy Orton could cash in his Money in the Bank and win the title , therefore turning heel for the first time since 2006 . Along with his wife Stephanie , they created The Authority , with The Shield as his enforcers and later Kane joining as the Director of Operations . Over the coming weeks he set up handicap matches against any wrestlers who questioned his decisions , such as Big Show and Dolph Ziggler , even firing Cody Rhodes in retaliation for the latter 's insolence . On the October 7 episode of Raw , after \" firing \" Big Show , Show knocked him out in retaliation and was carried out by officials out of the arena . At the 2013 Slammy Awards , Triple H immediately performed a Pedigree on Orton after Bryan shoved him into Stephanie McMahon , despite Orton 's shock . At WrestleMania XXX , Triple H lost to Bryan , thereby granting Bryan a part in the subsequent title match against Batista and champion Randy Orton . Triple H assaulted Bryan after the match and later attempted to prevent Bryan from winning the title by interfering and recruiting Scott Armstrong as a crooked referee , but these attempts were unsuccessful as Bryan won the title by making Batista submit . In order to end Bryan 's title reign , Triple H reformed Evolution with Orton and Batista on the April 18 episode of SmackDown , but Bryan remained champion due to The Shield turning on The Authority . At Extreme Rules , Evolution lost to The Shield and again at Payback in a No Holds Barred elimination match . On the June 2 episode of Raw , Batista would leave the group after Triple H refused to grant him his shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship . Triple H would then resort to \" Plan B \" , which would be Seth Rollins turning on The Shield and rejoining The Authority . On the October 27 episode of Raw , Triple H would offer John Cena a chance to join forces with The Authority , which Cena refused .

After being out of power for a month , Rollins coaxed Cena into reinstating The Authority on the December 29 episode of Raw , by holding Raw guest host Edge hostage with Big Show . On the January 19 episode of Raw , Cena would defeat Rollins , Kane and Big Show in a handicap match when Sting distracted The Authority , allowing Cena to pin Rollins and win back the jobs of Ziggler , Ryback and Erick Rowan , who had been fired two weeks previously by Triple H and Stephanie .

At WrestleMania , Triple H defeated Sting with interference from D-Generation-X , but shook hands with Sting after the match . After his match with Sting , he and Stephanie McMahon were later confronted by The Rock and Ronda Rousey during a promo regarding the record crowd at the event . Throughout 2015 , Triple H maintained his role as the leader of The Authority , and was involved in mediating issues between Seth Rollins and Kane . Over the summer , Triple H began to test Rollins by having him defend the championship against Roman Reigns , Brock Lesnar , John Cena , and Sting . After Rollins suffered a legitimate severe knee injury at a live event , the WWE World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and it was announced that there would be a tournament to determine a new champion at Survivor Series . On the November 9 episode of Raw , Triple H offered to give Reigns a bye to the finals of the tournament if he joined The Authority , but Reigns refused . At Survivor Series , Reigns defeated Dean Ambrose in the tournament finals to become WWE World Heavyweight Champion . Triple H came out and attempted to congratulate Reigns , but was instead speared by him . This allowed Sheamus to cash in his Money in the Bank contract and quickly defeat Reigns to win the championship , resulting in Sheamus aligning with The Authority . = = = = WWE World Heavyweight Champion & Hiatus ( 2015 \u2013 Present ) = = = = The Authority made a rematch between Reigns and Sheamus for the title on the November 30 episode of Raw , with the stipulation that Dean Ambrose and The Usos would lose their Intercontinental Championship and WWE Tag Team Championship title shots if Reigns failed to win the match in under 5 minutes and 15 seconds ( which was the length Reigns ' title reign at Survivor Series ) ; Reigns won by disqualification , allowing Ambrose and The Usos to keep their title shots . At the TLC : Tables , Ladders and Chairs pay-per-view , Sheamus retained the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Reigns due to interference from The League of Nations .

                    "text": "One Night Stand ( 2007 ) = One Night Stand ( 2007 ) was the third annual One Night Stand professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and presented by Gilette . It took place on June 3 , 2007 , at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville , Florida and featured talent from the Raw , SmackDown ! , and ECW brands . The event was the final to announce each individual brand as co-promoters of the event during the introductory graphics . The main match on the Raw brand was John Cena versus The Great Khali in a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Championship . Cena won the match and retained the WWE Championship after pinning Khali following an FU off a crane onto the arena floor . The featured match on the SmackDown ! brand was Edge versus Batista in a Steel Cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship , which Edge won after escaping the cage . The primary match on the ECW brand was Vince McMahon versus Bobby Lashley in a Street Fight for the ECW Championship , which Lashley won by pinfall after performing a spear . The featured matches on the undercard included Rob Van Dam versus Randy Orton in a Stretcher match and a Ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship between The Hardys ( Matt and Jeff ) and The World 's Greatest Tag Team ( Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas ) . = = Background = = The main feud heading into One Night Stand on the Raw brand was between John Cena and The Great Khali , with the two battling over the WWE Championship . This was a rematch of their encounter at Judgment Day , the pay-per-view two weeks before One Night Stand . At the event , Cena defeated Khali by forcing him to submit to the STFU . When Khali submitted to the STFU , however , his feet were underneath the bottom rope , meaning Cena should have broken the submission hold . Referee Mike Chioda was focusing on Khali 's arm and did not see Khali 's feet underneath the bottom rope . The following night on Raw , believing he should not have lost the match , Khali challenged Cena to a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match . Following Cena 's acceptance , Khali performed a Chokebomb on Cena . Heading into One Night Stand , Khali used the Chokebomb again to win a non-title match against Cena on the June 2 edition of Saturday Night 's Main Event . The predominant feud on the SmackDown ! brand heading into the pay-per-view was between Edge and Batista , with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship . The two fought each other at Judgment Day for the title , and Edge won the bout with a school boy pin . On the May 25 episode of SmackDown ! , General Manager Theodore Long announced that Edge would defend the World Heavyweight Championship in a Steel Cage match at One Night Stand . Batista won a Fatal Four-Way match against Finlay , Kane , and Mark Henry to earn the spot of the challenger at the pay-per-view . Batista was a guest on Edge 's talk show The Cutting Edge on the June 1 episode of SmackDown ! . Towards the end of the segment , Batista punched Edge and sent him to the floor . The following night , on Saturday Night 's Main Event , Batista and Chris Benoit defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter ( MVP ) in a tag team match . During the match , Edge walked out , leaving MVP on his own against Batista and Benoit . Benoit gained the pinfall after performing a flying headbutt on MVP . The other primary feud featured on the One Night Stand card consisted of both Raw and ECW superstars . ECW 's Bobby Lashley battled Raw 's Vince McMahon for the ECW World Championship . Lashley faced Team McMahon ( ECW World Champion Vince McMahon , Shane , and Umaga ) in a 3-on-1 tag team Handicap match at Judgment Day , with the ECW World Championship on the line . Lashley won the match , pinning Shane after a Dominator powerslam . After the match , however , Vince declared that Lashley had not won the title and that he was still the ECW World Champion , as he had not been pinned . In the match , Lashley could have won the title , but not a member of Team McMahon . The following night , on the May 21 edition of Raw , Lashley was put into a Gauntlet match by Vince McMahon , with the stipulation that if he won all four of the matches in the gauntlet , he would face Vince at One Night Stand . Lashley won all four matches , defeating Chris Masters , Viscera , Umaga and Shane McMahon in succession . As a result , Lashley gained a title shot at One Night Stand in a Street Fight . On the May 28 edition of Raw , Lashley teamed with WWE Champion John Cena to take on Umaga , Shane McMahon and The Great Khali in a Handicap match . Shane won the match , pinning Lashley after an elbow drop . Vince was scheduled to face Lashley in an arm wrestling contest on the June 2 edition of Saturday Night 's Main Event . Moments before the contest began , however , Vince booked Mark Henry as Lashley 's opponent instead . During the contest , Vince attacked Lashley , hitting him with a steel chair . = = Event = = Before the event went live on pay-per-view , Santino Marella defeated Chris Masters in a dark match . = = = Preliminary matches = = = The first match that aired was a Stretcher match between Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam , in which the object is to place your opponent on a stretcher and wheel the stretcher across a finish line . The match went back and forth before Van Dam attempted to perform a Somersault Plancha onto Orton , but Orton moved out of the way . Orton put Van Dam on the stretcher and tried to wheel him across the finishing line . Van Dam , however , managed to kick Orton in the head and put him onto the stretcher . Van Dam wheeled the stretcher over the line for the win . After the match , Orton attacked Van Dam , executing an Elevated DDT off the barricade onto the arena floor . Van Dam was then carried out of the arena on the stretcher . Next was a Tables match , as CM Punk and The ECW Originals ( Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman ) faced The New Breed ( Elijah Burke , Matt Striker and Marcus Cor Von ) . In order to win the match , one team must put a member of the other team through a table . Towards the end of the contest , Cor Von attempted to put Punk through the table with an Alpha Bomb , but Sandman hit Cor Von with a Singapore cane . With Burke on the table , Punk performed a suplex on Striker off the top rope and through the table and Burke , thus winning the contest . The third match was a Ladder match for the World Tag Team Championship , as The Hardys ( Matt and Jeff ) faced The World 's Greatest Tag Team ( Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas ) . The object of the match is to climb a ladder and retrieve the title belts suspended above the ring . The Hardys had the advantage for most of the contest , but as Jeff was climbing the ladder to try and grab the belts , Benjamin botched a springboard attempt . Benjamin managed to kick the ladder from underneath Jeff , however , to gain control . The Hardys managed to regain the advantage by pushing the ladder as The World 's Greatest Tag Team were climbing it , which in turn caused Benjamin to fall to the arena floor . Jeff performed a Swanton bomb on Haas as Matt climbed up the ladder to get the belts and win the match . Next on the card was Mark Henry versus Kane in a Lumberjack match with twelve lumberjacks at ringside ; Chris Benoit , Val Venis , Santino Marella , Balls Mahoney , Stevie Richards , The Miz , Kevin Thorn , Chris Masters , Johnny Nitro , Chavo Guerrero , Kenny Dykstra and Carlito . Kane chokeslamed Henry towards the end of the contest and attempted to pin Henry . Chavo Guerrero and Kenny Dykstra interfered , however , and attacked Kane . Kane fought back and chokeslammed Dykstra , but Henry locked Kane in a bear hug . The referee stopped the contest after Kane kayfabe passed out . = = = Main event matches = = = The ECW World Championship match was next , as ECW Champion Vince McMahon ( accompanied by Shane McMahon and Umaga ) faced Bobby Lashley in a Street Fight . Shane and Umaga interfered in the match , helping Vince gain the advantage . Shane performed a flying elbow drop , sending Lashley through the announce table at ringside . Back inside the ring , as Umaga was holding a trash can in front of Lashley 's face in the corner , Shane attempted to execute the Coast-to-Coast dropkick ; however , Lashley moved out of the way , and Shane dropkicked the trash can into Umaga 's face . Team McMahon kept the upper hand , as Umaga performed a Samoan Drop onto Lashley , which was followed by a spear from Vince . Lashley , however , gained the upper hand by hitting Vince several times with a steel chair . Lashley performed a spear on Shane and followed with a spear to Vince before pinning Vince to gain the victory and become the new ECW World Champion . A Pudding match was next , as Candice Michelle faced WWE Women 's Champion Melina . Candice forced Melina to submit by holding her head under the pudding . This was followed by Edge versus Batista in a Steel Cage match for the World Heavyweight Championship , which could be won by either pinfall , submission , or escaping the cage . During the first few minutes of the contest , Edge attempted to escape the cage several times but was stopped by Batista . Batista gained the advantage after a suplex to Edge off the top rope . Edge gained the upper hand late in the contest , performing a spear to Batista , but failed to get the pinfall . Batista regained the advantage and attempted to perform the Batista Bomb , but Edge reversed the move . Edge climbed over the top of the cage while Batista crawled towards the door . Edge 's feet hit the arena floor first , and he was declared the winner and retained his title . The final match was a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match for the WWE Championship , as John Cena defended against The Great Khali . Khali had control for most of the contest , performing a spin kick and a leg drop onto Cena . The contest went into the crowd , as Khali hit Cena with a television monitor . Cena gained the advantage , swinging the boom camera by the crew set into Khali . Cena attempted to perform the FU , but Khali blocked it with his elbow . Khali regained the upper hand , scoop slamming Cena onto a crane . Cena fought back while on the crane and performed an FU to Khali off the crane onto the arena floor . Cena got the pinfall and the victory . = = Aftermath = = A storyline involving Vince McMahon 's \" death \" began the following night on Raw . He appeared traumatized from losing the ECW World Championship , acting strangely as a result . This behavior continued in McMahon 's appearances on all brands and culminated in a segment on the June 11 edition of Raw with McMahon entering a limousine moments before it exploded . On the June 25 edition of Raw , Vince McMahon revealed that his death was part of a storyline , and that Chris Benoit and his family were legitimately dead . The show , originally scheduled to be a three-hour special dedicated to McMahon 's \" death , \" was dedicated to Benoit and highlighted matches throughout his career . The WWE Draft also took place on Raw and resulted in The Great Khali being drafted to SmackDown ! , thus ending his feud with John Cena . Bobby Lashley was drafted to Raw and was forced to relinquish his ECW World Championship . Lashley , along with King Booker , Randy Orton and Mick Foley entered a feud with John Cena . On the June 18 episode of Raw , all men began cutting promos on how they deserved to be the number one contender to the WWE Championship . On the June 8 episode of SmackDown ! , Vince McMahon announced that Edge would be defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista in a \" Last Chance \" match at Vengeance . On an episode of SmackDown ! , Batista and Ric Flair defeated Edge and Montel Vontavious Porter ( MVP ) . Midway through the match , Flair and MVP brawled outside the ring , leaving Edge on his own against Batista . Batista gained the pinfall after hitting Edge with a Batista Bomb . As part of the WWE Draft , Chris Benoit was drafted from SmackDown ! to ECW . In his debut on the ECW brand , Benoit teamed up with CM Punk in a tag team match against Elijah Burke and Marcus Cor Von , in which Benoit and Punk won . On the June 19 episode of ECW , an ECW qualifying match was held in which it would determine the opponents for Vengeance for the vacant ECW title .

That same night , CM Punk went on to defeat Marcus Cor Von to advanced to the finals . At Vengeance , Benoit was replaced by Johnny Nitro , after he withdrew from the match for \" personal reasons \" . At the event , Nitro defeated Punk to win the vacant ECW title . = = Results = =",

                    "text": "Gregory Helms = Gregory Shane Helms ( born July 12 , 1974 ) is an American professional wrestler who is currently signed to Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) under his birth name . In TNA , he is the manager for former TNA X Division Champion Trevor Lee . He is best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) , where he wrestled as The Hurricane , Gregory Helms , and Hurricane Helms and also for his time with World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) , where he wrestled as \" Sugar \" Shane Helms . Helms first began wrestling in 1991 at the age of 16 , and wrestled in numerous independent promotions , including the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts , winning numerous light heavyweight and tag team championships . In 1999 , he signed with WCW , and gained fame as \" Sugar \" Shane Helms , a member of 3 Count . During his time there he won both the WCW Hardcore Championship and the WCW Cruiserweight Championship . When WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF , now WWE ) , Helms ' contract was kept by WWF . Helms renamed himself \" The Hurricane \" and won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship . He later picked up a sidekick , Rosey , and they won the World Tag Team Championship together . He dropped the superhero gimmick in 2005 , and began wrestling under his real name . He once again won the Cruiserweight Championship in early 2006 , and held it for over a year , becoming the longest reigning Cruiserweight Champion and the longest reigning champion of any kind in SmackDown history . After being out of action for over a year after neck fusion surgery Helms returned to SmackDown in September 2008 , referring to himself as Hurricane Helms , before moving to the ECW brand where he reverted to his Gregory Helms name , and became the backstage interviewer . In mid-2009 , he brought back The Hurricane character , and appeared as both Gregory Helms and The Hurricane on ECW . After ECW was cancelled , Helms was released by WWE on February 26 , 2010 , and returned to the independent circuit . = = Professional wrestling career = = = = = Early career ( 1991 \u2013 1999 ) = = = Helms began wrestling at the age of 16 in 1991 . He won his first championship shortly afterwards , by defeating \" Playboy \" T.C. Cruise to become the Southern Wrestling Alliance ( SWA ) Light Heavyweight Champion . Helms spent the majority of his early career in his home state of North Carolina , winning numerous light heavyweight championships . Helms began calling himself \" The Show \" Shane Helms , and teamed with \" Big Daddy \" Mike Maverick , initially using the team name Assault and Battery . They later dubbed themselves The Serial Thrillaz , and won several independent tag championships . The pair also began wrestling in the Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts ( OMEGA ) , which was founded by The Hardy Boyz ( Matt and Jeff ) . The Serial Thrillaz won the OMEGA Tag Team Championship twice between 1997 and 1998 , before they began competing for Southern Championship Wrestling ( SCW ) . They won the SCW Tag Team Championship , and Helms also won the SCW Heavyweight Championship . SCW would mark the end of the Serial Thrillaz , as Helms vacated both titles before moving on to NWA Worldwide . Once there , Helms joined the Bad Street Boys with Shannon Moore , Christian York , and Joey Matthews . = = = World Championship Wrestling ( 1999 \u2013 2001 ) = = = Helms and his friend Shannon Moore signed with World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) in May 1999 . In WCW , Helms , along with Moore and Evan Karagias , formed the heel ( villainous ) stable ( faction ) 3 Count , and the trio debuted on the December 23 episode of WCW Thunder . The trio was a parody of the boy bands ' N Sync and the Backstreet Boys , and their gimmick involved making music videos and performing songs before their matches . 3 Count collectively won the WCW Hardcore Championship on WCW Monday Nitro in February 2000 . This win made 3 Count the first trio to win the Hardcore Championship . At Uncensored , Brian Knobbs defeated all members of 3 Count to win the Hardcore Championship . During a match , Helms suffered a broken nose , and was sidelined while he recovered . Upon his return , Tank Abbott had been added to the group , as a fan , and was utilized in an enforcer role . 3 Count had a long-running feud ( scripted rivalry ) with The Jung Dragons , with the Dragons attempting to steal 3 Count 's fictional recording contract . This led to a ladder match between the two teams at New Blood Rising , which 3 Count won due to Abbott 's interference . As a result , Abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 Count , and was kicked out by the other three members , leading to a feud . 3 Count later disbanded as Moore and Helms kicked Karagias out of the group for attempting to steal the spotlight . At the same time , the Jung Dragons turned on Jamie Noble , who formed a team with Karagias . The three teams met in a Triangle match at Mayhem , which 3 Count won . They also wrestled each other in a number one contendership ladder match at Starrcade , to earn a WCW Cruiserweight Championship match , in which both Moore and Helms grabbed the contract at the same time . As a result , they later wrestled for the opportunity to wrestle for the championship , which Helms won , although he lost the subsequent championship match to Chavo Guerrero at the Sin pay-per-view . Moore and Helms would leave WCW briefly in 2001 to wrestle in NWA Wildside , where they held the Wildside Tag Team Championship for one day . Helms became the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship after winning a match at SuperBrawl Revenge , but was attacked by Karagias and Moore afterwards . Despite the attack , Helms would go on to defeat Guerrero for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship at Greed and was the reigning Cruiserweight Champion immediately before WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . Helms ' contract with WCW was one of twenty-five that were included in WWF 's purchase of WCW . = = = World Wrestling Federation / Entertainment = = = = = = = Early appearances ( 2001 \u2013 2002 ) = = = = Helms made his WWF debut on the July 5 , 2001 episode of SmackDown ! , using the name \" Hollywood \" Gregory Helms . He was part of the Invasion storyline as a member of The Alliance losing his Cruiserweight Championship in a one-on-one match to another Alliance member , Billy Kidman . Helms began wrestling as \" The Hurricane \" on August 27 , and also began wearing a superhero costume . That night , he won the WWF European Championship from Matt Hardy with help from Ivory , but lost it to Bradshaw on October 22 , 2001 . In September 2001 , Helms formed a tag team with Lance Storm who was now managed by Ivory and Helms later picked up a sidekick , in Molly Holly who began to call herself \" Mighty Molly \" , and the two came to the arena in a custom \" Hurri-Cycle \" ( with Molly in the sidecar ) . The team of Helms and Storm began feuds with teams like The Hardy Boyz and Big Show and Spike Dudley . Helms and Storm got a shot at the WCW Tag Team Championship against The Hardy Boyz at No Mercy in a losing effort . During 2002 , The Hurricane won the WWF Hardcore Championship at WrestleMania X8 , but Molly betrayed him , hitting him in the back of the head with a frying pan , and defeating him for the championship . Helms was later drafted to the SmackDown ! brand following the brand extension , and he won the Cruiserweight Championship from Tajiri and Billy Kidman in a triple threat match . He lost it to Jamie Noble at King of the Ring . Later in 2002 , he was traded to Raw , won the World Tag Team Championship with Kane , and held them for around a month in an alliance known as Hurri-Kane . = = = = Teaming with Rosey ( 2003 \u2013 2005 ) = = = = In 2003 , Hurricane feuded with The Rock . In backstage segments , The Rock referred to The Hurricane as \" The Hamburglar \" ( in part because his mask was similar to the Hamburglar 's ) . The feud culminated in a match on Raw , in which The Rock dominated . Hurricane , however , was able to roll up The Rock from behind after The Rock was distracted by Stone Cold Steve Austin 's appearance on the ramp . In late 2003 , Hurricane \" discovered \" Rosey 's potential as a superhero and christened him \" Rosey , the Super Hero in Training \" ( the \" S.H.I.T. \" ) . On May 1 , at Backlash , Rosey and The Hurricane defeated La R\u00e9sistance in the finals of a Tag Team Turmoil match to win the World Tag Team Championship . Not long after winning the championship , Stacy Keibler joined Rosey and The Hurricane as their sidekick , \" Super Stacy \" . In August 2005 , Rosey and The Hurricane lost Keibler as their sidekick when she and Christy Hemme were traded to the SmackDown ! brand . On September 5 , 2005 Hurricane and Rosey were defeated by Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch during Cade and Murdoch 's debut match on Raw . As a result , Cade and Murdoch earned a title match at the Unforgiven pay-per-view . During the title match , Murdoch delivered an elevated DDT on The Hurricane to the outside . The DDT caused Hurricane to suffer a storyline \" stinger \" and allowed Cade and Murdoch to beat the injured Hurricane later in the match to win the World Tag Team Titles . During the next few weeks , the pair began a losing streak , mainly caused by Hurricane 's on-screen injuries . During the October 17 episode of Raw , The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of Vince McMahon . After the beating , footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle . The next week , The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match , leaving Rosey to face the champions alone . During the match , The Hurricane ( out of costume ) appeared at the top of the entrance ramp , reverting to his real name , Gregory Helms , and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated . After the match , Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd , and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner . This turned him into a heel in the process . On the November 7 episode of Raw , Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match , which Helms won . Subsequently , Helms wrestled mostly on Raw 's sister show , Heat . On the January 2 , 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms ' expense , and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane , he was entertaining and called Helms a joke . Helms responded by slapping Lawler , who hit Helms back . This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year 's Revolution . = = = = Cruiserweight Champion and injury ( 2006 \u2013 2007 ) = = = = At the 2006 Royal Rumble , Helms participated in an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won , even though he was a Raw superstar and the championship was defended solely on SmackDown ! . As a result , he returned to the SmackDown ! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio , Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights . During this time , Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match . The next week , he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash , but Kash was away on a family emergency , so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place . Helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights . As a result , all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms . It was later announced by SmackDown ! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event , Helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title . Helms was able to retain the championship . Later , Long mandated that Helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown ! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights . Helm 's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools ; Helms retained by cheating . In early March 2006 , Helms suffered a broken nose . After complaining to Long about having to wrestle on the March 10 episode of SmackDown ! , Long told Helms that he did not have to defend his title , but put Helms in a champion versus champion match against the United States Champion , Chris Benoit . During the match , Helms attempted to leave , but was blocked by other cruiserweights who threw Helms back into the ring , resulting in Helms losing the match . Helms underwent successful surgery on his nose and was expected to miss five to six weeks . During this time SmackDown ! announcers stated that Helms had a no-compete clause in his contract allowing him to waive the thirty-day title defense rule due to any injury . Helms returned to the ring on the April 28 episode of SmackDown ! , teaming with MNM to face Super Crazy , London and Kendrick in a six-man tag team match . Helms continued to defend his belt during pay-per-views , but he made more regular appearances on SmackDown ! ' s sister show , Velocity . Helms continued defending his title against other cruiserweights , while on occasion facing off against SmackDown ! ' s other title holders in champion versus champion matches . Helms faced World Heavyweight Champion Rey Mysterio on June 16 and United States Champion Bobby Lashley on July 7 but lost both matches . Eventually , Helms became the longest cruiserweight champion in WWE history , as well as the longest reigning champion of any kind in SmackDown ! history . For much of late 2006 , he feuded with Matt Hardy , with whom Helms exchanged several victories in matches on SmackDown ! . In Helms ' hometown of Raleigh , North Carolina , at the 2006 No Mercy pay-per-view , Hardy beat Helms . The two rivals also joined opposing teams at Survivor Series , where Helms was in Team Rated-RKO , and Hardy was a member of Team DX ; Team Rated-RKO lost the match . Helms went on to feud with Jimmy Wang Yang over the Cruiserweight Title , after a tag team match in which Matt Hardy and Yang defeated Helms and Sylvan . The feud ended after Helms defeated him to retain the title at Armageddon in December 2006 . In 2007 , Helms once again feuded with the entire Cruiserweight division on SmackDown ! . During this feud , Helms ' reign as Cruiserweight Champion came to an end at No Way Out , when he was unable to win a Cruiserweight open invitational , which saw Chavo Guerrero win the championship . Shortly after losing the championship , Helms formed a tag team with Guerrero , but they did not win any matches as a team . On May 18 , 2007 , WWE reported that Helms had broken two vertebrae in his neck , one of which was pressing on his spinal cord . He underwent surgery with Dr. Lloyd Youngblood to repair them approximately a week later .

Working in the Mini-Estrella division does not automatically mean that Espetrito has Dwarfism as several wrestlers who are just shorter in stature work in the \" Mini \" division . Espantito 's real name is not a matter of public record , as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans . Espantito made his professional wrestling debut in 1993 and was allowed to use a version of the Espanto mask and name with permission of the only surviving Espanto , Espanto III . He has worked primarily on the Mexican independent circuit but has also worked for Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n ( AAA ) , one of Mexico 's largest professional wrestling promotions . = = Personal life = = The man only known as \" Espantito \" ( Spanish for \" Little Terror \" or \" Little Scare \" ) was born on April 25 , 1968 in Torre\u00f3n , Coahuila , Mexico . Growing up in Torre\u00f3n he became a wrestling fan at a young age , often watching local wrestlers Espanto II and Espanto III wrestle in his home town . In a 1999 interview he remarked that while his friends would cheer the t\u00e9cnicos ( the faces , those that portray the \" good guys \" ) while he personally always favored the rudos ( those that portray the bad guys , also known as \" Heels \" ) . While he wanted to become a luchador , it was hard for him to find a trainer willing to train someone of his diminutive stature , standing only 151 cm ( 4 ft 11 in ) in his teens . = = Classified as a Mini-Estrella = = While the wrestler known as Espantito is known as a Mini-Estrella ( \" Mini-Star ) it does not indicate that Espantito has Dwarfism . Unlike Midget professional wrestling where all competitors are under the height of 147 cm ( 4 ft 10 in ) , Mini-Estrellas are often wrestlers of shorter stature such as Espantito at 160 cm ( 5 ft 3 in ) , but not true Little People in a medical sense . = = Professional wrestling career = = Due to the secretive culture around masked wrestlers in Lucha libre Espantito 's real name is not a matter of common knowledge , nor has it been revealed if he worked under a different ring name before he made his in-ring debut as Espantito . It has been confirmed that Espantito trained in his native Torre\u00f3n , Coahuila under the tutelage of Edgardo Cisneros D\u00edaz , better known as Espanto II and also received further training from Indio Chirikawa . In the early 1990s the Mini-Estrella concept was introduced in Mexico , featuring not just Midget professional wrestling but also wrestlers who were short in stature . A lot of these new Mini-Estrellas used the same ring character as regular sized wrestlers such as Octagoncito being a smaller version of Octag\u00f3n . Due to his short stature , 160 cm ( 5 ft 3 in ) , the future Espantito became a natural fit in the Mini-Estrellas division and was given permission by his trainer to start working as a smaller version of Los Espantos ( \" The Terriors \" ) and became known as El Espantito , wearing the signature black mask with a white cross on it popularized by Espanto I , Espanto II and Espanto III as well as the same black-and-white ring gear of the originals . As Espantito he was one of the first competitors in the newly created Asistencia Asesor\u00eda y Administraci\u00f3n 's ( AAA ) Mini-Estrella division . Most of AAA 's Mini-Estrella division consisted of luchadors that had followed AAA founder Antonio Pe\u00f1a from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( CMLL ) , where some of the Mini-Estrellas changed their name and mask due to the larger version of the character not jumping to AAA at the time . One example was Super Mu\u00f1equito , who was working as \" Angelito Azteca \" in CMLL , but had to change his name as \u00c1ngel Azteca did not leavel CMLL . It has not been revealed if Espectrito also worked in the CMLL Mini-Estrella division at the time of the AAA Exodous . For a short while Espantito was teamed up with a wrestler working as \" Espantito II \" , but Espantito II was only used for a few matches in 1993 . Despite working for AAA for several years he never made an appearance on one of their major shows , despite the Mini-Estrella division being featured on several , even headlined some shows . In 1999 Espantito once again briefly teamed up with a wrestler working as \" Espantito II \" , although it is unclear if it was the same worker under the mask than six years prior . By the late 1990s Espantito left AAA and began working primarily on the Mexican Independent circuit , often touring with a troupe of Mini-Estrellas such as Octagoncito , Piratita Morgan and Tzuki . The group toured the U.S. , working for various National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) promotions as well as showcasing lucha libre and the Mini-Estrella style throughout the south-west . On September 20 , 2009 Espantito wrestled Octagoncito for the vacant NWA World Midget 's Championship on a Pro Wrestling Revolution ( PWR ) show , which saw Octagoncito win the match and the championship . The troupe of Mini-Estrellas would continue to ue the NWA World Midget 's Championship as part of their shows , promoting matches where Octagoncito would defend the championship against Espantito . Later on when Pro Wrestling Revolution split from the NWA the championship was re-branded the PWR World Midget 's Championship , with Octagoncito defending it on occasion against Espectrito in various southern states of the United States . = = Legal rights to the Espanto name = = While several wrestlers have used the \" Espanto \" name of the years , El Hijo del Espanto I claims to currently have full rights to the use of the name \" Espanto \" in Lucha Libre , though his claim to the name does not seem all-inclusive as CMLL has Espanto Jr. on their roster . It is unclear if Espantito legally owns the name , or if that was what prevented the \" Espantito II \" name from being used more than once or twice . = = In wrestling = = Finishing moves Plancha ( slingshot crossbody ) Signature moves Plancha suicida ( Diving slingshot outside the ring )",

                    "text": "Soccer kick = A soccer kick , also known as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting , is a reference to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football . It is the colloquial term for a kick performed against a prone , kneeling , rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position , to any part of a downed opponent . The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993 . Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick , which also knocked out one of Tuli 's teeth . The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets , including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them . Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage . There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA . Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them . = = Description = = A soccer kick is performed when a fighter is standing to the side or in front of an opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent 's head . This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football . Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot . While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head , kicks to other parts of the body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks . = = In mixed martial arts = = The soccer kick has been a source of controversy in mixed martial arts since Gerard Gordeau 's usage of one against Teila Tuli in UFC 1 . Dr. Johnny Benjamin stated his belief that soccer kicks could cause serious injury , based on the assumption that an MMA fighter would be able to generate the same amount of force in a soccer kick as a professional association football player . Some MMA fans argue that no-one has ever been seriously injured from a soccer kick and stated that there were already equally dangerous moves allowed in MMA . Dr. Johnny Benjamin argued that soccer kicks could result in broken necks and paralysis if performed with the wrong positioning and high velocity . In 2000 , the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were written with the intention of making the sport of MMA appear more acceptable in a wider society . Under those rules , soccer kicks were explicitly banned and classed as a foul defined as \" kicking the head of a grounded opponent \" . It is noted that while soccer kicks to grounded opponents are fouls , axe kicks , downward strikes with the back of the heel , are not considered fouls if done to any part of a grounded opponent . In the years after the banning of soccer kicks under the Unified Rules , a number of fans and MMA fighters have argued for them to be permitted under the Unified Rules along with face and foot stomps . Their justification is that soccer kicks and foot stomps being disallowed hindered fighters who were used to using them under other MMA rule sets . Mauricio Rua , who mostly used soccer kicks to earn victories in Pride , argued that elbows caused more pain than soccer kicks and claimed that soccer kicks were safer than elbows . Rua also argued that elbows were more dangerous than soccer kicks and yet were allowed under the unified rules . Opponents of soccer kicks argued that they needed to be banned in order for the sport of MMA to move forward . They also argued that in the face of opposition to the sport from politicians such as John McCain , soccer kicks had to be banned in order to ensure that the sport was not viewed as illegal \" human cockfighting \" and could be sanctioned as legal in the United States by Athletic Commissions . Although a soccer kick is a foul when delivered to the head in the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts which prevail in North America , the technique was commonly employed in Pride Fighting Championships in Japan . Fighters Wanderlei Silva and Mauricio Rua were notable practitioners of the soccer kick in MMA . Under the Unified Rules , some MMA fighters attempted to use tactics with the \" kicking the head of a grounded opponent \" rule , which defined a fighter as grounded if they had any part of their body apart from their feet on the ground . This meant that fighters , such as Jon Jones , would often try to provoke illegal soccer kicks by putting their hand on the ground or as a way to avoid strikes such as the soccer kick after a failed takedown . However , in 2013 , referees were encouraged to interpret the rules that if a fighter is deliberately intending to provoke an illegal soccer kick and one was used , then the referee could decide that it was a legal move . There are still MMA organizations such as Singapore-based ONE Fighting Championship that allow soccer kicks to the head of downed opponent . ONE Fighting Championship previously had an \" open attack \" rule , which required fighters to get permission from the referee to use soccer kicks . In 2012 , the company changed its rule set to the rules used by Pride Fighting Championship allowing fighters to use soccer kicks without asking for permission from the referee . = = In professional wrestling = = In professional wrestling , some wrestlers use the soccer kick is as a finishing move . A number of professional wrestlers prior to the 1980s professional wrestling boom were taught to use wrestling moves and strikes legitimately . This was due to the likelihood of attacks on the wrestlers from fans . This included the soccer kick , which former pro-wrestler , CM Punk stated was the easiest tactic to use when a fan tried to get in the ring to confront a wrestler . High profile users of soccer kicks as a finishing move includes Katsuyori Shibata , and Randy Orton . In Japan within a 1977 puroresu match between Antonio Inoki and Great Antonio , Inoki started to shoot on Great Antonio after Great Antonio refused to sell Inoki 's offence . Inoki used a takedown on Great Antonio and then used soccer kicks to legitimately knock out Great Antonio . = = In video games = = In the 2010 video game , EA Sports MMA , soccer kicks were included in the game . In the 2012 video game UFC Undisputed 3 , soccer kicks are included in the game in the Pride mode . This mode was intended to replicate Pride Fighting Championships . This was different compared with the normal UFC mode which does not include soccer kicks due to UFC following the Unified Rules . The soccer kick has also been used in professional wrestling video games . It was used in the 1999 Nintendo 64 game , WWF WrestleMania 2000 .",

                    "text": "Tom Johnson ( bareknuckle boxer ) = Tom Johnson ( born Tom Jackling ; c . 1750 \u2013 21 January 1797 ) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was referred to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791 . His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with a renewed interest in the sport . Although a strong man , his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm , analytical approach to despatching his opponents . But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring ; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark . He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later , but much of it was squandered . Johnson 's first fight probably took place in June 1783 against Jack Jarvis , after he had unintentionally slighted the wagon driver and professional fighter . Jarvis challenged Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour , and was comprehensively beaten in the resulting match . Johnson 's success encouraged him to take up the sport professionally . By June 1784 he had declared himself to be the champion , although whether of England or the world is uncertain . In the later years of his fight career , and for some time after it ended , he acted as a second for other prominent fighters and ran a public house . His dissipation outside the ring appears to have resulted in his decision to leave England for Ireland , where he continued to tutor other boxers but eventually resorted to gambling to earn a living . He died a broken man , both physically and financially . Johnson was inducted into the Pioneer category of the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1995 . = = Life before boxing = = Tom Johnson was born in Derby , England in about 1750 , although at least one early historian of boxing , Pierce Egan , states that Johnson was born in Yorkshire . His birth name was Thomas Jackling , but he used the name Tom Johnson throughout his fight career . Johnson moved to London at a young age and spent the next twenty years or so working as a corn porter , loading and unloading sacks of corn from a wharf near to Old Swan Stairs , ( Upper ) Thames Street . His selflessness and strength were exemplified during this period by the assistance that he gave to a fellow worker who had become ill . Johnson would carry two sacks of corn on each journey between the wharf and the grain warehouse , rather than the usual single sack , up an incline so steep that it was known as Labour-in-vain-hill . He gave the extra money he earned to the family of the sick man until he was able to return work . = = Background to 18th-century prizefighting = = Prizefighting in early 18th-century England took many forms rather than just pugilism , which was referred to by noted swordsman and then boxing champion James Figg as \" the noble science of defence \" . But by the middle of the century the term was generally used to denote boxing fights only . The appeal of prizefighting at that time has been compared to that of duelling ; historian Adrian Harvey says that : Patriotic writers often extolled the manly sports of the British , claiming that they reflected a courageous , robust , individualism in which the nation could take pride . Pugilism was regarded as humane and fair and its practice was presented in chivalrous terms . It was also a symbol of national courage , embodying the worth which Englishmen placed upon their own individual honour . The French , it was argued , did not like pugilism because they were not a free people and relied on the authorities to resolve their disputes . By contrast , the British dealt with their own problems in a straightforward manner , according to established rules of fair play . From a legal standpoint prizefights ran the risk of being classified as disorderly assemblies , but in practice the authorities were mainly concerned about the number of criminals congregating there . Historian Bohun Lynch has been quoted as saying that pickpocketing was rife , and that fights between the various supporters were common . However , the patronage of the aristocracy and the wealthy ensured that any legal scrutiny was generally benign , in particular because fights could take place on private estates . This patronage also explains why London was the centre for the sport ; people of wealth tended to congregate in the city during the winter months and in the summer dispersed to their country estates . From 1786 , just as Johnson was rising to prominence , there was increased support for the sport because of the interest shown in it by the Prince of Wales ( later King George IV ) and his brothers , the future King William IV and Duke of Kent . This renewed interest followed a period of malaise which had in large part been due to corruption in the form of \" fixing \" the fights . Jack Broughton , a celebrated boxing champion ( and another who was also a swordsman ) , had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743 , based on earlier work by Figg , but by Johnson 's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely . The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing ; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their feet in line and their fists raised level in front of them , rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly in front of the other and one fist leading . Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent , a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters ' feet . Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down , with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground . Moving around the ring , known as shifting , was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight ; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won . The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice , and there might also be a third , independent umpire present , to adjudicate between them . = = Career as a fighter = = = = = Early period = = = Johnson probably began fighting in June 1783 , at the age of thirty-three , although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier . Johnson had unintentionally slighted a carman ( horse-drawn wagon driver ) and fighter called Jack Jarvis , who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour . Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock 's Fields , and his name came to the attention of professional fighters . At that time Johnson had no intention of earning a living from the sport , but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784 , at Kennington Common . Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27 minutes and decided to become a professional . The success against the Drover was followed by a victory against the ageing professional Stephen \" Death \" Oliver in June . The fight , which took place at Blackheath in front of thousands of people , was over in a time stated as being either 18 or 35 minutes . Johnson subsequently declared himself to be the champion and challenged all-comers . Most contemporary and near-contemporary accounts , such as those of Egan , regard this title of champion to mean Champion of England but Barrett O 'Hara , writing in 1909 , listed Johnson as the fourteenth World Heavyweight Champion . At the time of Johnson 's victory , the holder of title of champion was disputed . The previous holder , Duggan Fearns , had disappeared and Harry Sellers , the man Fearns had beaten to win the title in a fight that lasted 90 seconds and was alleged to have been fixed , had died . Johnson did not fight again until he beat Bill Love , a butcher , at Barnet on 11 or 13 January 1786 in a contest that lasted five minutes and offered a prize of 50 guineas . He then beat Jack Towers the following month at the same place . The final fight of Johnson 's early period , during which the stake money was relatively low , was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50 guineas at Kingston . The fight , which lasted less than 30 minutes , ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him . This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport ; it took place on 6 June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London . = = = Consolidation = = = Johnson had developed to be an exceptional fighter , and a rarity in his day because he used his brain as well as his strength . A barrel-chested man , he weighed around 196 pounds ( 89 kg ) and his height was variously stated in the range of 5 ' 8 \" ( 1.73 m ) to 5 ' 10 \" ( 1.78 m ) . He was known for his coolness under pressure and he took time to analyse his opponent 's strengths , weaknesses and technique . He did not retreat from the fight but avoided risk and was careful not to expose himself too much to attack , although his guard was described as \" inelegant \" by Egan . That writer also explained that he \" worked round his antagonist in a way peculiar to himself , that so puzzled his adversary to find out his intent , that he was frequently thrown off his guard , by which manoeuvring Johnson often gained the most important advantages . \" All of this meant that his fights were not usually of short duration ; he made certain of the outcome rather than risking anything . Having exhausted challengers in London , he took on Bristolian professional Bill Warr for 200 guineas at Oakhampton , Berkshire on 18 January 1787 , although the manner of his victory on this occasion was \" scarcely worthy of being called a fight \" , according to The Sportsman 's Magazine . Warr had to resort to shifting and falling to the ground in order to stay in the contest , and as both tactics were regarded as underhand he attracted the ire of the crowd . He survived for almost 90 minutes until a choice blow from Johnson caused Warr to run from the ring , despite the protestations of his second . A hiatus in Johnson 's boxing career followed , with no challengers coming forward until the Irish champion Michael Ryan took an interest . The fight at Wraysbury , then in Buckinghamshire , on either 18 or 19 December 1787 saw Richard Humphries ( \" The Gentleman Boxer \" ) acting as Johnson 's second and Daniel Mendoza as his bottle-holder . Ryan was the favourite to win before the fight , and he had Johnson reeling against the rails of the ring with a blow to the head after almost 20 minutes had elapsed . Humphries ' second stepped in to prevent a second strike and this enraged the crowd because they believed Ryan could continue hitting until Johnson fell to the ground . They encouraged Ryan to declare himself victor as a consequence of this foul but he refused , as he wanted to win by means other than a technicality . He allowed Johnson to recover and then , in the space of the next ten minutes , lost the bout . = = = Financial security = = = The nature of the fight with Ryan led to a much anticipated re-match at Cassiobury Park , Hertfordshire on 11 February 1789 . At stake was prize money of 600 guineas , as well as Johnson 's title of champion . Humphries again acted as Johnson 's second and a man called Jackson was his bottle-holder . The fight consisted of one round of mutually displayed skill , during which Johnson was felled , and thereafter was brutal passion . Egan described it as The set-to was one of the finest ever witnessed and much science was displayed ; the parries and feints eliciting general admiration ... [ The second round ] was terrible beyond description \u2013 science seemed forgotten \u2013 and they appeared like two blacksmiths at an anvil , when Ryan received a knock-down blow . The battle was well sustained on both sides for some time ; but Ryan 's passion getting the better of him , he began to lose ground . Ryan 's head and eyes made a dreadful appearance and Johnson was severely punished . It was over in 33 minutes , when Ryan gave up the fight . One spectator , a Mr Hollingsworth , who was a corn factor and had at one time employed Johnson , was so impressed and pleased with how much he had made from betting on Johnson that he settled a \u00a3 20 per annum gift for life on the fighter . A proposed bout later in the same year against Ben Bryan ( sometimes known as Ben Brian , Ben Brain or Ben Bryant ) came to nothing . Bryan had been a collier in Kingswood , Bristol before moving to London to fight . He was seen as a strong potential challenger , having already won two fights in the provinces and then won against John Boone ( known as \" The Fighting Grenadier \" ) , a man called Corbally , and Tom Tring . The prize money was set at \u00a3 1000 , but Bryan became ill and had to withdraw , forfeiting his staked deposit of \u00a3 100 . Later in 1789 fighters from the Birmingham area issued a series of challenges to opponents based around London , intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters . Three of the challenges were accepted , including that from Isaac Perrins to Tom Johnson . Perrins , who has been described as \" the knock-kneed hammerman from Soho \" , had already issued a general challenge , offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas , having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham . The Perrins \u2013 Johnson fight took place at Banbury on 22 October 1789 , billed as a battle between Birmingham and London as well as for the English Championship . The venue had been intended to be Newmarket during a race meeting but permission could not be obtained . The two men were about the same age but physically very different . Perrins stood 6 ' 2 \" ( 1.88 m ) tall and weighed 238 pounds ( 108 kg ) . It was claimed that he had lifted 896 pounds ( 406 kg ) of iron with ease , and he was \" universally allowed to possess much skill and excellent bottom \" . That is , it was acknowledged that he was skillful and courageous . The physical mismatch was later described as a fight between Hercules , in the form of Perrins , and a boy . The first five minutes of competition saw neither man strike a blow and then when Perrins tried to make contact Johnson dodged and felled Perrins in return . Although Perrins recovered to hold the upper hand in the first few rounds , Johnson then began to dance around the ring , forcing Perrins to follow in order to make a fight of it . This was the first time in his career that Johnson had found it necessary to resort to this tactic of shifting . It confused Perrins because of it being contrary to the custom at the time , but the rules for this particular fight did not prevent it . Nor did they specify what should happen if a contestant fell to the ground , which is what Johnson did in order to avoid being hit \u2013 this action was thought by the spectators to be unsporting but was permitted by the two umpires . Before long both fighters showed signs of their opponent 's attacks , with first Perrins and then Johnson suffering cut eyes and then further damage to their faces . By the fight 's end Perrins ' head \" had scarcely the traces left of a human being \" , according to Egan in his history of boxing . The contest lasted 62 rounds , which took a total of 75 minutes to complete , until Perrins became totally exhausted . Tony Gee has said that Perrins had overwhelming physical advantages but , owing to his na\u00efvety , no clause was inserted in the articles of agreement to prevent \" shifting \" ... Moreover , Perrins was inexperienced in the subterfuges of the sport and found himself outwitted by his artful adversary . Perrins ' supporters had gambled heavily on him because of his reputation and his advantage in size . In the event it was a major supporter of Johnson , a Thomas Bullock , who gained ; he won \u00a3 20,000 ( equivalent to \u00a3 220,000 as of 2010 ) from his bets in favour of Johnson and gifted the victor \u00a3 1,000 . The event was recorded in The Gentleman 's Magazine of that month : ... a great boxing match took place ... between two bruisers , Perrins and Johnson : for which a turf stage had been erected 5 foot 6 inches high , and about 40 feet square . The combatants set-to at one in the afternoon ; and , after sixty-two rounds of fair and hard fighting , victory was declared in favour of Johnson , exactly at fifteen minutes after two . The number of persons of family and fortune , who interested themselves in this brutal conquest , is astonishing : many of whom , it is proper to add , paid dearly for their diversion . The contestants received 250 guineas each , with Johnson also receiving two-thirds of the entrance takings ( after costs ) and Perrins receiving the other third . The net takings were \u00a3 800 , and the number of spectators was variously stated as being 3,000 or 5,000 . Johnson called on Perrins and left him a guinea to buy himself a drink before leaving Banbury . The fight had proved to be \" one of the hardest , cleanest and most brilliant encounters that ever took place \" . As O 'Hara put it , \" The stevedore at 33 has become at 39 the Croesus of the ring . \" Copper medals were struck to commemorate each of the contestants . The obverse side of these contained a picture of the respective fighter ; the reverse had the Latin inscription Bella ! Horrida bella ! ( a quotation from Virgil which can be translated as \" wars , horrible wars \" ) and the words \" Strength and magnanimity \" in the case of Perrins , and \" Science and intrepidity \" for that of Johnson . Chaloner has speculated that these may have been produced by Perrins ' employers , Boulton and Watt , and says that they bear similarities with the work of a French die maker called Ponthon who was supplying the firm with industrial items from at least 1791 . The National Portrait Gallery holds two pictures of the Banbury fight , one an etching published by George Smeeton in 1812 , and the other by Joseph Grozer in 1789 . = = = Last fight = = = Ben Bryan now challenged Johnson once more . He had recovered from his previous illness and won a fight at Banbury against Jacombs , another of the Birmingham challengers , on the day after Johnson 's victory against Perrins . Subsequently Bryan had drawn a 180-round contest with Bill Hooper , also known as \" The Tinman \" , regarding which The Sportsman 's Magazine claimed \" A more ridiculous match never took place in the annals of pugilism . \" The Duke of Hamilton supplied Bryan 's stake to fight Johnson in a contest for a prize of 500 guineas held at Wrotham , Kent . Although it is thought that he held property worth \u00a3 5,000 by the end of the 1780s , and had earned the equivalent of US $ 125,000 in 1789 alone ( including money earned from betting on himself ) , Johnson had to rely on friends to provide his stake because he had spent all of his money . He was a gambling man and an \" easy mark \" , attracting people who gladly took his money from him . Brailsford has commented that this dissipation in his personal life was at odds with his cautious , calculated approach when in the prize ring . Johnson was a clear favourite to win the match , which took place on 17 January 1791 and attracted even more spectators than had been present for the Perrins fight . He had Joe Ward as his second and Mendoza as his bottle holder , with those roles for Bryan being filled by Warr and Humphries . The brutality of the initial fighting was shared by both men . Johnson 's nerve failed him , as did his command of the techniques that had served him well . O 'Hara describes that he fought \" like a wild man \" and , throwing caution to the wind , broke a metacarpal in his middle finger after the momentum created by throwing a wild punch caused him to crash into the ring rail and then to the floor . This was the turning point , and O 'Hara describes the situation as , \" Frightfully beaten , his fists useless , his eyes closed , bathed in blood , and without the chance even of turning the tide with a lucky punch , he refuses to surrender . \" He had to resort to shifting once more and eventually to wrestling with the hair of Bryan , which generated much disapprobation among the crowd . Eventually Bryan forced Johnson to the floor and beat him unconscious . Johnson had lost the fight , and his status as champion , in 21 minutes . Egan speculated that Johnson 's change in style , evident from the outset of the fight might have been due to either genuine concern about Bryan 's abilities or from his gambling problems ; either way , \" there was a miserable falling off in him altogether ! \" Egan wrote that Johnson was the nearest any boxer had come to matching the skill of Jack Broughton . He was thought to have earned more money during his reign as champion than any other fighter until John L. Sullivan almost a century later . Jack Anderson , a modern historian of the sport , has summarised the early boxing writers as agreeing the period of Johnson 's reign as champion \" rescued the declining sport and heralded the beginning of a golden age \" . = = Life after boxing = = Johnson acted as second to various fighters around the period of his rise and fall . He performed this duty for Tom Tyne ( \" The Tailor \" ) at Croydon on 1 July 1788 and at Horton Moor on 24 March 1790 , having previously done so for a fighter called Savage who had taken on Jack Doyle at Stepney Fields on 22 November 1787 . He also acted twice for Humphries , in his fights against Mendoza at Odiham on 9 January 1788 , when Mendoza sprained his ankle on the slippery surface , and at Stilton on 9 May 1789 . There was much controversy at the latter , with O 'Hara reporting that this caused Mendoza 's second , a Captain Brown , to call Johnson a blackguard ; Johnson responded by threatening \" to punch Brown into Eternity . \" Johnson switched fighters and seconded Mendoza against Humphries at Doncaster on 29 September 1790 , and again in a contest against Warr near Croydon in May 1792 . Similarly , he acted as second for Hooper when he fought George Maddox at Sydenham Common on 10 February 1794 and for Tom \" Paddington \" Jones at Blackheath on 10 May 1794 . Other occasions when he acted as second include for John Jackson ( near to Croydon , 9 June 1788 ; and against Mendoza at Hornchurch on 15 April 1795 ) , and Joe Ward ( at Hyde Park , date unknown ) . After his defeat by Bryan he bought and ran a public house , The Grapes , in Duke Street , Lincoln 's Inn Fields , London . Retired prizefighters at that time often received the proceeds of a financial collection from their supporters to enable them to buy a licence to operate such premises : \" today 's fighter was merely tomorrow 's publican in waiting \" . In a 1901 review of sporting prints titled The old and new pugilism , which lamented the passing of the style and the discipline of prize-fighting , \" the goal of the successful pugilist was a sporting public house ... they were generally in side or back streets , where the house did not command a transient trade . Most of these sporting \" pubs \" had a large room at the back or upstairs , which was open one night a week ( preferably Saturday ) , for public sparring , which was always conducted by a pugilist of some note . \" The Grapes soon became known as a haunt of gamblers and criminals , which probably lost Johnson his licence to operate the premises . Subsequently he sought wagers at horse race meetings and cockpits , refusing to pay if he lost and instead challenging the victor to a fight . Johnson moved to Copper Alley , Dublin , but had to leave after magistrates determined that his premises were \" not proving so consonant to the principles of propriety , as was wished \" . He then went to Cork , where he tried to earn a living by teaching boxing . Finding that unrewarding he turned once again to gambling , and according to Dennis Brailsford \" His deterioration was rapid . Both his health and his spirit were broken \" . He died in Cork on 21 January 1797 , aged 47 . Johnson tutored George Ingleston ( The Brewer ) and was at least a supporter of Jones , on whom he once bet \u00a3 100 to win a fight . He also taught a man called Simpson , who went on to fight Jones in 1804 . Johnson 's brother , Bill Jackling , also did some boxing . He lost to Elias Spray some time prior to Spray 's 1805 fight against Joseph Bourkes , a perennial challenger for the championship .",

Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army was split into the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Following the outbreak of war , on 14 September 1939 Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force ( Second AIF ) , would be formed for overseas service . Meanwhile , conscription was introduced in October 1939 to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . The Australian Army subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 . Following the Japanese surrender Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces across the South West Pacific . Meanwhile , the Army contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan from 1946 . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions and three armoured divisions , and in August 1942 the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force was larger than Australia 's population and economy could sustain , and its strength was reduced in the second half of the year . Militia units were able to serve outside of Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 after the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed , but few did so . The Army was further reduced by 100,000 members from October 1943 to free up manpower for industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment and the Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1943 . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South West Pacific . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 . These units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 with fewer heavy weapons and vehicles . This organisation proved only moderately successful , and the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns . The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities in August 1945 and was finally completed on 15 February 1947 . A total of 730,000 personnel enlisted in the Australian Army during the war , a figure which represented around 10 percent of the population . Nearly 400,000 men ultimately served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . As a proportion of its population , the Australian Army was ultimately one of the largest Allied armies during World War II . Casualties included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 who died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . Another 5,558 were killed or died as prisoners of war ( POWs ) , while non-battle casualties in operational areas were also significant and included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded or injured . In addition , the Army suffered a substantial number of casualties in non-operational areas : 1,795 soldiers killed and 121,800 wounded or injured . = = Background = = Prior to the outbreak of war the Australian Army consisted of the small full-time Permanent Military Forces ( PMF ) and the larger part-time Militia . Throughout the inter-war years , a combination of complacency and economic austerity had resulted in limited defence spending . In 1929 , following the election of the Scullin Labor government , conscription was abolished and in its place a new system was introduced whereby the Militia would be maintained on a part-time , voluntary basis only . The size of the Army remained small up until 1938 and 1939 when the Militia was rapidly expanded as the threat of war grew . In 1938 , there had been only 35,000 soldiers in the Militia , but by September 1939 this had been increased to 80,000 , supported by a PMF of 2,800 full-time soldiers whose main responsibility was largely to administer and train the Militia . This expansion had little impact on improving the readiness of Australian forces upon the outbreak of the war , though , as the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 restricted the pre-war Army to service in Australia and its territories including Papua and New Guinea . As a result , when Australia entered the war in 1939 , a new all-volunteer force was required that could fight in Europe or elsewhere outside of Australia 's immediate region . ( Similarly , in World War I the all-volunteer First Australian Imperial Force ( First AIF ) was raised and served with distinction at Gallipoli , in the Middle East and on the Western Front . ) From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by the \" Singapore strategy \" , which centred on the establishment of a major naval base at Singapore and the use of naval forces to respond to any future Japanese aggression in the region . As a maritime strategy , it resulted in a defence budget that was focused on building up the Royal Australian Navy ( RAN ) , in order to support the British Royal Navy . Between 1923 and 1929 , \u00a3 20,000,000 was spent on the RAN , while the Australian Army and the munitions industry received only \u00a3 10,000,000 and the fledgling Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) just \u00a3 2,400,000 . The strategy met significant political opposition from sections of the regular Army , including several prominent officers such as Henry Wynter and John Lavarack . Wynter in particular argued that war was most likely to break out in the Pacific at a time when Britain was involved in a crisis in Europe and would be unable to send sufficient resources to Singapore . He contended that Singapore was vulnerable , especially to attack from the land and the air , and argued for a more balanced policy of building up the Army and RAAF rather than relying on the RAN . During the 1930s the Australian Army 's organisation , equipment and doctrine were similar to those of World War I. The Militia was organised into infantry and horse-mounted cavalry divisions with fixed coastal fortifications positioned at strategic ports . While the Army recognised that there was a threat of war with Japan , little had been done to prepare for jungle warfare as pre-war planning had conceptualised any such conflict as taking place in the main population centres of Australia 's eastern seaboard , along with isolated attacks against strategic points in Western Australia . The Army followed the trends in the British Army as it modernised in the late 1930s , but was unable to obtain the up-to-date equipment needed to properly implement the new British doctrines and organisations due to a lack of resources as a result of limited defence expenditures . Nevertheless , the Militia provided a pool of experienced officers and soldiers who could be used to expand the Army in the event of war , and indeed during the course of the war about 200,000 Militia soldiers volunteered for overseas service . In 1942 the Army adopted the title Australian Military Forces ( AMF ) to encompass the various categories of service : AIF , Militia and Permanent Forces . Wartime exigencies required a rapid expansion of the Army and during the war 730,000 personnel enlisted in either the Militia or the AIF , a figure which represented around 10 percent of Australia 's population of just seven million , one of the highest percentages of any of the Allied armies during World War II . It subsequently made an important contribution to the Allied campaigns in the Mediterranean , the Middle East and North Africa fighting the Germans , Italians and Vichy French during 1940 and 1941 as part of British Commonwealth forces , and later in the jungles of the South West Pacific Area ( SWPA ) fighting the Japanese between late 1941 and 1945 primarily in conjunction with forces from the United States . Nearly 400,000 men served overseas , with 40 percent of the total force serving in front line areas . = = Organisation = = = = = Origin of the Second Australian Imperial Force = = = Australia entered World War II on 3 September 1939 . On 14 September Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced that 40,000 members of the Militia would be called up for training and a 20,000-strong expeditionary force , designated the Second Australian Imperial Force , would be formed for overseas service . Like its predecessor , the Second AIF was a volunteer force formed by establishing entirely new units . In many cases these units drew their recruits from the same geographical areas as First AIF units , and they were given the same numerical designations albeit with the prefix \" 2 / \" . In October 1939 , conscription was introduced to keep the Militia at strength as its members volunteered for the AIF . From January 1940 , all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service . While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military , the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service . A side effect of this arrangement was the creation of two different armies with different conditions of service , one the part-volunteer part-conscript Militia and the other the all-volunteer AIF . This situation resulted in administrative and structural problems that existed throughout the war , as well as a sometimes bitter professional rivalry between the men of the two forces . Later , provision was made to allow Militia units to transfer to the AIF if sufficient numbers of personnel volunteered to serve under AIF terms of service . This required 65 percent of a unit 's war establishment \u2014 or 75 percent of its actual strength \u2014 to volunteer and allowed whole battalions to become part of the AIF . An early problem was whether to adopt the British or Australian organisation . In 1939 the British Army was in the process of re-equipping with new weapons , and a new organisation was required . This new equipment was not available in Australia , so it was decided to organise the first unit to be raised \u2014 the 6th Division \u2014 with some elements of the old organisation and some of the new . Consequently , the 6th Division was raised as an infantry division of around 18,000 personnel , and initially comprised twelve 900-man infantry battalions each consisting of four rifle companies , a battalion headquarters , regimental aid post and a headquarters company with various support platoons and sections including signals , mortars , carriers , pioneers , anti-aircraft and administration . Artillery support was provided by three field regiments , each attached at brigade-level , as well an anti-tank regiment attached at divisional level and a divisional cavalry regiment which was equipped with armoured vehicles . Corps troops included a machine-gun battalion , and various engineer , logistics and communication units . Three further AIF infantry divisions were formed during 1940 : the 7th Division in February 1940 , the 8th Division in May and the 9th Division in June . However , the establishment of these divisions was reduced to the new nine-battalion organisation as the size of an Australian division was reduced to approximately 17,000 men , and the three surplus battalions of the 6th Division became part of the 7th Division . Further changes included the addition of a light anti-aircraft regiment at divisional level , and a reorganisation of the divisional artillery from three four-battery regiments consisting of 16 guns to three two-battery regiments of 12 guns . An AIF corps headquarters , designated I Corps , was formed in March 1940 along with various support units . The 1st Armoured Division , the final AIF division to be formed , was established in July 1941 , built around a core of two armoured brigades each consisting of three tank-equipped armoured regiments , supported by motorised cavalry , armoured cars , engineers and artillery . Several units , such as Z and M Special Units , were also raised for irregular warfare as were 12 commando companies . Many corps , support and service units were also raised during the war to provide combat and logistical support . = = = Forces in Australia and the Pacific = = = The Army 's command and administrative arrangements at the start of the war were based on a system of military districts that had existed since Federation , albeit with a number of modifications . Australia was divided into six military districts each of which largely equated to a State or Territory , and reported to the Department of the Chief of the General Staff . Meanwhile , the Military Board was responsible for the administration of the Army , with regular members consisting of the Deputy Adjutant-General , the Chief of Intelligence , the Chief of the General Staff , the Chief of Ordnance and a civilian Finance Member , in addition to a number of consultative members , under the overall control of the Minister of the Defence . The 1st Military District ( 1 MD ) encompassed Queensland , the 2nd included most of New South Wales , the 3rd was primarily based on Victoria , the 4th included South Australia , the 5th included Western Australia and the 6th encompassed forces in Tasmania . In 1939 the Northern Territory was designated the 7th Military District , while and the 8th Military District was later activated in Port Moresby to command forces in New Guinea . Following the outbreak of World War II a regional command structure was subsequently adopted , with 2 MD becoming Eastern Command , 5 MD redesignated Western Command , while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales , Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command . In the early years of the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas ; however , as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure . The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan 's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation . In response , the Army command structure was reorganised in early 1942 . While Western Australia remained unchanged , Queensland , New South Wales , Victoria , Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas , 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force . In July 1942 the Military Board 's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces , General Sir Thomas Blamey . The AIF 's requirements for manpower and equipment constrained the Militia during the early years of the war . At the outbreak of the Pacific War the main Army units in Australia were five Militia infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th Divisions \u2014 two Militia cavalry divisions \u2014 the 1st and 2nd Cavalry Divisions \u2014 and the AIF 1st Armoured Division . The Volunteer Defence Corps ( VDC ) , which was a part-time volunteer force of 100,000 men based on the British Home Guard , was also available for local defence . In addition , by early 1942 there were 12,000 garrison force personnel \u2014 mostly reservist veterans of World War I \u2014 organised into 13 garrison battalions for coastal defence and five battalions and two companies for internal security tasks , including guarding prisoner of war camps . Yet at this time only 30 percent of Militia units were on full-time duty , with the remainder periodically undertaking three month-long mobilisations . The Militia was also poorly armed , and there was insufficient equipment to be issued to all units if they were mobilised . In response to the Japanese threat following the outbreak of the Pacific War and the capture of the 8th Division in Malaya , the condition of the Militia became a pressing concern , after largely having been ignored since 1940 . Several middle-ranking and senior officers of the AIF were subsequently posted to Militia units and formations to give them experience . Meanwhile , the Army was forced to move units between Militia divisions so that the most combat-ready could be sent to areas believed to be under the greatest threat of attack . Some battalions were amalgamated , and although some were later separated and reformed , others were disbanded altogether . After the Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 was passed Militia units were able to serve outside Australian territory in the South West Pacific Area from January 1943 , though the 11th Brigade was the only major formation to do so . The Army was considerably expanded in early 1942 in response to the Japanese threat to Australia . During this year the Army 's strength peaked at eleven infantry divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 7th , 9th , 10th , 11th and 12th Divisions \u2014 and three armoured divisions \u2014 the 1st , 2nd and 3rd \u2014 organised into the First and Second Armies , and I , II and III Corps , as well as many support and service units . In August 1942 , the Army had a strength of 476,000 men . This force proved larger than what Australia 's population and industry could sustain ; by late 1942 the number of personnel who needed to be inducted each month to make good losses caused by sickness and combat was much larger than the numbers who were becoming eligible for service , and the allocation of a high proportion of Australia 's limited supply of manpower to the military was inhibiting the expansion of the munitions industry and other key sectors of the economy . The Army was also unbalanced as a large majority its personnel were employed in arms corps undertaking combat and combat support roles . Heavily reliant upon its allies for logistical support , it required more personnel in support arms such as ordnance and transport to be functional as a self-sufficient organisation . This situation was most acute in 1942 ; at that time there were 137,236 men serving arms corps such as infantry , cavalry and armour , while there were just 29,079 in ordnance . This imbalance was slowly addressed after 1942 as the Army 's size was reduced . Most of the units that were disbanded were Militia arms corps units , and by September 1943 the AIF outnumbered the Militia , having 265,000 members compared to just over 117,000 . Further reductions came in October 1943 when the Army 's strength was further reduced by 100,000 men to free up manpower to work in industry . At the end of 1943 the Army 's strength was set at six infantry divisions and two armoured brigades , although further reductions were ordered in August 1944 and June 1945 . By 1945 the support arms had grown considerably as a proportion of the total force and by August 1945 ordnance and the electrical and mechanical engineers totalled 42,835 men , while the artillery had been reduced to half its previous strength . Infantry , cavalry and armoured corps personnel numbered just 62,097 men , while engineers , signals and the medical services remained the same , albeit as part of a much smaller Army . Regardless , at the end of the war it remained one of the largest Allied armies as a proportion of population , being second only to the Soviet Union . The VDC was also reduced in size in May 1944 , and was finally disbanded on 24 August 1945 . If the conflict had continued past August 1945 , the size of the Army would have been further reduced to three divisions once Bougainville , New Guinea and New Britain had been secured . Two of these divisions would have been used on garrison duties , while a brigade group may have been made available for British-led operations in South East Asia and the remaining division was to take part in the invasion of Japan . The demands of combat during World War II led to changes in the composition of Army units . The success of German mechanised units during the invasions of Poland and France convinced Australian defence planners that the Army required armoured units , and these began to be raised in 1941 when the 1st Armoured Division was formed . The two Militia cavalry divisions were first motorised and then converted into armoured divisions in 1942 and the 3rd Army Tank Brigade was formed to provide support to the infantry . These large armoured units were not suitable for jungle warfare , however , and most were disbanded during 1943 and 1944 . Conditions in the South West Pacific also led the Army to convert its six combat divisions to jungle divisions in early 1943 and 1944 , reducing the authorised strength of the division by about 4,000 men . Each infantry battalion shed around 100 personnel as various support elements such as the anti-aircraft and carrier platoons were removed and consolidated at divisional level . The amount of heavy weapons and vehicles was also reduced , but the conditions that the organisation was designed for did not recur and it proved only moderately successful . As a result , the divisions were strengthened for their 1944 \u2013 45 campaigns by returning the artillery and anti-tank units that had been removed . The creation of the jungle divisions represented the first time in the Australian Army 's history that it had adopted an organisation specifically for the conditions in which its forces would fight . Previously force structure had been heavily influenced by the British Army , and the decision to adopt an organisation to suit local conditions reflected a growing maturity and independence . Yet it also resulted in the adoption of a two-tier force structure , as formations that were not designated for jungle warfare remained on the previous scales of equipment and manning . Ultimately , while their structure was better suited to operations in Australia , they were no longer able to be used against the Japanese . As a result , the burden of the fighting increasingly fell on those formations that had been re-organised , while the remainder of the Army was relegated to garrison duties . The Army also raised many anti-aircraft and coastal defence units during the war . The pre-war coastal defences were greatly expanded from 1939 , and many new batteries were built near major ports in Australia and New Guinea in response to the threat of Japanese attack . Australia had a limited capacity to produce anti-aircraft guns , and the bulk of equipment had to come from Britain . As such the development of such defences was initially hampered by a lack of available equipment . The coastal defence system reached its peak size during 1944 . The Army had few anti-aircraft guns at the outbreak of war , and a high priority was given to expanding the air defences around major cities and important industrial and military facilities . By 1942 anti-aircraft batteries were in place around all the major cities as well as the key towns in northern Australia . The expansion of the artillery in general , and coastal defence and anti-aircraft units in particular , meant that by June 1942 some 80,000 of the 406,000 members of the Army were artillerymen . VDC units gradually took over responsibility for manning the fixed coastal and anti-aircraft defences as the threat of attack against the Australian mainland receded . Traditionally the Australian Army had relied on its major allies to provide logistic support , primarily raising combat units rather than support arms during times of conflict . Consequently , these services were relatively underdeveloped , and they remained so during the first years of the war . While British units provided many logistic and line of communication services for the AIF in North Africa during the early campaigns in 1940 and 1941 , the Army needed to raise extensive support units to support its combat formations in the Pacific following the Japanese entry into the war . As a result , the growth of the support arms and ancillary services proved dramatic , including many capabilities which the Australian Army had only minimal or no previous experience in maintaining . These units included terminal formations and beach groups responsible for loading and unloading ships , food and petroleum storage and distribution units and several farm units which grew food for troops in remote areas . In addition , with Australia 's national support base located well to the rear , in the major cities in the south-east of the country , significant expansion of the Army 's transport capabilities was required to move supplies and men to the field force based in northern Australia and New Guinea . Many road transport units were raised to move supplies around Australia , while the Royal Australian Engineers eventually operated a fleet of 1,900 watercraft and three air maintenance companies were formed to load supply aircraft . = = = Women 's services = = = Prior to World War II the Australian Army Nursing Service ( AANS ) was the only female branch of the Army . A reserve formation that had served overseas during World War I , the AANS was mobilised following the outbreak of war in 1939 and its Matron in Chief , Grace Wilson , served on the staff of the Director-General of Medical Services , Major General Rupert Downes . For most of the war , AANS nurses were the only Australian servicewomen permitted to serve overseas , and many volunteered for the AIF . These women served in all the major theatres in which the Army fought and a total of 71 were killed on active service . The majority of these died in early 1942 during the fighting in Malaya and Singapore where 41 nurses were killed . In March 1942 , the Volunteer Aid Detachments ( VADs ) also became a branch of the Army Medical Service . Consisting of volunteers originally coordinated by the Australian Red Cross and Order of Saint John , the VADs were redesignated the Australian Army Medical Women 's Service ( AAMWS ) in December 1942 , and were employed in military hospitals in Australia and overseas until after the end of the war , before returning to civilian control in 1948 . Shortages of manpower also led to the establishment of the Australian Women 's Army Service ( AWAS ) in August 1941 . AWAS members filled a wide range of roles to allow the Army to redeploy male soldiers to fighting units . While they mainly worked in clerical and administrative positions , and auxiliary roles such as drivers and signallers , many served in anti-aircraft batteries , operating radars and searchlights but not the guns themselves . While Blamey sought to have members of the AWAS posted overseas from early 1941 onwards , the Australian Government did not agree to this until 1945 . As a result , only about 400 of the 24,000 women who joined the AWAS served outside Australia . The AWAS was reduced in size following the war , and was finally disbanded on 30 June 1947 . Colonel Sybil Irving commanded the AWAS from September 1941 until 1947 . In total some 35,000 women served in the Army , making up about 5 percent of the force . = = Campaigns = = = = = North Africa = = = During the first years of World War II , Australia 's military strategy was closely aligned with that of the United Kingdom 's imperial defence policy . The Singapore strategy , which seemingly negated the need for large-scale land forces in the Pacific , was a key component of this policy and consequently most Australian military units that were deployed overseas in 1940 and 1941 were sent to the Mediterranean and Middle East where they formed an integral part of the Commonwealth forces in the area . The three AIF infantry divisions dispatched to the Middle East were subsequently heavily involved in the fighting that followed . In addition to the force which was sent to North Africa , two AIF brigades ( the 18th and 25th ) were stationed in Britain from June 1940 to January 1941 and formed part of the British mobile reserve which would have responded to any German landings . An Australian Army forestry group also served in Britain between 1940 and 1943 . The Australian Army first saw action in Operation Compass , the successful Commonwealth offensive in North Africa which was conducted between December 1940 and February 1941 . Although the 6th Division was not fully equipped , it had completed its training and on 14 December , it relieved the 4th Indian Division . Given the task of capturing Italian fortresses bypassed by the British 7th Armoured Division during its advance , on 3 January , the division went into action at Bardia . Although the fortress was manned by a larger force , the Australian infantry quickly penetrated the Italian defensive lines with the support of British tanks and artillery . The majority of the defenders surrendered on 5 January and the Australians took 40,000 prisoners . The 6th Division followed up this success by assaulting the fortress of Tobruk on 21 January , securing it the next day and taking 25,000 Italians prisoner . After this , the Australians pushed west along the coast road to Cyrenaica and captured Benghazi on 4 February . Later that month , the 6th Division was withdrawn for deployment to Greece and was replaced by the untested 9th Division , which took up garrison duties in Cyrenaica . In the last week of March 1941 , a German-led force launched an offensive in Cyrenaica . The Allied forces in the area were rapidly forced to withdraw towards Egypt . The 9th Division formed the rear guard of this withdrawal , and on 6 April was ordered to defend the important port town of Tobruk for at least two months . Sustained by the Australian destroyers of the Mediterranean Fleet , during the ensuing siege the 9th Division , reinforced by the 7th Division 's 18th Brigade as well as British artillery and armoured regiments , used fortifications , aggressive patrolling and artillery to contain and defeat repeated German armoured and infantry attacks . In September and October 1941 , upon the request of the Australian Government , the 9th Division was relieved and the bulk withdrawn from Tobruk . The 2 / 13th Battalion , however , was forced to remain until the siege was lifted in December as the convoy evacuating it was attacked . The defence of Tobruk cost the Australian units involved 3,009 casualties , including 832 killed and 941 taken prisoner . = = = Greece , Crete and Lebanon = = = In early 1941 the 6th Division and I Corps headquarters took part in the ill-fated Allied expedition to defend Greece from a German invasion . The corps ' commander , Lieutenant General Thomas Blamey , and Prime Minister Menzies both regarded the operation as risky , but agreed to Australian involvement after the British Government provided them with briefings which deliberately understated the chance of defeat . The Allied force deployed to Greece was much smaller than the German force in the region and the defence of the country was compromised by inconsistencies between Greek and Allied plans . Australian troops arrived in Greece during March and manned defensive positions in the north of the country alongside British , New Zealand and Greek units . The outnumbered Allied force was not able to halt the Germans when they invaded on 6 April and was forced to retreat . The Australians and other Allied units conducted a fighting withdrawal from their initial positions and were evacuated from southern Greece between 24 April and 1 May . Australian warships also formed part of the force which protected the evacuation and embarked hundreds of soldiers from Greek ports . The 6th Division suffered heavy casualties in this campaign , with 320 men killed and 2,030 captured . While most of the 6th Division returned to Egypt , the 19th Brigade Group and two provisional infantry battalions landed at Crete where they formed a key part of the island 's defences . The 19th Brigade was initially successful in holding its positions when German paratroopers landed on 20 May , but was gradually forced to retreat . After several key airfields were lost the Allies evacuated the island 's garrison . Approximately 3,000 Australians , including the entire 2 / 7th Battalion , could not be evacuated , and were taken prisoner . As a result of its heavy casualties the 6th Division required substantial reinforcements and equipment before it was again ready for combat . The 7th Division , reinforced by the 6th Division 's 17th Brigade , formed a key part of the Allied ground forces during the Syria \u2013 Lebanon campaign which was fought against Vichy French forces in June and July 1941 . With close air support from the RAAF and the Royal Air Force , the Australian force entered Lebanon on 8 June and advanced along the coast road and Litani River valley . Although little resistance had been expected , the Vichy forces mounted a strong defence which made good use of the mountainous terrain . After the Allied attack became bogged down reinforcements were brought in and the Australian I Corps headquarters took command of the operation on 18 June . These changes enabled the Allies to overwhelm the French forces and the 7th Division entered Beirut on 12 July . The loss of Beirut and a British breakthrough in Syria led the Vichy commander to seek an armistice and the campaign ended on 13 July . = = = El Alamein = = = In the second half of 1941 the Australian I Corps was concentrated in Syria and Lebanon where it undertook garrison duties while its strength was rebuilt ahead of further operations in the Middle East . Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific most elements of the corps , including the 6th and 7th Divisions , returned to Australia in early 1942 to counter the perceived Japanese threat to Australia . The Australian Government agreed to requests from Britain and the United States to temporarily retain the 9th Division in the Middle East in exchange for the deployment of additional US troops to Australia and Britain 's support for a proposal to expand the RAAF to 73 squadrons . The Government did not intend that the 9th Division would play a major role in active fighting , and it was not sent any further reinforcements . In mid-1942 , the Axis forces defeated the Commonwealth force in Libya and advanced into north-west Egypt . In June the British Eighth Army made a stand just over 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) west of Alexandria , at the railway siding of El Alamein and the 9th Division was brought forward to reinforce this position . The lead elements of the division arrived at El Alamein on 6 July and it was assigned the most northerly section of the Commonwealth defensive line . From that position , the 9th Division subsequently played a significant role in the First Battle of El Alamein , helping to halt the Axis advance . Casualties were heavy , and the 2 / 28th Battalion was forced to surrender on 27 July when it was surrounded by German armour after capturing Ruin Ridge . Following this battle the division remained at the northern end of the El Alamein line and launched diversionary attacks during the Battle of Alam el Halfa in early September . In October 1942 , the 9th Division and the RAAF squadrons in the area took part in the Second Battle of El Alamein . After a lengthy period of preparation , the Eighth Army launched its major offensive on 23 October . The 9th Division was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle , and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2nd New Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1 / 2 November . The 9th Division suffered a high number of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces . During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as it was not possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain it , and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November . The 9th Division left Egypt for Australia in January 1943 , ending the AIF 's involvement in the war in North Africa . = = = Malaya and Singapore = = = Due to the emphasis placed on cooperation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units were stationed in Australia and the Asia-Pacific region after 1940 . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan loomed in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . The 8th Division was subsequently dispatched to Singapore in February 1941 , while plans were made for a Militia battalion to be stationed between Port Moresby and Thursday Island . An AIF battalion was also allocated to garrison Rabaul , and another brigade would be dispersed piecemeal to Timor and Ambon . Meanwhile , in July 1941 the 1st Independent Company was deployed to Kavieng on New Britain in order to protect the airfield , while sections were sent to Namatanai in central New Ireland , Vila in the New Hebrides , Tulagi on Guadalcanal , Buka Passage in Bougainville , and Lorengau on Manus Island to act as observers . In December 1941 the Australian Army in the Pacific consisted of the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia , including the 1st Armoured Division . In keeping with the Singapore strategy , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . At the outbreak of war the Australian forces in Malaya consisted of two brigade groups from the 8th Division \u2014 the 22nd and 27th Brigades \u2014 under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett , along with four RAAF squadrons and eight warships . Following the Japanese invasion on 8 December 1941 , the 8th Division and its attached Indian Army units was assigned responsibility for the defence of Johore in the south of Malaya . As a result , it did not see action until mid-January 1942 when Japanese spearheads first reached the state , having pushed back the British and Indian units defending the northern parts of the peninsula . By this time , the division 's two brigades had been split up , with the 22nd having been deployed around Mersing and Endau on the east coast and the 27th in the west . The division 's first engagement came on the west coast around Muar on 14 January , where the Japanese Twenty-Fifth Army was able to outflank the Commonwealth positions due to Bennett misdeploying the forces under his command so that the weak Indian 45th Brigade was assigned the crucial coastal sector and the stronger Australian brigades were deployed in less threatened areas . While the Commonwealth forces in Johore achieved a number of local tactical victories , most notably around Gemas , Bakri and Jemaluang , they were unable to do more than slow the Japanese advance and suffered heavy casualties in doing so . After being outmanoeuvred by the Japanese , the remaining Commonwealth units withdrew to Singapore on the night of 30 \u2013 31 January . Following this the 8th Division was deployed to defend Singapore 's north-west coast . Due to the casualties suffered in Johore most of the division 's units were at half-strength , and the replacements that had been received \u2014 a draft of about 1,900 replacements was sent in late January \u2014 were barely trained , some having as little as two weeks ' training in Australia before being dispatched . Assigned larger-than-normal frontages to defend along beaches that were ill-suited for defence , the 22nd and 27th Brigades were spread thin on the ground with large gaps in their lines . The commander of the Singapore fortress , Lieutenant General Arthur Ernest Percival , believed that the Japanese would land on the north-east coast of the island and deployed the near full-strength British 18th Division to defend this sector . Nevertheless , on 8 February the Japanese landed in the Australian sector , and the 8th Division was forced from its positions after just two days of heavy fighting . A subsequent landing took place at Kranji , but the division was unable to turn this back and subsequently withdrew to the centre of the island . After further fighting in which the Commonwealth forces were pushed into a narrow perimeter around the urban area of Singapore , Percival surrendered his forces on 15 February . Although some Australians were able to escape , following the capitulation 14,972 Australians were taken prisoner . Bennett was among those that managed to get out , having left the island the night before the surrender via sampan after handing over command of his division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan . He later justified his actions saying that he had gained an understanding of how to defeat the Japanese and needed to return to Australia to pass his knowledge on , but two post-war inquiries found that he was unjustified in leaving his command . The loss of almost a quarter of Australia 's overseas soldiers and the failure of the Singapore strategy that had permitted it to accept the sending of the AIF to aid Britain , stunned the country . The fall of Singapore raised fears of a Japanese invasion of the Australian mainland and the Government became concerned about the Army 's ability to respond . Although large , the forces in Australia contained many inexperienced units and lacked mobility . In response , most of the AIF was brought back from the Middle East and the Australian Prime Minister , John Curtin , appealed to the United States for assistance . As Japanese forces advanced through Burma towards India in early 1942 , the British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill , attempted to divert the 6th and 7th Divisions while they were en route to Australia , but Curtin refused to authorise this movement . As a compromise the 16th and 17th Brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at Ceylon and formed part of the island 's garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942 . = = = Netherlands East Indies and Rabaul = = = While Australia 's contribution to the pre-war plans to defend South East Asia from Japanese aggression was focused on the defence of Malaya and Singapore , small Australian forces were also deployed to defend several islands to the north of Australia . The role of these forces was to defend strategic airfields which could be used to launch attacks on the Australian mainland . Detachments of coastwatchers were also stationed in the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands to report on any Japanese operations there . At the start of the Pacific War the strategic port town of Rabaul in New Britain was defended by \" Lark Force \" , which comprised the 2 / 22nd Battalion reinforced with coastal artillery and a poorly equipped RAAF bomber squadron . While Lark Force was regarded as inadequate by the Australian military , it was not possible to reinforce it before the Japanese South Seas Force landed at Rabaul on 23 January 1942 . The outnumbered Australian force was swiftly defeated and most of the survivors surrendered in the weeks after the battle . Few members of Lark Force survived the war , as at least 130 were murdered by the Japanese on 4 February and 1,057 Australian soldiers and civilian prisoners from Rabaul were killed when the ship carrying them to Japan , the transport Montevideo Maru , was sunk by a US submarine on 1 July 1942 . AIF troops were also dispatched from Darwin to the Netherlands East Indies ( NEI ) in the first weeks of the Pacific War . Reinforced battalions from the 8th Division 's third brigade , the 23rd , were sent to Koepang in West Timor as part of \" Sparrow Force \" and to the island of Ambon as \" Gull Force \" to defend these strategic locations from Japanese attack . The 2 / 2nd Independent Company was also sent to Dili in Portuguese Timor in violation of Portugal 's neutrality . The force at Ambon was defeated by the Japanese landing on 30 January and surrendered on 3 February 1942 . Over 300 Australian prisoners were subsequently killed by Japanese troops in a series of mass executions during February . While the force at Koepang was defeated after the Japanese landed there on 20 February and also surrendered , Australian commandos waged a guerrilla campaign against the Japanese in Portuguese Timor until February 1943 . In the lead-up to the Japanese invasion of Java a force of 242 carrier- and land-based aircraft attacked Darwin on 19 February 1942 . At the time Darwin was an important base for Allied warships and a staging point for shipping supplies and reinforcements into the NEI . The Japanese attack was successful , and resulted in the deaths of 251 civilians and military personnel , most of whom were non-Australian Allied seamen , and heavy damage to RAAF Base Darwin and the town 's port facilities . A 3,000-strong Army unit , as well as several Australian warships and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March 1942 . An Army force made up of elements from the 7th Division also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command ( ABDACOM ) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12 March after the Dutch forces on the island began to capitulate . Following the conquest of the NEI , the Japanese Navy 's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean , attacking Ceylon in early April . The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon at the time of the raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate . = = = Defence of Australia = = = Japan 's rapid advance south had been unexpected , and the perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military . By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions , three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units . Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps , which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively . However , Australia 's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed , and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 . Despite Australian fears , the Japanese never intended to invade the Australian mainland . While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942 , it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military 's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken . Instead , in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa and New Caledonia . Yet this plan was frustrated by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway . While these battles ended the threat to Australia , the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943 . A series of Japanese air raids against northern Australia occurred during 1942 and 1943 , and while the main defence was provided by RAAF and Allied fighters , a number of Australian Army anti-aircraft batteries were also involved in dealing with this threat . Meanwhile , in 1942 the Australian military was reinforced by units recalled from the Middle East and an expansion of the Militia and RAAF . United States military units also arrived in Australia in great numbers before being deployed to New Guinea , and in April 1942 command of Australian and US forces in the South West Pacific was consolidated under an American commander , General Douglas MacArthur . After halting the Japanese the Allies moved onto the offensive in late 1942 , with the pace of advance accelerating in 1943 . From 1944 the Australian military was mainly relegated to subsidiary roles in holding or mopping-up operations , but continued to conduct large-scale operations until the end of the war with a larger proportion of its forces deployed in the final months of the conflict than at any other time . = = = Papuan campaign = = = Japanese forces first landed on the mainland of New Guinea on 8 March 1942 when they invaded Lae and Salamaua to secure bases for the defence of the important base they were developing at Rabaul . In response , Australian guerrillas from the New Guinea Volunteer Rifles established observation posts around the Japanese beachheads and the 2 / 5th Independent Company successfully raided Salamaua on 29 June . After the Battle of the Coral Sea frustrated the Japanese plan to capture Port Moresby via an amphibious landing , they attempted to capture the town by landing Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii 's South Seas Force at Buna on the north coast of Papua and advancing overland using the Kokoda Track to cross the rugged Owen Stanley Range . The Kokoda Track campaign began on 22 July when the Japanese began their advance , opposed by an ill-prepared Militia brigade designated \" Maroubra Force \" . This force was successful in delaying the South Seas Force but was unable to halt it . In late August and early September 1942 Australian forces at Milne Bay inflicted the first notable land defeat of the war upon the Japanese . After the Japanese landed a unit of Special Naval Landing Forces to capture the airbases that the Allies had established in the area , two brigades of Australian troops \u2014 the Militia 7th and AIF 18th \u2014 designated \" Milne Force \" , supported by two RAAF fighter squadrons and US Army engineers , launched a counter-attack . Outnumbered , lacking supplies and suffering heavy casualties , the Japanese were forced to withdraw . The victory helped raise Allied morale across the Pacific Theatre , especially on the Kokoda Track where the Japanese had continued to make progress throughout August . On 26 August two AIF battalions from the 7th Division reinforced the remnants of Maroubra Force but the Japanese continued to advance along the Kokoda Track and by 16 September they reached the village of Ioribaiwa near Port Moresby . After several weeks of exhausting fighting and heavy losses , the Japanese troops were within 32 kilometres ( 20 mi ) of Port Moresby . Yet supply problems made any further advance impossible , and the Japanese began to fear an Allied counter-landing at Buna . Following reverses at the hands of US forces on Guadalcanal the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters decided they could not support fronts on both New Guinea and Guadalcanal . Horii was subsequently ordered to withdraw his troops on the Kokoda Track until the issue at Guadalcanal was decided . After this , the Australian forces were heavily reinforced by the 7th Division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit , often forcibly , to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel , the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track . In early November , they had been forced into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua . Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November 1942 . The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7th Division and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32nd Infantry Division , and was short of artillery and supplies . Due to a lack of supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey 's insistence on a rapid advance the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications . These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22 January 1943 . Throughout the fighting in Papua , most of the Australian personnel captured by Japanese troops were murdered . In response , for the remainder of the war Australian soldiers generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel and aggressively sought to kill their Japanese opponents including some that had surrendered . Following the defeats in Papua and Guadalcanal the Japanese withdrew to a defensive perimeter in the Territory of New Guinea . Meanwhile , during the fighting in 1942 \u2013 43 the Australian Army increasingly developed a tactical superiority over the Japanese in jungle warfare . The Papuan campaign led to a significant reform in the composition of the Australian Army . During the campaign , the restriction banning Militia personnel from serving outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and Militia . In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943 . This made deploying the Militia easier , but ultimately only one brigade , the 11th , was dispatched outside of Australian territory , being deployed to Merauke on the south coast of Dutch West Papua in the NEI during 1943 and 1944 as part of \" Merauke Force \" . = = = New Guinea offensives = = = After halting the Japanese advance , Allied forces went on the offensive across the SWPA from mid-1943 . Australian forces played a key role throughout this offensive , which was designated Operation Cartwheel . In particular , Blamey oversaw a series of highly successful operations around the north-east tip of New Guinea which \" was the high point of Australia 's experience of operational level command \" during the war . After the successful defence of Wau the 3rd Division began advancing towards Salamaua in April 1943 . This advance was mounted to divert attention from Lae , which was one of the main objectives of Operation Cartwheel , and proceeded slowly . In late June the 3rd Division was reinforced by the US 162nd Regimental Combat Team , which staged an amphibious landing to the south of Salamaua . The town was eventually captured on 11 September 1943 . In early September 1943 Australian-led forces mounted a pincer movement to capture Lae . On 4 September the 9th Division made an amphibious landing to the east of the town and began advancing to the west . The following day , the US 503rd Parachute Regiment made an unopposed parachute drop at Nadzab , just west of Lae . Once the airborne forces secured Nadzab Airfield , the 7th Division was flown in and began advancing to the east in a race with the 9th Division to capture Lae . This race was won by the 7th Division , which captured the town on 15 September . The Japanese forces at Salamaua and Lae suffered heavy losses during this campaign , but were able to escape to the north . After the fall of Lae the 9th Division was given the task of capturing the Huon Peninsula . The 20th Brigade landed near the strategic harbour of Finschhafen on 22 September 1943 and secured the area . The Japanese responded by dispatching the 20th Division overland to the area and the remainder of the 9th Division was gradually brought in to reinforce the 20th Brigade against the expected counter-attack . The Japanese mounted a strong attack in mid-October which was defeated by the 9th Division after heavy fighting . During the second half of November the 9th Division captured the hills inland of Finschhafen from well dug in Japanese forces . Following its defeat , the 20th Division retreated along the coast with the 9th Division and 4th Brigade in pursuit . While the 9th Division secured the coastal region of the Huon Peninsula the 7th Division drove the Japanese from the inland Finisterre Range . The Finisterre Range campaign began on 17 September when the 2 / 6th Independent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley . The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly in the division 's 21st and 25th Brigades . Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack on the key Shaggy Ridge position . The ridge was taken by the end of the month , with the RAAF playing a key supporting role . Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21 April and secured Madang on 24 April . = = = Advance to the Philippines = = = The Australian military 's role in the South-West Pacific decreased during 1944 as US forces took over responsibility for the main Allied effort in the region . In the latter half of 1943 the Australian Government decided , with MacArthur 's agreement , that the size of the military would be decreased to release manpower for war-related industries which were important to supplying Britain and US forces in the Pacific . Australia 's main role in the Allied war effort from this point forward was supplying the other Allied countries with food , materials and manufactured goods needed for the defeat of Japan . As a result of this policy , the size of the Army was reduced from late 1943 onwards , though an offensive force of six infantry divisions ( three AIF and three Militia divisions ) was maintained until the end of the war . In early 1944 all but two of the Army 's divisions were withdrawn to the Atherton Tableland for training and rehabilitation . However , several new battalions of Australian-led Papuan and New Guinea troops were formed during 1944 and organised into the Pacific Islands Regiment . These troops had earlier seen action alongside Australian units throughout the New Guinea campaign , and they largely replaced the Australian Army battalions disbanded during the year . While the Australian Government offered I Corps for use in Leyte and Luzon , nothing came of several proposals to utilise it in the liberation of these islands . The Army 's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern , and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if it could not be used for offensive operations . This was politically embarrassing for the government , and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be used . It also impacted upon the Army 's morale ; as the Allies advanced further towards Japan , the Army was increasingly relegated to \" second string \" roles , despite having fought \" above its weight \" for most of the war . = = = Mopping up in New Guinea and the Solomons = = = In late 1944 , the Australian Government committed twelve Australian Army brigades to replace six US Army divisions which were conducting defensive roles in Bougainville , New Britain and the Aitape \u2013 Wewak area in New Guinea in order to free up the American units for operations in the Philippines . While the US units had largely conducted a static defence of their positions , their Australian replacements mounted offensive operations designed to destroy the remaining Japanese forces in these areas . The value of these campaigns was controversial at the time and remains so to this day as the Australian Government authorised these operations for primarily political , rather than military , reasons . It was believed that keeping the Army involved in the war would give Australia greater influence in any post-war peace conferences and that liberating Australian territories would enhance Australia 's influence in its region . Critics of these campaigns , such as author Peter Charlton , argue that they were unnecessary and wasteful of the lives of the Australian soldiers involved as the Japanese forces were already isolated and ineffective . The 5th Division replaced the US 40th Infantry Division on New Britain during October and November 1944 and continued the New Britain campaign with the goals of protecting Allied bases and confining the large Japanese force on the island to the area around Rabaul . In late November the 5th Division established bases closer to the Japanese perimeter and began aggressive patrols supported by the Allied Intelligence Bureau . The division conducted amphibious landings at Open Bay and Wide Bay at the base of the Gazelle Peninsula in early 1945 and defeated the small Japanese garrisons in these areas . By April the Japanese had been confined to their fortified positions in the Gazelle Peninsula by the Australian force 's aggressive patrolling . The 5th Division suffered 53 fatalities and 140 wounded during this campaign . After the war it was found that the Japanese force was 93,000 strong , which was much higher than the 38,000 which Allied intelligence had estimated remained on New Britain . The II Corps continued the Bougainville campaign after it replaced the US Army 's XIV Corps between October and December 1944 . The corps consisted of the 3rd Division , 11th Brigade and Fiji Infantry Regiment on Bougainville and the 23rd Brigade which garrisoned neighbouring islands and was supported by RAAF , Royal New Zealand Air Force and United States Marine Corps air units . While the XIV Corps had maintained a defensive posture , the Australians conducted offensive operations aimed at destroying the Japanese force on Bougainville . As the Japanese were split into several enclaves the II Corps fought separate offensives in the northern , central and southern portions of the island . The main focus was against the Japanese base at Buin in the south , and the offensives in the north and centre of the island were largely suspended from May 1945 . While Australian operations on Bougainville continued until the end of the war , large Japanese forces remained at Buin and in the north of the island . The 6th Division was assigned responsibility for completing the destruction of the Japanese Eighteenth Army , which was the last large Japanese force remaining in the Australian portion of New Guinea . Supported by several RAAF squadrons and RAN warships , the division was reinforced by Militia and armoured units and began arriving at Aitape in October 1944 . In late 1944 the Australians launched a two-pronged offensive to the east towards Wewak . The 17th Brigade advanced inland through the Torricelli Mountains while the remainder of the division moved along the coast . Although the Eighteenth Army had suffered heavy casualties from previous fighting and disease , it mounted a strong resistance and inflicted significant casualties . The 6th Division 's advance was also hampered by supply difficulties and bad weather . The Australians secured the coastal area by early May , and Wewak was captured on 10 May after a small force was landed east of the town . By the end of the war the Eighteenth Army had been forced into what it had designated its \" last stand \" area . The Aitape \u2013 Wewak campaign cost 442 Australian lives while about 9,000 Japanese died and another 269 were taken prisoner . = = = Borneo campaign = = = The Borneo campaign of 1945 was the last major Allied campaign in the South West Pacific . In a series of amphibious assaults between 1 May and 21 July , the Australian I Corps , under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead , attacked Japanese forces occupying the island . Allied naval and air forces , centred on the US 7th Fleet under Admiral Thomas Kinkaid , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and the US Thirteenth Air Force , also played important roles in the campaign . The goals of this campaign were to capture Borneo 's oilfields and Brunei Bay to support the US-led invasion of Japan and British-led liberation of Malaya which were planned to take place later in 1945 . The Australian Government did not agree to MacArthur 's proposal to extend the offensive to include the liberation of Java in July 1945 , however , and its decision not to release the 6th Division for this operation contributed to it not going ahead . The campaign opened on 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group landed on the small island of Tarakan off the east coast of Borneo to secure the island 's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan . While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip , intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June . As a result , the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile . The next phase began on 10 June when the 9th Division conducted simultaneous assaults in north-west Labuan and on the coast of Brunei . While Brunei was quickly secured , the Japanese garrison on Labuan held out for over a week . After the Brunei Bay region was secured the 24th Brigade was landed in North Borneo and the 20th Brigade advanced along the western coast of Borneo south from Brunei . Both brigades rapidly advanced against weak Japanese resistance and most of north-west Borneo was liberated by the end of the war . During the campaign the 9th Division was assisted by indigenous fighters who were waging a guerrilla war against Japanese forces with the support of Australian special forces such as Z Special Unit . The third and final stage of the campaign was the capture of Balikpapan on the central east coast of Borneo . This operation had been opposed by Blamey , who believed that it was unnecessary , but went ahead on the orders of MacArthur . After a 20-day preliminary air and naval bombardment the 7th Division landed near the town on 1 July . Balikpapan and its surrounds were secured after some heavy fighting on 21 July but mopping up continued until the end of the war as isolated pockets of Japanese resistance remained . The capture of Balikpapan was the last large-scale land operation conducted by the Western Allies during World War II . Although the Borneo campaign was criticised in Australia at the time , and in subsequent years , as pointless or a waste of soldiers ' lives , it did achieve a number of objectives , such as increasing the isolation of significant Japanese forces occupying the main part of the NEI , capturing major oil supplies and freeing Allied prisoners of war , who were being held in deteriorating conditions . = = = Post-war years = = = Prior to the end of the war on 15 August 1945 , the Australian military was preparing to contribute forces to the invasion of Japan . Australia 's participation in this operation would have involved elements of all three services fighting as part of Commonwealth forces . It was planned to form a new 10th Division from existing AIF personnel which would form part of the Commonwealth Corps with British , Canadian and New Zealand units . The corps ' organisation was to be identical to that of a US Army corps , and it would have participated in the invasion of the Japanese home island of Honsh\u016b which was scheduled for March 1946 under Operation Coronet . Planning for operations against Japan ceased in August 1945 when Japan surrendered following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . Japanese field commanders subsequently surrendered to Allied forces across the Pacific Theatre and Australian forces accepted the surrender of their Japanese opponents at ceremonies conducted at Morotai , several locations in Borneo , Timor , Wewak , Rabaul , Bougainville and Nauru . Following the surrender the Australian Army faced a number of immediate operational and administrative issues , including the need to maintain security in the areas it occupied , the disarming and administration of surrendered Japanese forces in these areas , organising the return of approximately 177,000 soldiers ( including prisoners of war ) to Australia , the demobilisation and discharge of the bulk of the soldiers serving in the Army , and the raising of an occupation force for service in Japan . Australian Army units were deployed as occupation forces following the Japanese surrender . Under the terms of an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten , the head of South East Asia Command , Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo , the NEI east of Lombok ( including western New Guinea ) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific . The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945 . I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI , and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea . After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI . While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists , the Australians were careful to not become involved in the Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible . Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good , due in part to the decision by the Waterside Workers ' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI . The last Australian occupation troops left the NEI in February 1946 . The Australian Army also contributed troops to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force ( BCOF ) in Japan . Volunteers for this force were recruited in late 1945 , with most being assigned to three new infantry battalions : the 65th Battalion was formed from volunteers from the 7th Division , the 66th Battalion by men from the 6th Division and the 67th from 9th Division personnel . These and other units were grouped at Morotai as the 34th Brigade in October 1945 . The brigade 's departure for Japan was delayed until February 1946 by inter-Allied negotiations , but it eventually took over responsibility for enforcing the terms of the Japanese surrender in Hiroshima Prefecture . The three infantry battalions raised for occupation duties were designated the 1st , 2nd and 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment in 1949 , and the 34th Brigade became the 1st Brigade when it returned to Australia in December 1948 , forming the basis of the post-war Regular Army . From that time the Australian Army contribution to the occupation of Japan was reduced to a single under-strength battalion . Australian forces remained until September 1951 when the BCOF ceased operations , although by the time the majority of units had been committed to the fighting on the Korean peninsular following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 . = = Leadership = = When the war began the Army was on the cusp of a generational change . At the time , the senior officers on the active list were Major Generals Gordon Bennett and Thomas Blamey , although Bennett had not held an appointment for seven years and Blamey for the last two . Then came the Chief of the General Staff , Major General John Lavarack ; the Adjutant General , Major General Sir Carl Jess ; Major General Owen Phillips , the Quartermaster General ; Major General Edmund Drake-Brockman , the commander of the 3rd Division ; and Major General Iven Mackay , the commander 2nd Division . All were over 50 years of age and all except Bennett , Drake-Brockman and Mackay were serving or former regular soldiers . Only the first three were considered to command the 6th Division and Second AIF , for which posts Blamey was selected by Prime Minister Menzies . Both Blamey and Lavarack were promoted to lieutenant general on 13 October 1939 . Blamey was subsequently appointed General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) I Corps following its raising in March 1940 , while Mackay was appointed to succeed him in command of the 6th Division and Lavarack assumed command of the newly formed 7th Division . The next most senior regular officers , all colonels , included men like Vernon Sturdee , Henry Wynter and John Northcott , all of whom had joined the Army before World War I. These officers held senior commands throughout the war , but seldom active ones . Below them were a distinct group of regular officers , graduates of the Royal Military College , Duntroon , which had opened in 1911 . Their number included Frank Berryman , William Bridgeford , Cyril Clowes , Horace Robertson , Sydney Rowell and George Alan Vasey . These officers had fought in World War I and reached the rank of major , but their promotion prospects were restricted and they remained majors for twenty years . Many left the Army to join the British or Indian armies , or the RAAF , or to return to civilian life . As a group , they had become embittered and resentful , and determined to prove that they could lead troops in battle . Many regular officers had attended training courses or been on exchange with the British Army , which was important in the early years of the war when there was close cooperation between the two armies . Between the wars , the reservists enjoyed much better promotion prospects . While Alan Vasey , a major in the First AIF , was not promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel until 1937 , Kenneth Eather , a reservist who was too young to serve in World War I , was commissioned in 1923 and promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1935 . Menzies ordered that all commands in the 6th Division be given to reservists rather than regular officers , who had become political adversaries through their outspoken opposition to the Singapore strategy . Appointments therefore went to reservists like Stanley Savige , Arthur Allen , Leslie Morshead and Edmund Herring . Later other Militia officers rose to prominence as brigade and division commanders . The distinguished records of officers like Heathcote Hammer , Ivan Dougherty , David Whitehead , Victor Windeyer and Selwyn Porter would challenge the regular officers ' contention that they had a special claim to senior command ability . At the start of the war , the majority of battalion commands went to older reservists , many of whom had commanded battalions or served in the First AIF . As the war went on , the average age of battalion commanders declined from 42.9 years old in 1940 to 35.6 in 1945 . The prevalence of regular officers in senior positions also rose , and in 1945 they held half of all senior appointments . They remained under-represented in unit commands , and , as in 1940 , there was still only one infantry battalion commanded by a regular officer . Following the outbreak of war with Japan , many senior officers with distinguished records in the Middle East were recalled to Australia to lead Militia formations and fill important staff posts as the Army expanded . The following year , though , the Army reached its greatest extent after which it shrank in size . With a limited number of senior appointments and more senior officers than required , Blamey faced public and political criticism after he \" shelved \" several senior officers . The career prospects of junior officer were also affected , particularly in the infantry . Of the 52 officers promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant colonel in the last six months of 1944 only five were infantrymen , while two were engineers , and 45 were from the supporting arms . Meanwhile , the return of the AIF divisions to Australia from the Middle East in 1942 coincided with the arrival of large numbers of American troops , including the US 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions . From April 1942 MacArthur took over command of all US and Australian forces in the newly formed South West Pacific Area as Supreme Commander . Blamey had been appointed Commander-in-Chief AMF in March following his promotion to general , setting up Land Headquarters to subsume the role of the Military Board , which was suspended on 30 July . As Commander-in-Chief AMF he reported directly to MacArthur and was subsequently also given command of Allied Land Forces in the theatre . Yet although Australian forces made up the bulk of the Allied forces in SWPA until 1944 in practice for political reasons MacArthur ensured that Blamey only commanded Australian forces , while he also limited the number of Australian staff officers posted to General Headquarters , and they remained underrepresented for the remainder of the war . = = Equipment = = The Australian Army generally had a long-standing policy of using British-designed equipment , but equipment from Australia , the United States and some other countries was introduced into service in the war 's later years . Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN , which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period . The result was that when war came in 1939 , the Army 's equipment was of World War I vintage , and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms . Most equipment was obsolescent and had to be replaced , and new factories were required to produce the latest weapons , equipment and motor vehicles . Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division , but since a division 's war establishment was around 3,000 , this was only enough for training . In February 1940 , the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes . Throughout the war , Australian infantry units were largely equipped with British-designed but Australian-made small arms and support weapons . The standard rifle was the SMLE No 1 Mk III * , manufactured since 1912 at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory . Small quantities of the Lee \u2013 Enfield No.4 Mk I / Mk I * rifle , made by the Long Branch Arsenal in Canada and Savage-Stevens Firearms in the US , were used in New Guinea although most of these rifles were provided to other branches of the Australian military and to the Volunteer Defence Corps in order to free up No.1 MkIII * rifles for frontline infantry units . American-made M1 Garand semi-automatic rifles and M1 carbines were also issued to some Australian infantry units attached to US Army formations in New Guinea . Direct fire support was provided by a mixture of machine guns , including the Vickers machine gun which was produced at Lithgow from 1929 , which were utilised by specialised machine-gun battalions and , later , also medium machine-gun platoons within infantry battalions . The Bren Gun replaced Lewis Gun as the standard automatic rifle in the early years of the war , and within infantry battalions was utilised at the section level . Their manufacture in Australia started in 1941 . To improve rates of fire , the American Thompson submachine gun was introduced but it was eventually replaced by the Australian-designed Owen Gun and the British-designed but Australian-modified and -made Austen submachine gun . Infantry platoons were also equipped with M36 grenades . The Boys anti-tank rifle was the standard infantry anti-tank weapon at the start of the war , but was replaced with the PIAT in 1943 . The heavier support weapons used by infantry battalions the war included the 2-inch mortar and Stokes 3-inch mortar . Infantry battalions were also equipped with Universal Carriers until being converted to the tropical warfare establishment in 1943 , when the organic carrier platoons were consolidated into companies assigned at divisional level . A man-pack flamethrower was also introduced in 1945 . Not until 17 January 1940 did Richard Casey obtain Cabinet 's approval to spend \u00a3 400,000 to construct a plant to manufacture 25 pounder field guns and 2 pounder anti-tank guns . Until the 25 pounder could become available in quantity , units in Australia and the Far East were equipped with the old 18 pounder . Some units in the Middle East operated the 18 / 25 pounder , an 18 pounder that had been re-bored to take 25 pounder ammunition , until they received British 25 pounders . The old 4.5 inch howitzer also saw service , with the 2 / 10th Field Regiment employing them in support of the 9th Division during the Siege of Tobruk . A collection of captured Italian guns , known as the \" Bush Artillery \" , were also employed . These were rendered obsolete when the 25 pounder became available in quantity . Eventually , 1,527 were manufactured in Australia . A special light weight version known as the Short 25 pounder was developed for jungle warfare . The requirement for a portable field piece in mountainous jungle led to the use of the 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzer in the New Guinea campaign . The American 75 mm Pack Howitzer M1 was also employed . Experience in the Western Desert campaign soon showed that the 2 pounder could not deal with German tanks , and it was superseded by the 6 pounder , which began coming off the assembly lines in Australia in July 1942 . In turn it was replaced in 1944 by the 17 pounder , which was manufactured at the Maribyrnong Ordnance Factory . The anti-aircraft artillery were equipped with the Swedish-designed Bofors 40 mm gun , which was manufactured in Australia , and the British 3.7 inch Anti-Aircraft gun . Medium artillery included the American 155 mm Long Tom and the British 5.5 inch gun . The need for tanks to equip armoured units led the War Cabinet to approve the manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940 . Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943 , but none were used in action . Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas . A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941 , while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942 , and these proved to be the most suitable type for jungle warfare . A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign . The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee . Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions , but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas , they did not see action . An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944 . The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors . The Australian Army developed its own landing craft . Development of an Australian version of the Landing Craft Assault , the ALCV ( Australian Landing Craft , Vehicle ) , was carried out by Army personnel working alongside the Ford Motor Company . Prototypes were constructed by sappers and launched on the Brisbane River . The initial version , known as the ALCV I was found to be too small , so the larger 12-metre ALCV II was developed . An Australian version of the Landing Craft Mechanized , the ALCM , was also developed and manufactured by Ford in Brisbane and later at Geelong . Operational experience demonstrated the need for larger landing craft , so the ALCV III , an enlarged version of the ALCM II with four Ford V8 engines and twice the cargo capacity , was produced . The Army also ordered 15 ALCM IIIs , a type of similar capacity to an American Landing Craft Tank , with five Ford V8 engines . Only four were delivered before the end of the war , but they arrived in time to see service in New Guinea . By 1945 , due to a shrinking number of operational units and stepped up production , equipment shortages were a thing of the past . Indeed , the Army had more equipment that it actually needed . For example , a total of 368 25 pounders were required for combat and 38 for training but there were a total of 1,516 on hand . Additionally , a total of 530 2 pounder and 6 pounder anti-tank guns were required , but the Army had 1,941 , while 68 3.7 inch anti-aircraft guns were needed for combat and five for training , but there were 640 pieces available . Similar surpluses existed with small arms such as the Bren , of which 9,438 were required , but there were 21,139 in the system . The situation in relation to Bren gun carriers was even more marked with only 123 of the 3,767 vehicles actually being required , due to the decreased requirements for mobility vehicles in jungle warfare . = = Training and doctrine = = The Australian Army 's pre-war doctrine was focused on conventional warfare in a European environment . This doctrine and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries . Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa . By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment . However , there were also critical shortages of instructors . The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel , but there were few officers and men with the required skills in the small pre-war Army and many of them were already serving in the AIF 's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments . An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal , Victoria , in 1941 , and in March 1943 , the Armoured Corps Training Centre was moved there . Another problem for the Militia was a lack of continuity in the training . When the war began , men were called up for only one month 's additional training . This was then increased to three months ' additional training . In 1940 \u2013 41 , officers and non-commissioned officers were intensively trained for 18 to 24 days , after which there was a camp for 70 days . Meanwhile , soldiers who had been through the 90-day training regimen in 1939 \u2013 40 were given 12 days ' additional training , while those who had not completed this training undertook 70 days . This allowed for individual training , but prevented proper unit training . In July 1941 , fully trained soldiers who had completed 90 days ' training became liable for three months ' additional training per year while new recruits were liable for six months . At the same time , the War Cabinet provided for more intensive training for the full-time cadre of Militia units , which were not to exceed 25 percent of the unit 's strength . Training for the Militia and the VDC was also hampered in the early war years by a lack of small arms , particularly after the Dunkirk evacuation when Australia dispatched its reserve stock of rifles to Britain , in an effort to help replace equipment lost by the British Army , amidst concerns of an invasion of the United Kingdom after the Fall of France . Although the Army 's focus was on conventional warfare , in late 1940 Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood , a British officer , arrived in Australia with a small specialist staff to conduct training in unconventional warfare . A school , known as No. 7 Infantry Training Centre , was opened at Wilsons Promontory , Victoria , which was described as \" an isolated area of high , rugged and heavily timbered mountains , precipitous valleys , swiftly running streams , and swamps . \" The 1st , 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies and a nucleus of the 4th were raised by October 1941 when training was discontinued . After the outbreak of the war with Japan , the school was reopened as the Guerrilla Warfare School , the training of the fourth company was completed . These independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons , of which twelve were eventually raised , including the 1st , which had been destroyed early in the war ; as the war progressed they were used more in the flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare . The Australian Army did not have any doctrine for jungle warfare prior to 1942 . Some lessons were passed on by officers who escaped from Malaya and Singapore , however , and these were incorporated into a training memorandum in May that year . AIF units that returned from North Africa undertook some training in jungle tactics before going into action , but the Militia units which initially faced the Japanese in New Guinea suffered from inadequate training , and this led to them suffering heavy casualties . In order to be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly , to acclimatise them during the process , and to allow more realistic training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain , Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942 . Eventually , accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops . As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944 , they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment . The men then went on leave , after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again . In early 1943 the Army developed a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations to meet the conditions in the South-West Pacific . The Army 's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with this doctrine during the year . A jungle warfare school was opened at Canungra , Queensland , in November 1942 , and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit . Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre , an Independent Company training centre , and a tactical school . With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed . Over time , training programs included greater cooperation between the Army 's combat arms and with the other services . A Combined Training Centre , also known as HMAS Assault , opened on 1 September 1942 at Nelson Bay , adjacent to Port Stephens , New South Wales , as a central establishment for the training staffs , beach parties and small boat crews . In July 1942 , a Combined Training School was established at Bribie Island , Queensland , and nearby Toorbul Point for Army units . During 1943 and 1944 , combined training with the RAAF and RAN was also carried out at Trinity Beach , near Cairns in preparation for amphibious operations in the South West Pacific as the Allies advanced . The Australian Army began training paratroops in December 1942 as an offshoot of the training of Independent Companies . The 1st Parachute Battalion was subsequently formed in March 1943 . It reached full strength by January 1944 , but , although it was warned for action a number of times , including the possible rescue of prisoners of war held at Sandakan in 1945 , it did not see any fighting . After the war it participated in the reoccupation of Singapore . By 1945 the Army possessed a comprehensive schools system , with 40 schools of various kinds . Between 1942 and 1945 96,000 training courses were conducted . Soldiers who were selected to become officers were trained at various Officer Cadet Training Units around the country , and by the end of the war these units had produced 7,887 officers . Meanwhile , regular officers of the PMF continued to be trained at the Royal Military College , Duntroon with a number of shortened courses of between six months and a years ' duration being run . Unlike the First AIF , newly commissioned lieutenants were not sent back to their original unit , but were posted to the first vacancy . Other schools included the School of Artillery , the Guerrilla Warfare School , the Cooking and Catering School , the School of Military Law and the School of Movement and Transport . Recruit training was now thorough and exacting , and for infantrymen culminated in a jungle training course at Canungra , where the Jungle Warfare School turned out 4,000 reinforcements a month . In 1945 , the 29th Brigade received 1,000 young reinforcements shortly before embarking for Torokina , but their commander later remarked that their training at Canungra had been so thorough that they \" reacted with almost miraculous quickness to conditions of battle . \" = = Prisoners of war = = Nearly 29,000 Australians were taken prisoner by the Axis during the war , the bulk of them members of the Australian Army . During the fighting in the Middle East and Greece , 7,116 Australian soldiers were taken prisoner by German and Italian forces . Of these men , 3,109 were captured at Crete and 2,065 on the mainland of Greece . Most of the other POWs were members of the 9th Division captured during the retreat from Cyrenaica in early 1941 , the siege of Tobruk or the fighting near El Alamein in mid-1942 . Like other western Allied POWs , the Australians were held in permanent camps in Italy and Germany and were generally treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions . As the war neared its end the Germans moved many prisoners towards the interior of the country to prevent them from being liberated by the advancing Allied armies . These movements were often made through forced marches in harsh weather and resulted in many deaths . As the war drew to a close , a unit designated the AIF Reception Group ( United Kingdom ) was established near Eastbourne in England to provide accommodation and support for the POWs once they were released . By August 1945 all the former Australian POWs in Europe had embarked on ships bound for Australia . While Australian prisoners suffered a higher death rate in German and Italian captivity than their counterparts in World War I , it was much lower than the rate suffered under Japanese internment . More than 21,000 members of the AIF were captured by the Japanese during the first months of 1942 . Most of these men were members of the 8th Division captured at Singapore , the NEI and Rabaul , but about 2,000 members of the I Corps party sent to Java in early 1942 were taken prisoner there . Throughout captivity these POWs were treated harshly , resulting in a high death rate . Australians were held in camps across the Asia-Pacific region and many endured long voyages in grossly overcrowded ships . While most of the Australian POWs who died in Japanese captivity were the victim of deliberate malnutrition and disease , hundreds were murdered by their guards . The Burma-Thai Railway was the most notorious of the prisoner of war experiences , as 13,000 Australians worked on it at various times during 1942 and 1943 alongside thousands of other Allied POWs and Asians conscripted by the Japanese ; nearly 2,650 Australians died there . Thousands of Australian POWs were also sent to the Japanese home islands where they worked in factories and mines in generally harsh conditions . The POWs held in camps at Ambon and Borneo suffered the highest death rates ; 77 percent of those at Ambon died and few of the 2,500 Australian and British prisoners in Borneo survived ; almost all were killed by overwork and a series of death marches in 1945 . Overall , only 14,000 of the Australian prisoners taken by the Japanese survived captivity . The majority of these deaths were caused by malnutrition and disease . The treatment of the POWs prompted many Australians to remain hostile towards Japan after the war . Australian authorities investigated the abuses against Allied POWs in their country 's zone of responsibility after the war , and guards who were believed to have mistreated prisoners were among those tried by Australian-administered war crimes trials . = = Demobilisation = = The process of demobilisation began immediately after the end of hostilities , although it had partially commenced as early as 1943 . At the end of the war the strength of the Australian Army was 398,594 men , approximately half of which were serving overseas in the South West Pacific Area . The demobilisation plan was put into action on 16 August 1945 , the day after Japan surrendered . Undertaken in four phases , it was finally completed on 15 February 1947 by which time a total of 349,964 soldiers had been discharged . Although the process largely proceeded smoothly , many soldiers felt it was too slow and there was widespread dissatisfaction among men continuing to serve in the South West Pacific after the war ended . The speed of demobilisation was hampered by the requirement to continue to maintain security in the areas still occupied , the lack of sufficient shipping , the administrative workload entailed , and limited facilities for use for the demobilisation process . Although the Second AIF was not disbanded until 30 June 1947 a temporary organisation known as the Interim Army was established at the end of the war and included all members of the Army on full-time duty . Meanwhile , in a departure from previous defence policy the Australian government decided that a small peace-time regular force was to be raised to provide a trained , full-time force capable of being deployed either in Australia or overseas in a national emergency and the Australian Regular Army was subsequently established on 30 September 1947 . The Militia , under the guise of the Citizen Military Forces , was re-established on 1 July 1948 to provide a part-time volunteer force which would be able to provide the basis for expansion in wartime . = = Casualties = = In the course of the fighting the Australian Army sustained approximately 61,000 battle casualties , the bulk of them from the Second AIF . This included 11,323 killed in action , 1,794 died of wounds , and 21,853 wounded . 5,558 were killed or died in captivity , while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war . Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded / injured in operational areas , and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded / injured in non-operational areas . The large number of non-battle casualties was significant , illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army .",

He served as a municipal councillor and briefly as the third mayor of Edmonton . Gallagher was born in New Brunswick in 1854 , the son of an Irish immigrant father . After attending the schools of his birthplace , he moved west to Winnipeg with his family , and became involved in the family meat packing business , established by his father . He would soon move west again to what would later become the province of Saskatchewan , where he would continue his business , providing his product to the local police establishments and soldiers during the North-West Rebellion . After his contracts expired there , Gallagher would move again further west , to Edmonton , where he would permanently settle . In Edmonton he established the developing town 's largest meat packing business , upon land atop the banks of the North Saskatchewan River , overlooking the river valley . He would also get involved with the city 's local politics , sitting on the Edmonton Town Council in the 1890s and early 1900s . In 1896 , after the incumbent mayor had resigned , the town council selected Gallagher to briefly be the interim mayor until an election was held later that year . He served one more aldermanic term , but retired after defeat in the 1903 and 1907 elections . In 1911 , he would also retire from his meat business . In retirement , Gallagher lived on a lavish estate on land he owned atop the Edmonton River Valley until his death in 1932 . = = Early life and career = = Gallagher was born on December 31 , 1854 in Saint John , New Brunswick to Patrick and Katherine ( n\u00e9e Maher ) Gallagher . His father , Patrick came to Canada from Ireland at the age of 14 , and worked in the meat industry , being a wholesale meat merchant and meat packer . His mother was a native of Saint John . Cornelius Gallagher would attend schooling during the 1870s in his hometown ; later joining his father in his meat business . When his father relocated to Winnipeg in 1877 , he established a wholesale and retail meat distribution business , P. Gallagher and Son , which Cornelius and his brother , Edward would work in . Cornelius Gallagher in 1888 moved to Battleford , North-West Territory ( today in Saskatchewan ) in 1888 , where he bought out his father 's firm 's interests . There , he was on a contract to supply troops stationed in the aftermath of the suppression of the North-West Rebellion . In 1889 , he moved south to Regina , where his business , Childs & Gallagher , supplied meat to the North-West Mounted Police . He remained there for two years , until 1891 , when his contract with the Mounties expired . = = Career in Edmonton = = In 1891 , Gallagher relocated , this time to Edmonton , also located in the then-Northwest Territories . He had been intrigued with the fact that majority of the territory 's wheat and vegetable crops came from the Edmonton area , and scenting a business opportunity , decided to settle there . Purchasing a lot for his business less than 24 hours after arriving in Edmonton , Gallagher established with Calgary based businessman , William Roper Hull , the Gallagher-Hull Meat Company , a wholesale and retail butcher . Incorporated on January 6 , 1900 , the establishment was a two-storey brick building located on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River , from which the establishment relied on for its freshwater supply . It contained rooms for slaughtering the animals , storage , butchering and preparation of the meat . Offering a variety of different proteins , such as veal , beef , lamb , turkey , chicken , goose , and pork , the business rose to become the largest of its kind in the developing city of Edmonton , producing over 200,000 pounds ( 91,000 kg ) of meat per year by the turn of the century . He would operate the establishment until his retirement in 1911 . He also had interests in the brick industry , founding and serving as president of a local brick company . = = = Civic politics = = = Gallagher first sought public office in 1893 , when he was elected to Edmonton Town Council . In an aldermanic race in which the top six candidates were elected , he gained the final spot . On his first term on council he sat on the Licensing , and Health & Relief committees . He was re-elected in 1894 , again placing sixth of nine candidates . Once this term expired in 1896 , Gallagher stayed out of politics for several months until mayor Herbert Charles Wilson resigned over a dispute involving town funds . It fell to the council to fill the mayor 's position . Gallagher was nominated by John Cameron and John Kelly ; as there were no rival candidates , he won by acclamation . He was the first mayor of Edmonton never to be elected to that position ; ( Frederick John Mitchell and Terry Cavanagh would later join him in that distinction ) . He was sworn in at the town council meeting on October 27 , 1896 . During his brief term as mayor , Gallagher oversaw the town during a time when many prospectors headed to the Klondike Gold Rush saw Edmonton as a stopover point . He also become the inaugural president of the Edmonton Hockey Club when it was founded on November 20 , 1896 . In the ensuing election , Gallagher chose to run for alderman rather than seeking a full term as mayor . This remains the only time in the city 's history that a sitting mayor has run for alderman . He was elected , placing fifth of nine candidates . During this term he sat on committees involved in issues relating to finance , police and utilities ( fire , water and light ) . He did not seek re-election in the election in December 1897 . In December 1898 Gallagher ran for mayor , but was defeated by William S. Edmiston . He stayed out of politics until 1901 , when he was elected to a two-year term as alderman . He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1903 , placing fifth of nine candidates ( the staggered two year aldermanic terms meant that only three of the council 's six aldermen were elected each election ) . His last bid for office took place during the 1907 election , when he placed eleventh of twelve candidates in the aldermanic race . = = Personal life = = In Edmonton , Gallagher resided in a \" grand house \" at 9902 111 Street , overlooking Edmonton 's river valley .

Avidly involved in community affairs , Gallagher was a member and president of both the Edmonton Board of Trade ( 1898 ) and Edmonton Exhibition Association . He was a member of the Conservative Party of Alberta and president of the Liberal-Conservative Association of Strathcona , and was of the Roman Catholic faith .

The 1912 publication , History of the province of Alberta , states the following : In view of success to which Cornelius Gallagher has attained , it is but just to enter somewhat in detail concerning the plans and methods he has followed and the characteristics which he has manifested in an industrial and commercial career marked by consecutive progress . His business connections from the beginning continually broadened in their scope and importance and force of character and well developed talents have made in a power in the field of commercial , industrial and financial activity . In business affairs he is energetic , prompt , and notably reliable , while his social qualities have rendered him very popular . Tireless energy , keen perception , honesty of purpose , a genius for devising and executing the right thing at the right time , joined every-day common sense , are his chief characteristics . Gallagher Park ( formerly named Grassy Hill ) , in the Cloverdale area in Edmonton is named in his honour . The park is known for hosting the annual Edmonton Folk Music Festival .",

On January 10 , 1788 , Wodrow was recommended to the position of major in the Hampshire County militia . Later , in March 1788 , Wodrow , along with Ralph Humphreys , was elected to represent Hampshire County at the Virginia Ratifying Convention held to ratify the United States Constitution . The Virginia Ratifying Convention convened in Richmond in June 1788 , with Wodrow and Humphreys both voting \" aye \" in favor of ratification . During the lead up to the War of 1812 , Wodrow chaired an anti-war meeting in Hampshire County at which those assembled objected to a heedless rush to war with the British , which was in line with contemporary Federalist principles . According to historian Stuart L. Butler , Wodrow and the meeting 's attendees felt that : to involve [ the United States ] in an expensive and uncertain war , for purposes not absolutely necessary , and entail taxes and misery on ourselves and our posterity , when we might enjoy the blessings of peace and plenty and a good price for our produce on terms as honorable at least as those for the last fifteen years past , would appear to them the extreme of folly , little short of madness . Wodrow and the committee believed that within two years of the war 's beginning , it would become unpopular because of the need for increased taxation and prolonged military service . Wodrow and the committee stated , \" the nation would rise in its constitutional strength , and say to those who brought about such an unpropitious state of things , ' depart from ye wicked . ' \" Wodrow served as the clerk of court for Hampshire County for a tenure spanning 32 years until his death at his residence in Romney in 1814 . Following his death , Wodrow 's son-in-law Samuel McGuire served the remainder of his term for fifteen months until 1815 when he was succeeded by John Baker White . West Virginia historian Wilmer L. Kerns said of Wodrow in Hampshire County , West Virginia , 1754 \u2013 2004 ( 2004 ) that he \" was a prominent and scholarly man , successful in his business , and a good politician . \" = = Land affairs and holdings = = In 1782 , Wodrow served as an executor of the last will and testament of his uncle Alexander Wodrow , a wealthy merchant , and sold his personal estate , a moiety of two land lots in Falmouth , and 212 acres ( 0.86 km2 ) along the Rappahannock River in Stafford County to pay his uncle 's debts , with the remainder of the proceeds directed to his other family members . Wodrow sought permission from the Virginia General Assembly to sell the remainder of Alexander Wodrow 's landholdings in Frederick , Hampshire , and Stafford counties , which he was granted . In addition to his landholdings , Wodrow was also charged with the sale of his uncle 's slaves , furniture , watches , buckles , and several personal items . Wodrow personally inherited his uncle 's riding horse and \" wearing apparel . \" After his move to Romney , Wodrow began to amass numerous properties and became a prosperous landholder in Hampshire County . In 1788 , Wodrow purchased a land tract consisting of 100 acres ( 0.40 km2 ) along the Cacapon River in Hampshire County . On December 4 , 1789 , Wodrow was appointed by an act of the Virginia General Assembly as a trustee of the town of Romney . He served as a trustee alongside Isaac Miller , Isaac Parsons , Stephen Colvin , Jonathan Purcell , Nicholas Casey , William McGuire , Perez Drew , and James Murphy . Wodrow and his fellow trustees were given authority by the Virginia General Assembly to settle disputes regarding the town 's land lots and to \" open and clear \" the town 's \" streets and lanes \" in accordance with the original survey and plan for Romney . Wodrow was again appointed by an act of the Virginia General Assembly on December 27 , 1800 to a second board of trustees governing Watson Town ( present-day Capon Springs ) , and charged with laying off land lots , streets , and a half-acre lot containing the mineral spring for public use along Capon Springs Run . On October 4 , 1808 , Wodrow and fellow trustee Henry Beattie conveyed Lot No. 2 in Watson Town to Lawrence Augustine Washington a nephew of then former President George Washington . The location of Watson Town is the present-day site of Capon Springs Resort . = = = Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House = = = Wodrow and his wife Mary Ann inherited her father Colonel George Wilson 's residence on the eastern boundary of Lot 48 in Romney following his death in 1777 and made it their home . During the 1770s and 1780s , Wodrow 's residence was located on what was then the \" main street \" in Romney , presently known as Gravel Lane . During his tenure as clerk of court , Wodrow constructed a two-and-one-half story office building adjacent to this residence and its kitchen , all three of which are extant and contribute to the structure presently known as the Wilson-Wodrow-Mytinger House at 51 West Gravel Lane . The adjoining edifice , built by Wodrow for the handling of his clerk of court affairs , is believed to be the oldest extant public office building within the present-day state of West Virginia . Wodrow \" went to great expense to add beauty and dignity \" to his office building , incorporating architectural styles of panelling and woodworking prevalent in both Fredericksburg and Williamsburg . Following Wodrow 's death , his residence was owned by his son-in-law John McDowell . = = = Old Presbyterian Churchyard = = = Wodrow was a dynamic and influential member of the Presbyterian Church , and in his will , he granted two land lots ( Lots No. 59 and No. 60 ) south of West Gravel Lane from his residence for the construction of Romney 's first Presbyterian church building and the establishment of a cemetery . Wodrow 's executor , James Dailey , deeded the two land lots on April 1 , 1816 to Mount Bethel Congregation trustees James Beach , William Inskeep , Adam Hare , and John Lawson for these purposes . Wodrow was interred in this cemetery ( later known as \" the Old Presbyterian Cemetery \" ) which was located atop the hill of the two lots . The Presbyterian church was built near the corner of West Gravel Lane and South High Streets between 1812 and 1816 . The Old Presbyterian Cemetery fell into neglect by the late 19th century and was destroyed around 1940 when the hill on which it was located was cut away and leveled for the construction of a factory . Although some human remains and headstones were relocated to Indian Mound Cemetery , Wodrow 's remains were likely lost during the destruction of the cemetery . = = Personal life = = = = = Marriage and issue = = = Wodrow married Mary Ann Wilson , the daughter of Colonel George Wilson . Wodrow and his wife Mary Ann had at least five children : Matilda Wodrow McDowell , married to John McDowell ; an unnamed daughter , married to Samuel McGuire ; Craig Wodrow ; Emily Jean Wodrow Kercheval , married to lawyer Samuel Kercheval , Jr . , son of Virginia historian Samuel Kercheval ; and Elizabeth Wodrow Dailey , married to James Dailey . Wodrow 's son , Craig Wodrow , was a scholar , but due to his chronic poor health , he was unable to pursue active roles in business or politics . Craig Wodrow was also interred in the Old Presbyterian Cemetery in Romney .",

He served on the Edmonton City Council and later as Mayor of Edmonton from 1905 to 1906 . A native of what would become the province of Ontario , May moved to Manitoba soon after completing education in his hometown . In Manitoba , he would take to briefly farming , before entering into the construction industry , which he would establish prominence in . After doing work for the railway , he would move to Winnipeg where he would join a contracting firm and become involved in the construction of many buildings . After moving west and living briefly in Carberry , Manitoba , May came to Edmonton in 1902 . In Edmonton he would rise to be one of the city 's most prominent contractors , constructing many of the city 's landmark buildings , as well as houses for its prominent residents . Long interested in municipal affairs , he entered civic politics with his election to the Edmonton Town Council in 1903 . After an aldermanic term that saw the inclusion of Alberta as a province in Canada , in 1905 he was elected as mayor of the newly incorporated city ; during his term he would oversee many improvements and advances to the city . Retiring after one term in office and returning to his contracting firm , he would eventually leave Edmonton in 1922 for Vancouver where he would live for 10 years leading up to his death in 1932 . An active community man , May also founded and oversaw many local organizations . A Liberal in politics , he is remembered as a progressive mayor whose policies helped the accelerate development of city of Edmonton . = = Early life and career = = May was born in Wellington County , Canada West in 1858 , to John and Helen ( n\u00e9e Esson ) May . Both of his parents were immigrants who had come to Canada early in their lives , his father originally from County Londonderry , Ireland , was a veteran of the 1837 Upper Canada Rebellion , and his mother a native of Aberdeenshire , Scotland . Charles attended and completed public schooling in Wellington County , and around 1871 the May family relocated to Paisley , Ontario . Upon the death of his father shortly thereafter , May was tasked with the responsibilities of heading and providing for his family , along with a brother , Thomas . In 1880 , after the closing of his father 's estate and sale his father 's property , he moved west to homestead and farm at Manitoba , in the Little Saskatchewan district , near Minnedosa . A few years later , he had come to the realization that farming was not an efficient means of business for him ; his farm had been situated in an area that was so far removed from a town that travel to deliver his products had been cumbersome . He then gained employment as a carpenter and builder with the Manitoba and North Western Railway , where he was tasked with building rail bridges and stations . He would later move to Winnipeg where he continued working in his field . He would join the contracting firm of Murray & McDermot , serving as foreman on various projects , including the building of the Manitoba Hotel . After some 13 years , he went to Carberry , Manitoba where he continued contracting , this time also entering the furniture business . In 1902 , he would also be involved in the construction of the Union Bank building there . = = Career in Edmonton = = Later in 1902 , May once again moved , this time further west to the town of Edmonton , in the North-West Territory . Upon his arrival there , he would purchase several lots of land on which he would construct a series of cottages , houses and terraces that he would later sell . In Edmonton , he would establish himself as a prominent contractor , building many notable early buildings of the town , and later city . He partnered with Charles W. Sharpe and established the May-Sharpe Construction company . With his firm , buildings he was involved in constructing included the town 's first Canadian Northern Railway station , a post office , the Bank of Montreal , Merchants ' Bank and Bank of Commerce buildings , the Hudson 's Bay Company store , the first provincial penitentiary building , and the residences of city notables Richard Secord , Frank Oliver and Edward Ainslie Braithwaite . He was also involved in the construction of the Clover Bar railway bridge , for which he set the concrete piers and foundation , as well as the Land Titles Building in Regina , Saskatchewan . From 1909 to 1912 , May would also construct the still-standing LeMarchand mansion , atop the North Saskatchewan River Valley as well as assist in the construction of McDougall United Church . The LeMarchand mansion construction however would bankrupt him and force him to move to a cottage on Koney Island on Cooking Lake , beside the present day Edmonton / Cooking Lake Water Aerodrome in Strathcona County , until his debts were settled . In 1921 , he did work at Fort Smith , Northwest Territories , as superintendent of the Windsor Transportation Company . = = = Civic politics = = = Keenly interested in the well-being of citizens and affairs related to the development of the growing town , he was nominated for and eventually elected to Edmonton Town Council as an alderman in 1903 , finishing first of nine candidates , with 421 votes . His term was to last two years , but was truncated by a year by Edmonton 's incorporation as a city , which meant that the entire city council was elected afresh in the 1904 election . In that election he was again elected to a two-year term , finishing first of seventeen candidates , but this time resigned one year into his term in order to run for mayor in the 1905 election . May 's time on council included the time in which Alberta was incorporated as a province ; as an alderman he voiced his support for a lavish celebration to be in Edmonton , which was to be the capital city of the new province . While sitting on council , he also voted against a proposed bylaw that would have permitted suffrage for women in civic elections ; he had initially voted in favour of the law , but had later reconsidered and reversed his vote , effectively killing the bill . The vote previously had been in favour of the bill , by a margin of one vote . As the popular choice leading into the election , he handily defeated fellow councillor Arthur Cushing by a count of 627 votes to 355 , and thus became mayor of Edmonton . He served in this capacity for one term of one year , but did not seek re-election in 1906 and retired from political life thereafter . It was during May 's term as mayor in which the municipal foundations of Edmonton were set ; he oversaw the purchase of the road maintenance equipment , the city 's first telephone system as well as the upgrade of the street car system to steel rails and posts , purchase of land for municipal use , paving of roads , and negotiations for the establishment of a manufacturing plant in the city . He also travelled to Toronto to lobby for a new union railway station in Edmonton to be constructed for use by the Grand Trunk , Canadian Northern and Canadian Pacific Railways . It was also during May 's term which the Alberta Legislature Building would first open its doors , which he would participate in its opening ceremonies . In 1911 , he would be named a returning officer for Edmonton , in charge of overseeing the Canadian federal election , 1911 . = = Personal life = = May was active with the Masonic Order , the Presbyterian Church , and the Liberal Party of Alberta . He also was a member of the Edmonton Exhibition Association , Old Timers ' Association as well as a director and manager with the Alberta Lumber Company , founder and president of the Edmonton Kennel Club , and one of the founders of a local contractors ' association . In 1906 , May was involved in the planning of the first provincial fair in Alberta . May married Ann Galbraith at Saugeen , Ontario in 1882 ; they would have two children and remain married until she died suddenly in 1897 . He remarried in 1901 , to Margaret Henderson with whom he had three additional children . One son , Norman was killed in an accident while working on the Grand Trunk Railway in Wolf Creek , Alberta . Charles May was also the uncle of famed aviator and flying ace Wop May , the latter being a son of his brother , Alexander Esson May . Alexander May was a former mayor of Carberry , Manitoba , postmaster of Edmonton , as well as an unsuccessful Liberal Candidate in the Canadian federal election , 1917 , in the riding of Edmonton East . = = = Death and legacy = = = He moved to Vancouver , British Columbia in 1922 , and following a long period of illness , he died of stomach cancer there on March 1 , 1932 , aged 73 . He was survived by his wife , a daughter and four sons . Margeret May later died in 1949 . Regarded as a progressive and energetic mayor , upon his death , the Edmonton Bulletin noted regarding his mayoral term that \" his progressive and constructive policies did much to advance the progress of Edmonton \" . The 1912 publication , History of the province of Alberta , praised May 's stern and ambitious personality , stating that \" in the most adverse circumstances [ he ] endured with fortitude \" .",

                    "text": "John Hugill = John William Hugill ( October 3 , 1881 \u2013 January 13 , 1971 ) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as Attorney General of the province of Alberta from 1935 until 1937 . Born in England , he came to Canada and studied law before setting up a practice in Calgary . He became a prominent resident of that city , and served two years on its city council . In the early 1930s , he was one of the few prominent and respectable Calgarians to support William Aberhart 's Social Credit League . He ran as a candidate for it in the 1935 provincial election and , when it won , was named Attorney General by Aberhart . Hugill 's time as Member of the Legislative Assembly ( MLA ) was dominated by differences of opinion with Aberhart . Hugill did not believe that social credit could be legally implemented by a provincial government and did not support the government 's attempts to do so . When asked by Lieutenant Governor John Campbell Bowen whether he considered three of the government 's acts to be constitutional , he replied honestly that he did not ; this prompted Aberhart to request his resignation . Thereafter Hugill was an outspoken opponent of the Aberhart government , though he did not seek re-election in the 1940 election . He retired from the practice of law in 1949 , and died in 1971 . = = Early life = = John Hugill was born in West Hartlepool , Yorkshire , October 3 , 1881 . He studied at the City of London School before immigrating to Canada in 1896 . Settling in Nova Scotia , he attended King 's Collegiate School to complete his matriculation , after which he attended King 's College , from which he earned a Bachelor of Civil Law and later a Doctor of Civil Law . Beginning in 1898 , he worked for Furness-Withy & Company , Limited , a steamship operator , in Canada and England . From 1904 until 1907 he was a political agent in London , after which he returned to Canada to read law in the Calgary office of future Prime Minister of Canada R. B. Bennett . He was called to the bars of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1910 , and subsequently earned a Bachelor of Laws from the University of Manitoba . After being called to the bar , Hugill worked for several years as a lawyer for the Canadian Pacific Railway . In 1920 , he opened his own practice in Calgary , and was made King 's Counsel in July 1921 . On July 10 , 1913 , he married Eelen Cameron Templeton , with whom he would have three children . Hugill was active in Calgary society , and specifically with the Anglican Church of Canada , the Masons , the Calgary Board of Trade , the Calgary Ranchmen 's Club , the Calgary Polo Club , the Calgary Golf & Country Club , and the Calgary branch of Canadian Authors . He was also a major in the Calgary Highlanders . Outside of Calgary , he was a member of the Edmonton Club and London 's British Empire Club . His hobbies included golf , polo , and big game hunting . He was also held a lifetime membership in the Alpine Club , which he was awarded for reaching the summit of Mount Stephen . Hugill was consul to Sweden and vice consul to the Netherlands for fifteen years . = = Political career = = Hugill served as Calgary alderman from 1921 \u2013 1923 . During this term , he was twice acting Mayor of Calgary . One of these occasions included a visit to Calgary by Julian Byng , 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy , the Governor General . In the early 1930s , Hugill was one of the few members of Calgary 's social and business elite to support William Aberhart 's burgeoning Social Credit League . Despite this , he was not an adherent of social credit monetary theories , but joined Social Credit because he viewed it as a vehicle of reform . He was also concerned about the constitutionality of a provincial government legislating on banking and monetary issues , as was advocated by many Social Crediters , and sought ( and , by his account , received ) assurances from Aberhart that no such legislation would be forthcoming from a Social Credit government . Athabasca University historian Alvin Finkel suggest that Hugill 's initial support of Social Credit was opportunistic , and not born of any belief in its rightness . If Hugill 's allegiance to Social Credit was incongruous , his allegiance to Aberhart was even more so . Aberhart , a radio evangelist , did not share Hugill 's taste for fine wines , cigars , or flippant humour . Hugill , for his part , objected to Aberhart 's belief in the occult , and in particular to his practice of numerology . About his eventual presence in cabinet , McGill University 's J. R. Mallory said \" one can imagine the discomfort of an experienced barrister ... moderate in his political views and absorbed principally in his departmental duties , confronted by a cabinet of hot gospellers , presided over by the Messianic Mr. Aberhart . \" = = = Election as MLA = = = Whatever the surface incompatibilities between Hugill and the Social Credit movement , in the runup to the 1935 provincial election Aberhart found his team lacking both mainstream respectability and legal expertise , and so recruited Hugill to run as a Social Credit candidate in Calgary . During the campaign , Hugill attracted attention by refusing ( on Aberhart 's instructions , and like other Social Credit candidates ) to accept questions from the floor at political meetings . The Calgary Albertan took note of this practice , commenting \" it must be rather irritating for a gentleman like J. W. Hugill , a practitioner at the bar and a King 's Counsel withal , skilled and experienced in the art of debate , not to be free to make use of it \" . On August 22 , Hugill was elected one of Calgary 's six Members of the Legislative Assembly ( MLAs ) . On the initial ballot count he was in fifth place of twenty candidates , but after the redistribution of votes in accordance with the single transferable vote system in use in Calgary at the time , he fell to sixth place , and was not elected until the eighteenth and final count . Aberhart named him Attorney General several days later , and he was sworn in with the rest of Aberhart 's cabinet on September 3 , 1935 . = = = Attorney General = = = Hugill 's service as Attorney General was brief and eventful . Three days after their swearing-in , he and Aberhart embarked for Ottawa to meet with Bennett , now prime minister , and seek a federal loan to prevent Alberta from defaulting on its bond and payroll obligations . Despite needing C $ 18 million , they secured only $ 2.25 million from Bennett . They then set out for Detroit to meet with Henry Ford \u2014 who had financed many of his projects without involving banks , Social Credit 's sworn enemies \u2014 but , on their arrival , discovered that he was away at his summer home . Returning home still in need of funding , Aberhart authorized Hugill to negotiate for the services of Robert J. Magor , a Montreal financier who had successfully assisted the government of Newfoundland in emerging from dire financial straits . Magor 's acceptance of a $ 600 per month appointment raised the ire of Social Crediters loyal to C. H. Douglas , the originator of social credit , and of Douglas himself , who saw Magor as a tool of eastern financial interests and Hugill as their man inside the government . Magor 's financial advice led to the government tabling a very conservative 1936 budget that was decidedly not in keeping with social credit ideals . Partly in response to the situation , British social crediter John Hargrave visited Alberta to advise the government on how it might implement social credit . At a cabinet meeting with Hargrave present , Hugill expressed that the Canadian Constitution did not give to the provinces sufficient powers to implement social credit , and that doing so would necessitate the use of the federal power over banking and currency . Hargrave , referring to Social Credit 's election promises to implement social credit , responded , \" surely the public ought to be told \" . After the meeting , Hargrave \u2014 by his account , at Aberhart 's request \u2014 prepared an eleven-point plan on implementing social credit in Alberta ; Aberhart rejected it , but the Social Credit caucus invited Hargrave to explain it . That meeting featured the following exchange between Hugill and Hargrave : Hugill : You realise , Mr. Hargrave , that this scheme you are putting forward would not be legal ? Hargrave : I am not interested in legal arguments.Hugill : What would you do if your legislation was disallowed and your parliament dissolved ? Hargrave : There is only one way in which such a government could be \" dissolved \" , and that is by sending in troops to throw it out , physically , neck and crop , down the steps of this parliament house . Does the Attorney-General suggest that any authority anywhere in Ottawa or elsewhere would , in those circumstances , march troops into Alberta ? Much of the caucus , frustrated by the government 's failure to implement social credit or even take tangible steps towards doing so , sided with Hargrave , and Hugill 's cabinet colleagues did not come to his defense . Hargrave 's presentation to Social Credit MLAs precipitated the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt , in which much of the Social Credit caucus threatened to bring down the government over its failure to introduce social credit . The revolt was muted with the creation of the Social Credit Board , which was to oversee the introduction of social credit . The first legislation recommended by the Social Credit Board included the Credit of Alberta Regulation Act , which provided for provincial licensing and supervision of banks , the Bank Employees Civil Rights Act , which prohibited unlicensed banks and their employees from instigating legal proceedings , and the Judicature Act , which prohibited challenges to the constitutionality of Alberta legislation . Hugill did not believe that the acts were within the province 's legislative competence , but avoided saying so publicly . In response to a question posed in the legislature on the province 's authority over banking , he said that he could not conclusively answer such an academic question , but referred the questioner to the British North America Act , 1867 . In a caucus meeting , in response to a request from Aberhart that he \" [ assure ] us that he feels in a position on every count to recommend that the Lieutenant-Governor gives his assent to every Social Credit Measure \" , Hugill was more open in his beliefs . On August 6 , 1937 , after the three acts were approved by the legislature , John Campbell Bowen , Lieutenant Governor of Alberta requested a meeting with Aberhart and Hugill before he granted royal assent to the legislation . He asked Hugill whether he considered the bills constitutional , and Hugill replied in the negative . Aberhart immediately said that he would take personal responsibility for the legislation 's constitutionality , and Bowen granted assent . In journalist John Barr 's telling , as Aberhart and Hugill left the meeting the premier said \" your resignation is accepted , Hugill \" , while according to Elliott and Miller he said only \" you know what this means , don 't you ? \" Whatever the words used , Hugill resigned later that afternoon . Historians have debated the propriety of Hugill 's actions in undercutting his own government 's legislation . Elliott and Miller believe that he could have refused to answer Bowen 's question , but that by not doing so he \" obeyed the letter of the Alberta law that set out his duties \" . They see his cabinet duties conflicting with his responsibility as a legal adviser , and that by giving Bowen his honest opinion he was upholding the oath he took as a barrister . Mallory disagrees , citing rules dating from 1882 stating that the Lieutenant Governor should use \u2014 or consider using \u2014 his powers of reservation only as a Dominion officer , and never on the advice of his ministers , including the Attorney General . He speculates that neither Bowen nor Hugill was aware of this rule , and criticizes the federal government for not monitoring the situation and advising Bowen as to the proper use of his power of reservation . = = = Post-resignation = = = Having left the government , Hugill also left the Social Credit caucus , and served the rest of his term as an independent . He joined the People 's League , a collection of all mainstream elements opposed to Aberhart which ran nominally independent candidates in the 1940 and 1944 elections , and denounced Aberhart 's government as a \" tyrannical dictatorship \" and the premier as the most sadistic man he had ever met . One of Hugill 's last acts as Attorney General had been attending a Toronto meeting of the Canadian Bar Association . In response to Hugill 's comments about his government , Aberhart refused reimbursement of Hugill 's expenses from that trip . Later , when Aberhart received word that Ryerson Press was going to publish an expose of his government authored by Hugill , he threatened to cancel Ryerson 's contracts to print Alberta 's school textbooks unless the company reconsidered . The expose was not published . = = Later life = = Hugill did not seek re-election at the conclusion of his term in 1940 , and returned to practicing law in Edmonton and Calgary . During the Second World War , he served on the mobilization board . He retired to Victoria in 1949 , the year after the death of his wife , and died there in 1971 .",

A Whig , Briggs served for twelve years in the United States House of Representatives , and served seven one-year terms as the 19th Governor of Massachusetts , from 1844 to 1851 . Raised in rural Upstate New York , Briggs studied law in western Massachusetts , where his civic involvement and successful legal practice preceded statewide political activity . He was elected to Congress in 1830 , where he supported the conservative Whig agenda , serving on the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads . He was also a regular advocate of temperance , abstaining from all alcohol consumption . He was nominated by the Whigs in 1843 to run against Democratic Governor Marcus Morton as part of a Whig bid for more rural votes , and easily won election until 1849 . Although he sought to avoid the contentious issue of slavery , he protested South Carolina policy allowing the imprisonment of free African Americans . He supported capital punishment , notably refusing to commute the death sentence of John White Webster for the murder of George Parkman . Briggs died of an accidental gunshot wound at his home in Pittsfield , Massachusetts . = = Early life and education = = George Nixon Briggs was born in Adams , Massachusetts on April 12 , 1796 . He was the eleventh of twelve children of Allen Briggs , a blacksmith originally from Cranston , Rhode Island , and Nancy ( Brown ) Briggs , of Huguenot descent . His parents moved the family to Manchester , Vermont when he was seven , and , two years later , to White Creek , New York . The household was religious : his father was a Baptist and his mother was a Quaker , and they gave their children religious instruction from the Bible . At the age of 14 , during the Second Great Awakening , which was especially strong in Upstate New York , Briggs experienced a conversion experience and joined the Baptist faith . He spoke at revival meetings of his experience , drawing appreciative applause from the crowds , according to Hiland Hall , who came to know Briggs at that time and who became a lifelong friend and political associate . His faith informed his personal behavior : he remained committed to religious ideals , for instance objecting to Congressional sessions that stretched into Sunday and abstaining from alcohol consumption . Briggs sporadically attended the public schools in White Creek , and was apprenticed for three years to a Quaker hatter . With support from his older brothers he embarked on the study of law in Pittsfield and Lanesboro in 1813 , and was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1818 . He first opened a practice in Adams , moved it to Lanesboro in 1823 , and Pittsfield in 1842 . His trial work was characterized by a contemporary as clear , brief , and methodical , even though he was fond of telling stories in less formal settings . In 1817 Briggs helped to establish a Baptist church in Lanesboro ; in this congregation he met Harriet Hall , whom he married in 1818 ; their children were Harriet , George , and Henry . Briggs was also called upon to raise the four orphaned children of his brother Rufus , one of the brothers who supported him in his law studies . Rufus died in 1816 , followed by his wife not long afterward . Briggs ' involvement in civic life began at the local level . From 1824 to 1831 Briggs was the register of deeds for the Northern district of Berkshire County , Massachusetts . He was elected town clerk in 1824 , was appointed chairman of the board of commissioners of highways in 1826 . His interest in politics was sparked by his acquaintance with Henry Shaw , who served in the United States House of Representatives from 1817 to 1821 . A criminal case tried in 1826 brought Briggs wider notice . An Oneida Indian living in Stockbridge was accused of murder . Briggs was appointed by the court to defend him ; convinced by the evidence that the man was innocent , Briggs made what was described by a contemporary as a plea that was \" a model of jury eloquence \" . The jury , unfortunately , disagreed with Briggs , and convicted the man , who was hanged . In 1830 the true murderer confessed to commission of the crime . = = U.S. House of Representatives = = Despite his rise in prominence , Briggs was at first ineligible for state offices because he did not own property . In 1830 he decided to run for Congress , for which there was no such requirement . He was elected to the twenty-second through the twenty-fourth Congresses as an Anti-Jacksonian , and as a Whig to the twenty-fifth through twenty-seventh Congresses , serving from March 4 , 1831 to March 3 , 1843 . He decided not to run for reelection in 1842 . Briggs was what became known in later years as a \" Cotton Whig \" . He was in favor of protectionist tariffs , and opposed the expansion of slavery into western territories , but did not seek to threaten the unity of the nation with a strong stance against slavery . He served on the Committee on Public Expenditures and the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads , serving for a time as the chairman of each . The Post Office committee was a regular recipient of complaints from southern states concerning the transmission of abolitionist mailings , which were seen there as incendiary ; the matter was of some controversy because southern legislators sought to have these types of mailings banned . Briggs ' friend Hiland Hall , who also sat on the committee , drafted a report in 1836 rebutting the rationales used in such legislative proposals , but the committee as a whole , and then the House , refused to accept the report . Although the authorship of the report appears to be entirely Hall 's , Briggs may have contributed to it , and was a signatory to Hall 's publication of the report in the National Intelligencer , a major political journal . The document was influential in driving later Congressional debate on legislative proposals concerning abolitionist mailings , none of which were ever adopted . Briggs and Hall were both instrumental in drafting and gaining passage of the Post Office Act of 1836 , which included substantive accounting reforms in the wake of financial mismanagement by Postmaster General William Taylor Barry . During his time in Congress , Briggs was a vocal advocate for temperance . He formed the Congressional Temperance Society in 1833 , sitting on its executive committee ; at an 1836 temperance convention at Saratoga Springs , New York he advocated the taking of total abstinence pledges as a way to bring more people away from the evils of alcohol , and notably prepared such a pledge for Kentucky Representative Thomas F. Marshall on the floor of the House of Representatives . His moves to organize the temperance movement in Congress died out when he left the body , but it was a cause he would continue to espouse for the rest of his life . In 1860 he was chosen president of the American Temperance Union . = = Governor of Massachusetts = = Briggs was nominated to run for the governorship on the Whig ticket against the incumbent Democrat Marcus Morton in 1843 . Former Governor John Davis had been nominated first , but refused the nomination , possibly because Daniel Webster promised him party support for a future vice presidential bid . Briggs was apparently recommended as a compromise candidate acceptable to different factions within the party ( one controlled by Webster , the other by Abbott Lawrence ) . He was also probably chosen to appeal more directly to the state 's rural voters , a constituency that normally supported Morton . The abolitionist Liberty Party also fielded a candidate , with the result that none of the candidates won the needed majority . The legislature decided the election in those cases ; with a Whig majority there , Briggs ' election was assured . Briggs was reelected annually until 1850 against a succession of Democratic opponents . He won popular majorities until the 1849 election , even though third parties ( including the Liberty Party and its successor , the Free Soil Party ) were often involved . Although Whigs had a reputation for aristocratic bearing , Briggs was much more a man of the people than the preceding Whig governors , John Davis and Edward Everett . In 1844 Briggs , alarmed at a recently enacted policy by South Carolina authorizing the imprisonment of free blacks arriving there from Massachusetts and other northern states , sent representatives to protest the policy . Samuel Hoar and his daughter Elizabeth were unsuccessful in changing South Carolina policy , and after protests against what was perceived as Yankee interference in Southern affairs , were advised to leave the state for their own safety . Capital punishment was a major issue that was debated in the state during Brigg 's tenure , with social reformers calling for its abolition . Briggs personally favored capital punishment , but for political reasons called for moderation in its use , seeking , for example , to limit its application in murder cases to those involving first degree murder . After an acquittal in an 1846 murder case where anti-death penalty sentiment was thought to have a role , Briggs , seeking to undercut the anti-death penalty lobby , proposed eliminating the penalty for all crimes except murder , but expressed concern that more such acquittals by sympathetic juries would undermine the connection between crime and punishment . Briggs ' argument was used in the 1849 trial of Washington Goode , a black mariner accused of killing a rival for the affections of a lady . The case against Goode was essentially circumstantial , but the jury heeded the district attorney 's call for assertive punishment of \" crimes of violence \" and convicted him . There were calls for Briggs to commute Goode 's capital sentence , but he refused , writing \" A pardon here would tend toward the utter subversion of the law . \" Not long after the Goode case came the sensational trial of Professor John White Webster in the murder of George Parkman , a crime that took place at the Harvard Medical School in November 1849 . The trial received nationwide coverage , and the prosecution case was based on evidence that was either circumstantial ( complicated by the fact that a complete corpse was not found ) , or founded on new types of evidence ( forensic dentistry was used for the first time in this trial ) . Furthermore , Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw was widely criticized for bias in the instructions he gave to the jury . Briggs was petitioned to commute Webster 's sentence by death penalty opponents , and even threatened with physical harm if he did not . He refused however , stating that the evidence in the case was clear ( especially after Webster gave a confession ) , and that there was no reason to doubt that the court had acted with due and proper diligence . During Briggs ' time as governor , abolitionist activists continued to make inroads against both the Whigs and Democrats , primarily making common cause with the Democrats against the dominant Whigs . Briggs ' stance as a Cotton Whig put him in opposition to these forces . He opposed the Mexican-American War , but acceded to federal demands that the states assist in raising troops for the war , earning the wrath of activist Wendell Phillips . He did promote other types of reform , supporting Horace Mann in his activities to improve education in the state . In 1849 , Briggs failed to secure a majority in the popular vote because of the rise in power of the Free Soil Party , but the Whig legislature returned him to office . In the 1850 election , anger over the Compromise of 1850 ( a series of federal acts designed to preserve the unity of the nation which included the Fugitive Slave Act ) prompted the Democrats and Free Soilers to form a coalition to gain control over the Massachusetts legislature , and divided the Whigs along pro- and antiabolition lines . With the gubernatorial election again sent to the legislature , Democrat George S. Boutwell was chosen over Briggs . = = Later years = = Briggs resumed the practice of law in Pittsfield . He was a member of the state constitutional convention in 1853 , and sat as a judge of the Court of Common Pleas from 1853 to 1858 . In 1859 he was nominated for governor by the fading Know-Nothing movement , but trailed far behind other candidates . In 1861 Briggs was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to a diplomatic mission to the South American Republic of New Granada ( roughly present-day Colombia and Panama ) . However , he died before he could take up the position . On September 4 , 1861 Briggs was getting an overcoat out of his closet at his home in Pittsfield , when a gun fell . As Briggs was picking it up , the gun discharged and Briggs was shot . Briggs died early in the morning of September 12 , 1861 , and was buried in the Pittsfield Cemetery .",

From 1974 to 1992 , he served as a member of the Charleston City Council . Originally involved in the civil rights movement , several of Ford 's public statements and legislative proposals as senator attracted media attention and controversy . He finished in third place in the June 2010 Democratic primary election for Governor of South Carolina . He resigned on May 31 , 2013 , in the midst of a political scandal on public funds spent in adult establishments . = = Personal life = = Ford was born in New Orleans , Louisiana ; his parents were leaders in the African American community . Ford attended Wayne State University and Grambling State University , from which he was expelled in 1969 before graduating for leading civil rights demonstrations . He was expelled by the university , despite it being historically black , because it relied on public funds which were controlled by a state government opposed to desegregation . Ford was a member of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference staff from 1966 to 1972 and worked for Martin Luther King , Jr. as a member of an advance team of the Poor People 's Campaign . He was arrested 73 times for participating in protests during the civil rights movement . In 1973 , he won a draft evasion trial on basis of conscientious objection . Ford worked as a car salesman and later became a full-time legislator . Ford is a lifelong bachelor . = = Political career = = Ford was elected to serve on the Charleston City Council , where he served from 1974 to 1992 , and ran for the State Senate and was elected on November 3 , 1992 , taking office in 1993 . He was reelected in 1996 , 2000 , 2004 , and 2008 . He served on the Senate Committees on Banking and Insurance , Corrections and Penology , General , Invitations , Judiciary , and Labor , Commerce and Industry , and was the ranking Democrat on several committees . Ford is a member of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus . Ford resigned on May 31 , 2013 during a brewing campaign finance scandal . Ford has been described as entertaining , controversial , and politically incorrect . He supported Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries and questioned Barack Obama 's appeal to white voters . Ford later apologized for his comments , stating that any Democrat could win and that he had supported other African American candidates for president in the past . Ford 's comments prompted a primary challenge in 2008 from Charleston lawyer Dwayne Green . In the beginning of his campaign , Green managed to raise double the amount of campaign funds Ford raised , and although Ford 's fundraising improved he for the first time attended a candidate forum to receive free publicity , because his campaign had financial difficulty resulting from the contested primary and a fire in his home . Green was defeated in the primary election by a wide margin . Ford praised Obama 's election in November 2008 , but criticized South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn 's family for allegedly attempting to profit off Obama 's victory . = = = Political positions = = = As senator , Ford has introduced many bills with only a small number becoming law , but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills . After becoming senator , Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House . It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag , and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination . Following years of debate , the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford . He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King , Jr . Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays . Ford stated that he hoped the legislation would improve race relations in South Carolina . Ford described the election of judges by popular vote as a major goal and supported increasing the number of judges . He supported giving more authority to law enforcement , including the ability to search people on parole and probation without warrant , making attempted murder a crime with lifelong sentence , and increasing penalties for possession of illegal guns . Ford is a proponent of stricter regulations of the financial industry . He sponsored a 2006 ban on payday lending , which was shown to discriminate against African Americans . In 2008 , Ford blocked all House bills in the Senate until the bill was taken up . The bill failed in the Senate by a close vote and was heavily amended so lenders would not be banned but restricted . The bill then passed with Ford voting in favor but failed to advance after changes made in the House . A bill preventing consumers from taking out more than one loan at a time passed the House in 2009 . Ford supported offshore drilling , stating conservation was not a priority for most citizens of the state . Geologists believe there is little oil to be found off the South Carolina coast . Ford wants to prevent the widening of Interstate 26 through Charleston , calling instead for a study for transportation needs . Ford emphasized the need for more funding for school programs , which he claimed is necessary due to the small number of pupils attending college and to remedy lacks of knowledge in geography and civics , which he wants reinstated as a school subject . Ford was told about favoritism , intimidation and racism in the South Carolina Highway Patrol and publicized it with Glenn McConnell . Subsequently , director and deputy director of the South Carolina Department of Public Safety resigned under pressure from governor Mark Sanford . Ford sponsored legislation defining a hate crime \" as an assault , intimidation or threat based on ' actual or perceived ' race , religion , color , sex , age , national origin and sexual orientation . \" He also introduced several bills concerning gay rights in lodging , hospital visitation rights and partnerships . His partnership bill would provide for civil unions in South Carolina . The effort was judged by state senator Mike Fair as predetermined to fail , but Ford cited the Democratic National Committee 's platform on the issue and argued that Barack Obama 's election showed that a change should be attempted . Even if passed , the measure would be unenforceable , due to a constitutional amendment banning unions similar to marriage in South Carolina . Ford worked to outlaw profanity and saggy pants and to keep music from minors that is \" profane , vulgar , lewd , lascivious or indecent . \" Ford argued he did not expect these proposals to be approved but wanted to start a discussion specifically targeting young African American men 's fashion as well as rap music . He stated : \" You don 't have to emulate prisoners no more . You can emulate somebody like Barack Obama . \" Ford often opposed governor Mark Sanford 's political goals , arguing his proposed reforms were unwanted by the public , and he mostly opposed Sanford 's fiscal policy and worked to override budget vetoes by the governor , claiming he was removed from the interests of citizens . An exception were security measures for the State House complex which Ford agreed were too costly . He also opposed Sanford 's goal to increase the number of roll calls in the State Senate and voted against a 2008 immigration reform bill favored by Sanford , stating it would be an ineffective deterrent and would lead to less driving safety . The reform would have required all employers to use state driver 's licenses or a database from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to check the legal status of workers . Ford co-sponsored a bill with Glenn McConnell that would limit the governor 's authority to appoint and remove board members overseeing the Charleston port and increase required qualifications for board members . Ford opposed a bill giving Sanford authority over the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control . = = 2010 Gubernatorial candidacy = = Ford ran to succeed Mark Sanford as Governor of South Carolina in the 2010 gubernatorial election . His platform included reinstating video poker to the state to generate returns from taxes on the gaming industry in an effort to balance the state budget , something he has proposed since the late 1990s . A law Ford sponsored in 2008 to make gambling legal failed to advance ; he planned a voter referendum to repeal the ban . Ford faced state senator Vincent A. Sheheen of Camden and State Superintendent of Education Jim Rex in a primary election . Sheheen 's campaign has raised $ 33,000 as of January 2009 , while Ford 's campaign raised $ 6,000 . On June 8 , 2010 , Ford finished in third place in the primary election with 18 percent of the vote . = = Electoral history = = South Carolina State Senator , 42nd Senatorial District , 1992 Primary election , August 25 , 1992 Threshold > 50 % Ford won the general election unopposed on November 3 , 1992 .

                    "text": "Gabriel Slaughter = Gabriel Slaughter ( December 12 , 1767 \u2013 September 19 , 1830 ) was the seventh Governor of Kentucky and was the first person to ascend to that office upon the death of the sitting governor . His family moved to Kentucky from Virginia when he was very young . He became a member of the Kentucky militia , serving throughout his political career . He received a citation from the state legislature in recognition of his service at the Battle of New Orleans . After spending a decade in the state legislature , Slaughter was elected the fourth Lieutenant Governor , serving under Charles Scott . With the War of 1812 looming at the end of his tenure , Slaughter ran for governor against Isaac Shelby , the state 's first governor and a noted military leader . Shelby beat Slaughter soundly . Four years later , Slaughter was again elected as lieutenant governor , serving under George Madison . Madison died a short time into his term , whereupon Slaughter became acting governor . He sought to be sworn in as governor , but public sentiment turned against him when he replaced Shelby 's son-in-law with John Pope as Secretary of State . Pope was an unpopular figure in Kentucky and , after his appointment , some in the General Assembly began to call for a special election to replace Slaughter . The measure did not pass , but Slaughter was never able to shed the title of \" acting governor . \" Following his term as governor , Slaughter became a Baptist lay minister and served on the first board of trustees of Georgetown College . He died September 19 , 1830 and was buried in his family 's cemetery . = = Early life = = Gabriel Slaughter was born in Culpeper County , Virginia on December 12 , 1767 , the son of Robert and Susannah ( Harrison ) Slaughter . He was educated in the county 's public schools and worked as a farmer . In 1786 , Slaughter married a cousin , Sarah Slaughter , and the couple had two daughters \u2013 Mary Buckner Slaughter and Susan Harrison Slaughter . Slaughter 's father visited Kentucky as early as 1776 , and moved to Mercer County permanently in 1789 . In September 1791 , Gabriel Slaughter sold his land in Virginia , and he and his family followed his father to Kentucky . He became known for his generosity , and his large mansion on the turnpike to Lexington was nicknamed \" Wayfarer 's Rest \" because of the vast number of travelers that he allowed to stay there . Among his guests was future lieutenant governor Robert B. McAfee . Soon after his arrival in Kentucky , however , his wife Sarah died , leaving Slaughter to care for his two daughters alone . In 1795 , Slaughter was appointed justice of the peace in Mercer County by Governor Isaac Shelby . The same year , he was also named a tax commissioner for a district of Mercer County . On a return trip to Virginia in 1797 , Slaughter married his second wife , Sara Hord . The couple returned to Slaughter 's home in Mercer County , where they had three children : John Hord Slaughter , Frances Ann Hord Slaughter , and Felix Grundy Slaughter . = = Service in the Kentucky General Assembly = = Slaughter 's political career began in earnest with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County . He was named to the Committee on Enrollments , and probably served as chair , since he delivered the committee 's reports to the Assembly . It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798 , or whether he was defeated in that year 's canvass . Whatever the case , he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy . He was re-elected to the state House in 1799 . In addition to the Committee on Enrollments , he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported on the state of the Auditor 's , Treasurer 's , and Registrar 's offices . Records show that he also served as chairman when the House sat as a committee of the whole on November 25 , 1799 . Slaughter was re-elected to the state House in 1800 , and from 1801 to 1808 he served in the Kentucky Senate . In 1801 , he was chosen as one of three commissioners from Mercer County charged with selling stock shares in the Kentucky River Company , which was chartered to clear obstructions in the Kentucky River from its mouth to the mouth of its south fork . In 1804 , he was a candidate for President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate following the death of the Senate 's presiding officer , Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell . Ultimately , however , Thomas Posey proved the more popular choice . From 1807 to 1808 , he served as chair of the Senate Committee of Propositions and Grievances . Slaughter was elected lieutenant governor in 1808 . In a four-man race , he received more than three times the number of votes as his nearest opponent . His four-year term under Governor Charles Scott was largely undistinguished . Although the exact date is unknown , it is likely that the death of Slaughter 's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor . On October 3 , 1811 , he married his third wife , Elizabeth ( Thompson ) Rodes , a widow from Scott County . Prohibited by the Kentucky Constitution from succeeding himself as lieutenant governor , Slaughter ran for governor of Kentucky in 1812 . The impending war with England , however , drew military hero and former governor Isaac Shelby into the race . Despite Shelby 's immense popularity , Slaughter refused to withdraw from the race and was soundly beaten by more than a two-to-one margin . Following his defeat , Slaughter took a two-year hiatus from public life , and engaged in farming at his estate in Mercer County . = = Service in the state militia = = Slaughter had been commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the Fifth Regiment of the Kentucky militia on December 24 , 1803 . He was promoted to the rank of major in 1802 and colonel in 1803 . In 1814 , he answered Governor Shelby 's call for volunteers to serve in the army of the Southwest under General Andrew Jackson . When the Quartermaster general did not deliver promised supplies to Slaughter 's regiment , private funds had to be used to purchase boats for their travel down the Mississippi River . They also ran short of weapons . Upon their arrival at New Orleans on January 4 , 1815 , General Jackson noted in his official report that \" Not one man in ten was well armed , and only one man in three had any arms at all . \" The citizens of New Orleans provided enough firearms to equip the rest of Slaughter 's men and another Kentucky battalion . Despite being vastly outnumbered , Jackson 's forces were victorious . Units from Kentucky and Tennessee , including Slaughter 's regiment , bore the brunt of the British attack . Slaughter was later recognized by the state legislature for his service . Following their service together , Jackson asked Slaughter to preside over a court martial . When the verdict was not satisfactory to Jackson , he ordered Slaughter to reconsider and reverse the decision . Slaughter declined , replying \" I know my duty , and have performed it . \" This decision was respected by Jackson , and apparently did no harm to the mutual respect between him and Slaughter . = = Ascension to the governorship = = In 1816 , Slaughter was again elected to the post of lieutenant governor over Richard Hickman and James Garrard . George Madison was elected governor without opposition . Madison died October 14 , 1816 , and Slaughter ascended to the governorship . This was the first time a sitting governor had died in office in Kentucky , and some questioned the legality of Slaughter 's status in the position . Following Governor Madison 's death , Secretary of State Charles Stewart Todd offered to step down if Slaughter preferred to appoint someone else to the post . The letter was not an explicit resignation , as Todd emphatically declared his intention to work with Slaughter should the governor choose to retain him . Slaughter did replace Todd with former Senator John Pope , however , apparently as a political favor . This move proved disastrous for Slaughter 's political career . Todd was very popular by virtue of being the son-in-law of twice-governor Shelby . By contrast , Pope was extremely unpopular for his vote in the U.S. Senate against declaring war in the War of 1812 . The move was panned in the state 's newspapers , and by prominent citizens such as future governor James Turner Morehead . Yet Slaughter followed up with another unpopular decision , appointing Martin D. Hardin , a member of the hated Federalist Party , to fill the Senate seat of William T. Barry . Despite this , the General Assembly made the appointment permanent when it convened in December 1816 . However , the administration candidate for a full senatorial term , John Adair was defeated in the General Assembly , which opted for John J. Crittenden . On January 27 , 1817 , a faction in the Kentucky House of Representatives led by Joseph Cabell Breckinridge proposed a bill calling for the election of \" a governor to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of \" Governor Madison . The measure failed , but the legislative elections of 1817 showed a popular mandate for a special gubernatorial election . The Kentucky House passed a bill calling for such elections by a vote of 56 \u2013 30 , but the measure died in the state senate . Nevertheless , Slaughter was never officially given the title of governor and was referred to as \" lieutenant governor \" or \" acting governor \" throughout his administration . The General Assembly censured both Slaughter and Pope for failing to require the proper security and oath of office for the state treasurer . Slaughter 's unpopularity led to the demise of many of his proposals , regardless of their merits . He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and , though the idea had been proposed by previous governors , Slaughter devised a means of funding it . The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter 's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries . Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements , including the creation of a state library . These measures were also rejected . Slaughter 's governorship was further complicated by the financial panic of 1819 , and he spent the majority of his term working to stabilize that state 's economy . Politicians of the day generally divided into those who favored measures favorable to debtors \u2013 called the \" relief \" position or party \u2013 and those who insisted that creditors be paid in a timely manner \u2013 called the \" anti-relief \" position or party . On December 16 , 1819 , the General Assembly passed a law requiring a six-month moratorium on the collection of debts . Slaughter , an anti-relief partisan , vetoed the bill , but relief party legislators held a large majority in the General Assembly thanks to the previous fall 's elections , and overrode the veto . The following February , the General Assembly passed an even more liberal stay law , preventing the collection of debts for one year if the creditor would accept payments in the devalued notes of the Bank of Kentucky and two years if they demanded payment in specie or specie-backed notes . These actions were a precursor to the Old Court-New Court controversy . While Slaughter clashed with the General Assembly over potential solutions to the crisis at the state level , he adopted a strong states ' rights policy at the national level . He challenged the constitutionality of the Bank of the United States and the Supreme Court 's ruling that individual states could not tax branches of the Bank . = = Religious leadership and later life = = Following his term as governor , Slaughter failed in a bid to return to the state senate in 1821 , but was re-elected to the state House of Representatives in 1823 , serving a single term . During this term , he continued to support measures to improve education . He voted to ask Congress for aid for the Deaf and Dumb School in the state , and opposed redirecting fines and forfeitures earmarked for the state 's \" Seminaries of Learning \" into the state treasury . He was also named to a joint committee to investigate the use of state appropriations to Transylvania University . Concurrent with his political career , Slaughter took a leading role in the affairs of his church . He was born into the tradition of the Church of England , but soon became associated with the Baptist congregation at Shawnee Run . He served as a messenger from this congregation to the various associations with which it was connected for over thirty years . One such association was the South District Association ; Slaughter served as clerk at that body 's annual meeting in 1808 and 1809 , and later served as its moderator for nine years . In 1813 , he helped found the Kentucky Bible Society . Following his term in the state House , Slaughter retired from politics and became an active lay minister of the Baptist faith . In 1829 , he was appointed to the first board of trustees of Georgetown College , a Baptist college in Georgetown , Kentucky . He died on September 19 , 1830 , and was interred in his family 's cemetery in Mercer County .",

                    "text": "Harry Toulmin ( Unitarian minister ) = Harry Toulmin ( sometimes called Henry Toulmin ) ( April 7 , 1766 \u2013 November 11 , 1823 ) was a Unitarian minister and politician . The son of noted Dissenting minister Joshua Toulmin , Toulmin fled his native England for the United States after he and his followers were persecuted for their beliefs . He arrived in Virginia in 1793 , and aided by recommendations from Thomas Jefferson and James Monroe , he was chosen president of Transylvania Seminary ( now Transylvania University ) in Lexington , Kentucky . His Unitarian views , however , offended many of the orthodox Presbyterian members of Transylvania 's board of regents , and Toulmin resigned after two years . Shortly after his resignation , Toulmin was appointed Secretary of State of Kentucky by Governor James Garrard . He influenced Garrard \u2013 a Baptist minister \u2013 to adopt some doctrines of Socinianism , for which he was expelled from the local Baptist association , ending his ministry . As Secretary of State , Toulmin endorsed the Kentucky Resolutions and revised the state 's code of laws in conjunction with Attorney General James Blair . After the expiration of his term as Secretary of State in 1804 , Thomas Jefferson appointed him Superior Court Judge for the Tombigbee District of the Mississippi Territory . He was the first U.S. district judge to hold court on Alabama soil . As the highest-ranking authority in the large territory , he tried to prevent residents in his jurisdiction from conducting raids against the Spanish in West Florida and from participating in the Creek War between two rival factions of Creek Indians . When the state of Alabama was formed from part of Toulmin 's district , he helped write the new state 's constitution and was elected to the state legislature . Again , he was asked to compile a digest of the region 's laws , which he completed in 1823 . Toulmin died in Washington County , Alabama on November 11 , 1823 . Because of his work compiling the laws of several states , later historians called him the \" frontier Justinian \" . His grandson , Harry Theophilus Toulmin was appointed district judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama by President Grover Cleveland in 1886 . In 2005 , Toulmin was inducted into the Alabama Lawyer 's Hall of Fame , and in December 2009 he was honored with the installation of a plaque in front of the Baldwin County , Alabama , courthouse . = = Early life and family = = Toulmin was born April 7 , 1766 , in Taunton , Somersetshire , England . His parents were Joshua Toulmin , a noted Dissenting minister , and his wife Jane ( Smith ) Toulmin . He received little formal education , but frequently read books in his mother 's bookstore and benefited from listening to conversations between his father and other noted ministers such as Joseph Priestley and Theophilus Lindsey . After attending Hoxton Academy and studying under Thomas Barnes and William Hawes , he followed his father into the ministry in 1786 . During his ministry in England , Toulmin served two Dissenting congregations in Lancashire . From 1786 to 1788 , he was pastor of a church in Monton , and from 1787 to 1793 , he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton . He soon had nearly 1,000 followers , Many of his followers supported the French Revolution , attracting the attention of anti-dissenting partisans in England . A group of these partisans once took advantage of Toulmin 's absence to threaten his house , necessitating his swift return to protect his family . Upon arriving , he was able to break up the mob via diplomacy alone . About 1787 , Toulmin married Ann Tremlett . The couple had nine children , five of whom survived infancy . In 1808 , one of these children , Lucinda Jane , married Colonel Daniel Garrard , the son of James Garrard , the second governor of Kentucky . After the death of Toulmin 's first wife , he married Martha Johnson in 1812 . They had one child together . = = Resettlement in Kentucky = = Spurred by the persecution endured by his followers and himself , in 1792 Toulmin published an anonymous pamphlet entitled \" Thoughts on Emigration \" , containing his thoughts on members of the Dissenter movement relocating to another country . The following year , his congregants raised enough money to send him to the United States to explore the possibility of relocating there . Dr. Priestly gave him letters of introduction to Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to present on his arrival . During his two-month voyage from England to Norfolk , Virginia , Toulmin kept a diary , which was later published under the title The Western Country in 1793 ; Reports on Kentucky and Virginia . Following his arrival in the United States , Toulmin wrote letters back to England , giving potential immigrants information they would need to know for their journey ; these letters were published in the local Monthly Magazine . The following year , he published A Description of Kentucky , a pamphlet encouraging emigration from Europe to Kentucky . After seeing Toulmin 's letters of recommendation from Jefferson and Madison , the board of trustees of Transylvania Seminary ( now Transylvania University ) in Lexington , Kentucky , elected him president of the seminary in February 1794 . He was the first president of the seminary who was not a Presbyterian , and his election was effected when the Baptist and more liberal members of the board united against the more conservative Presbyterian members . His Unitarian views offended many of the conservative board members , and at their insistence , the Kentucky General Assembly passed legislation requiring a unanimous vote of the board of regents to re-elect the seminary 's president . Toulmin resigned in protest in April 1796 . Shortly after Toulmin 's resignation , James Garrard , a Baptist minister who had supported Toulmin as a trustee of Transylvania , was elected governor of Kentucky . At first , Garrard elected to re-appoint sitting Secretary of State James Brown , but when Brown retired in October 1796 , Garrard appointed Toulmin as his replacement . He served in this capacity from 1796 to 1804 , spanning both of Garrard 's consecutive terms as governor . As a result of Garrard 's relationship with Toulmin , he began to accept some tenets of Unitarianism , specifically the doctrines of Socinianism . By 1802 , Garrard and his associate Augustine Eastin had not only adopted these beliefs , but had indoctrinated their Baptist congregations with them as well . The Elkhorn Baptist Association condemned Garrard and Eastin 's beliefs as heretical and tried to persuade the two men to abandon them . When that effort failed , the Association ceased correspondence and association with both men . This event ended Garrard 's ministry and his association with the Baptist church . As Secretary of State , Toulmin was signatory to the Kentucky Resolutions , the legislature 's official protest of the Alien and Sedition Acts , which he regarded as an \" unwarranted government intrusion into free thought , free association , and free speech \" . In 1801 , he published The Magistrate 's Assistant , a guide to the state 's magisterial laws . He also promoted public awareness of governmental activity by compiling and publishing the proceedings of the General Assembly as The Public Acts of the General Assembly . Government officials chose Toulmin and state Attorney General James Blair to revise the state 's code of laws . The results of their work \u2013 a three-volume tome entitled Review of the Criminal Law of Kentucky \u2013 was published in 1806 . Near the end of Governor Garrard 's term , he appointed Toulmin registrar of the state land office . Toulmin was the first of six candidates that the state senate rejected in a bitter showdown between Garrard and the legislature . The seventh candidate , John Adair was finally confirmed by the senate . = = Life in Alabama = = Toulmin supported President Thomas Jefferson 's re-election bid in 1804 . Following his victory , Jefferson appointed Toulmin to succeed Ephraim Kirby as Superior Court Judge for the Tombigbee District of the Mississippi Territory in 1804 . Because Kirby only served six months and never held court in the present-day state of Alabama , Toulmin is regarded as the first U.S. federal judge on Alabama soil . Toulmin and his family relocated to Fort Stoddert , just north of the border between the United States and the Spanish territory of West Florida . Toulmin 's district was large \u2013 by his estimate , 340 miles long and 330 miles wide \u2013 and he served as minister , physician , judge , postmaster , and diplomat for the area . He published both the Mississippi Magistrate 's Guide and The Laws of Mississippi in 1807 . The residents of Tombigbee District objected to Spanish control of Mobile Bay , which prevented them from accessing the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans . In 1805 , he formally petitioned Congress to intervene , but they did not . Although he personally favored U.S. annexation of West Florida , he defended it as an independent nation until the annexation occurred . In 1807 , he arrested former Vice-President Aaron Burr ; Burr had been accused of conspiring to create an independent state in the Southwest that would belong to neither the U.S. nor Spain . In 1810 , he arrested Reuben Kemper and two other members of a group styled the \" Mobile Society \" following an unsuccessful attempt to \" liberate \" Mobile and Pensacola . Toulmin 's actions were seen as supportive of Spain , and a Baldwin County grand jury charged him with acting on behalf of Spain . A congressional investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing in May 1812 . Toulmin was less successful in preventing residents of his district from entering the Creek War between to rival factions of Creek Indians . In 1817 , Alabama Territory was formed from part of Mississippi Territory . When the state of Alabama was created from part of the Tombigbee District in 1819 , Toulmin was chosen to represent Baldwin County at the state 's constitutional convention in July 1819 . He served on the Committee of Fifteen that drafted the first Constitution of Alabama . The document was influenced by the Kentucky Constitution of 1800 , which contained more democratic provisions than some of the older state constitutions . After the constitutional convention , he was elected to the Alabama Legislature . In 1821 , his fellow legislators chose him to write a digest of the state 's laws . The final product , Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama , was published in 1823 . It comprised over 1,000 pages and contained the laws of Mississippi and Alabama territories as well as the acts passed by the Alabama Legislature to date . Toulmin maintained a cotton plantation in Washington County , Alabama . Although he was opposed to slavery when initially arriving in the United States , and he advocated for provisions in the Alabama Constitution that permitted the eventual emancipation of slaves , nevertheless he eventually came to be a slave owner himself . In his will , he provided for one of his slaves to be freed , deeming him \" fit for freedom which few negroes are . \" = = Death and legacy = = Toulmin died on his plantation on November 11 , 1823 . He is presumed to have been buried on his plantation , but the exact location of his grave is unknown . Because of his work in codifying the laws of several states and territories , later literary scholars referred to Toulmin as the \" frontier Justinian \" , an allusion to Byzantine Emperor Justinian I , who was known for codifying the empire 's laws . One of Toulmin 's sons became a prominent state legislator in Alabama , and his grandson , Harry Theophilus Toulmin was appointed district judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama by President Grover Cleveland in 1886 . The original Judge Toulmin was elected to the Alabama Lawyer 's Hall of Fame in 2005 .

The men were opponents of the Social Credit government of Premier William Aberhart , which had been elected on a platform of giving all Albertans monthly dividends ; Aberhart blamed the banking system for his failure to follow through on this pledge . After David Duggan , leader of the Conservative Party and one of the men named , raised his concern over the pamphlet in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta , police raided the Social Credit League 's Edmonton headquarters . Social Credit whip Joe Unwin and Social Credit Board advisor George Frederick Powell were arrested and charged with criminal libel and counselling to murder . Both were convicted of the libel charge , and Justice William Carlos Ives sentenced them to hard labour . = = Background = = William Aberhart 's Social Credit League won a substantial victory in the 1935 Alberta provincial election on the strength of its promise to implement social credit , an economic theory proposed by British engineer C. H. Douglas . Social credit held that the poverty of the Great Depression was in part the fault of bankers , who kept the cost of credit , and by extension of production , high . Aberhart 's solution involved , among other things , monthly \" credit dividends \" to Albertans in the amount of C $ 25 . By 1937 , Aberhart 's failure to implement these dividends or make other progress towards implementing social credit made many of his backbenchers suspect that he was either unwilling or unable to do so . This belief , combined with a suspicion that he did not properly understand Douglas 's theories , led to the 1937 Social Credit backbenchers ' revolt . One outcome of the revolt was Aberhart 's ceding a number of the government 's powers to the Social Credit Board , made up of five Social Credit backbenchers . Glenville MacLachlan , its chair , travelled to the United Kingdom , where he asked Douglas to come to Alberta and serve as its advisor . Douglas declined , but in his stead sent two of his lieutenants , L. D. Byrne and George Frederick Powell . Part of the Board 's mandate was to educate the public about social credit ; to this end , Powell and Social Credit whip Joseph Unwin were assigned to write educational materials . In response to what they saw as the radically anti-business views of the Aberhart government and the Social Credit Board , Alberta 's mainstream opposition parties \u2014 chiefly the Liberals and the Conservatives \u2014 began to cooperate under the auspices of the newly formed People 's League . = = Leaflet = = In October 1937 , Conservative leader David Duggan rose in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta to draw its attention to a pamphlet distributed in and around the legislature building that called for his \" extermination \" . The front of the leaflet read as follows : My child , you should NEVER say hard or unkind things about Bankers ' Toadies . God made snakes , slugs , snails and other creepy-crawly , treacherous , and poisonous things . NEVER , therefore , abuse them \u2014 just exterminate them ! And to prevent all evasion demand the RESULT you want \u2014 $ 25.00 a month and a lower cost to live . The back of the pamphlet listed nine men identified as \" toadies \" . Besides Duggan , they were S. W. Field , lawyer and president of the People 's League H. H. Parlee , lawyer and president of the Liberals ' Edmonton constituency association John Lymburn , lawyer , member of the People 's League , and former Attorney-General of Alberta H. R. Milner , lawyer and president of the Conservatives ' Edmonton constituency association G. D. Hunt , investment broker L. Y. Cairns , lawyer , member of the Conservatives ' provincial executive G. W. Auxier , lawyer and secretary of the People 's League William Antrobus Griesbach , lawyer , member of the Canadian Senate , and former member of the Canadian House of Commons and mayor of Edmonton Below this list of names were the words \" Exterminate Them . And to prevent all Evasion , Demand the Result You Want \u2014 $ 25.00 a MONTH and a lower cost to live . \" On October 3 , the police raided the Social Credit League 's Edmonton office and seized 4,000 copies of the pamphlet . Griesbach pressed charges against Powell and Unwin for criminal libel and counselling to murder . = = Trial = = Aberhart , who besides being Premier was Attorney-General , tried to prevent the trial from proceeding by withdrawing the Crown prosecutor assigned to it . Either trial judge William Carlos Ives or a justice of the peace countered by appointing a private prosecutor so the case could go ahead . Both defendants were held on $ 20,000 bail . Both hired lawyers : Powell was represented by Hugh Calais Macdonald , while Unwin retained one R. Jackson . George Steer acted for the prosecution . On October 27 , both men appeared before police magistrate A. H. Gibson for their preliminary hearings on the criminal libel charge ( the counselling to murder charge had been dropped ) . Unwin opted for a jury trial , while Powell elected to be tried by a judge alone . Unwin 's trial proceeded first , on November 12 . He testified that he had ordered the pamphlets , which were paid for by the government , and then circulated them as a publication of the \" United Democrats \" , a fictitious organization that listed its address as that of Unwin 's home . According to Unwin , the leaflet 's text , minus the named individuals , had been provided to him by Powell , he had sent it to the printer 's in exactly that form , and he was surprised to see the list of names in the final version . Though his testimony was vague and apparently evasive , he admitted to destroying 4,000 copies of the leaflet on the day of the police raid . He was convicted and Ives , dismissing his role in the affair as that of an \" errand boy \" , sentenced him to three months hard labour . Powell 's trial proceeded immediately after Unwin 's , and his testimony contradicted much of what Unwin had said . Powell claimed that Unwin had put the list of names on the pamphlet , and that Powell had expected that it would list organizations rather than individuals . Ives found Unwin 's testimony more credible , convicted Powell on November 15 , and sentenced him to six months hard labour . He also recommended that he be deported to his native United Kingdom following his sentence . Appeals by both men against conviction and sentence were unsuccessful . = = Aftermath = = The case attracted considerable media attention and mixed reactions . A Toronto spokesman for the Communist Party of Canada protested the arrests and called for a \" united front \" against the People 's League . Aberhart maintained that the men had been jailed on the basis of some harmless political humour , and encouraged the federal government to grant them clemency ; Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King responded that to do so would be to engage in \" direct interference by the federal executive with the free and proper functioning of our courts \" . Every night , some Social Crediters drove to the Fort Saskatchewan Penitentiary , where the men were being held , to show their support . On February 11 , 1938 , the legislature passed a resolution calling for the men 's release . Douglas reacted to his deputy 's arrest with anger , telling reporters that \" whoever is instigating the proceedings is asking for a great deal of trouble , and is likely to get it . \" On December 10 , 1937 , he wrote King to tell him that he had been invited to come to Alberta to provide advice , and asked if he would be risking arrest and deportation if he did so . King responded that as long as Douglas , unlike Powell , refrained from running afoul of the Criminal Code , he had nothing to fear . At the end of Unwin 's sentence , the Social Credit members of the legislature celebrated with a snake dance . Powell was released early , on March 21 , 1938 , in an attempt by King to bolster his Liberals ' chances in a by-election in Edmonton East the same day ; the by-election was won by Social Crediter Orvis A. Kennedy , and a jubilant celebration followed . Once again , the Communists expressed solidarity with the Social Crediters , with Jan Lakeman thanking the voters for giving \" an overwhelming defeat to the forces of reaction \" . Powell left Canada immediately upon his release , but not before being paid $ 4,000 by the Alberta government as thanks for his services . On August 18 , 1938 , police magistrate A. H. Gibson , who had presided over the prosecution of Unwin and Powell , was dismissed without cause by provincial Order in Council . Gibson believed that his dismissal was due to \" the government 's resentment over my action in the Powell-Unwin case and the fact that they hold me more or less to blame for the fact that the accused men were sent to jail . \" Aberhart 's Social Crediters were re-elected with a reduced majority in the 1940 provincial election ; Aberhart remained premier until his 1943 death . Unwin was defeated in 1940 by Labour candidate Angus James Morrison . Though he lived until January 4 , 1987 , Unwin remains most remembered for his involvement in the Bankers ' Toadies incident .",

                    "text": "Nation Alliance Party = The Nation Alliance Party was a minor political party in British Columbia , Canada . While the party was registered with Elections BC as a provincial party , it also participated in the 2008 federal election , the 2008 municipal election , as well as the 2009 provincial election . The party sought to promote multiculturalism , advocate for rights of ethnic minorities and recent immigrants focusing on employment access , security , health care , education and overall rights and status . It was an advocacy party that sought to politically empower and enable those who do not speak English as a first language to participate in politics . Led by Wei Ping Chen , the party was founded in June 2007 . Chen stood for election in Richmond in the October 2008 federal election , and for mayor of Richmond , British Columbia in the November 2008 municipal election , losing both times . In the May 2009 provincial election the party nominated two candidates , one in Richmond Centre and the other in Richmond East , neither of whom were elected but combined for 818 total votes . = = Background = = The Nation Alliance Party was founded in June 2007 by four people : realtor Wei Ping Chen of Delta , renovator Steven Lian from Surrey , tourism guide Randy Liu from Burnaby , and Simon Fraser University student Locan Wang . Party leader Wei Ping Chen had immigrated to Canada from Beijing , via Australia . He witnessed the challenges that recent immigrants faced once in a new country , and how uninvolved they were in politics . Contrasted to his experience in China , Wei Ping Chen was impressed with the political freedoms available in Canada and felt motivated to start a political party . He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English , would empower those communities to become more politically active . Wei Ping Chen was a candidate in the October 2008 federal election in the Richmond electoral district . However , because the party was not registered with Elections Canada , he ran as an independent . He came in fifth place , with 397 votes ( 0.93 % ) , losing to the Conservative Party 's Alice Wong . In November 2008 , Nation Alliance Party members nominated candidates for the municipal election in Richmond . Wei Ping Chen challenged incumbent Malcolm Brodie for the mayoral position and Kang Chen , Yang Dai , Jiajian Cheung , Jian Liu , and Bai Chen were nominated for councillor positions . Like the federal campaign , they were classified as independents . The latest census at the time reported that 50 % of Richmond 's population was of Chinese descent and their campaign highlighted the language barrier faced by those who did not speak English , for example tax notices were only available in English . They participated in the all-candidate forums that were translated in Cantonese and Mandarin . None of its candidates were elected with Wei Ping Chen receiving 7 % of the vote . = = Political positions = = The Nation Alliance Party was guided by a support for multiculturalism . Specifically , the party sought to increase translation services for people who could not read or speak English or people whose first language is not English , equivalency of academic standards , more supportive immigration services that assist transition into Canadian society , and better working conditions for recent immigrants and migrant labourers . While the party did not maintain a full slate of policy positions , its candidates advocated for increasing the number of police in Richmond , especially along the SkyTrain route , protection of green spaces , support for affordable housing , and trade missions with China . They were generally in favour of lower taxes but with more spending on senior services and education . In the 2009 provincial election they campaigned against the carbon tax which the governing BC Liberal Party had implemented the previous year . = = Election results = = In the 2009 provincial election , the party nominated candidates in two ridings . Wei Ping Chen stood in the Richmond East riding but got only 419 votes ( 2.27 % ) , coming in last place , losing to BC Liberal Linda Reid . In Richmond Centre , the Nation Alliance Party candidate was Kang Chen . He came in last with 399 votes ( 2.33 % ) , losing to BC Liberal Rob Howard . The party de-registered with Elections BC in May 2012 , one year prior to the next election , scheduled for May 2013 . = = Finances = = In 2009 provincial election both candidates only reported $ 250 worth of expenditures to Elections BC . In that same election the party claimed $ 318 in general election expenditures .",

                    "text": "Patio 29 = Patio 29 is a common grave in Santiago General Cemetery in Chile , where political prisoners , especially those who \" disappeared \" during the 1973 Chilean coup d '\u00e9tat , were buried anonymously . The mass grave , the largest of Augusto Pinochet 's military government , was used for unannounced and unmarked burials in the 1970s until an anonymous tip alerted the public to its usage . With the return of democracy to Chile in 1991 , an exhumation effort through 2006 recovered 126 bodies in 105 graves and identified three-quarters of the victims . A 2005 DNA test later reported widespread identification errors and a new identification database began in 2007 . Exhumation authorities report that the site has been fully exhumed , which families of the victims contest . The burial grounds became Chile 's first cemetery to be designated a protected national monument in 2006 . The site serves as a symbol for the human rights movement and the 1973 coup 's disappeared . As such , Patio 29 became part of the Bachelet government 's \" symbolic reparation \" program . Annual marches against the coup end at the site . = = History = = In 1973 a military coup overthrew the socialist Chilean government and replaced it with a military dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet , the Commander-in-Chief of the Chilean Army . The military rule was characterized by systematic suppression of all political dissidence . The worst violence occurred within the first three months of the coup , with the number of suspected dissidents killed or \" disappeared \" reaching several thousand . In 1979 , the Vicariate of Solidarity , the Catholic Church 's human rights office , received information regarding illegal burials of six victims from Paine , Chile in a section of Santiago 's main cemetery , known as Patio 29 ; this led to a court investigation which revealed that Patio 29 had been used to anonymously bury the unmarked bodies of executed political prisoners between 1970 and 1980 , especially those kidnapped during the 1973 coup . In 1981 , Santiago 's military prosecutor prohibited the unmarked bodies from being incinerated or removed , though Walkowitz and Knauer wrote in Memory and the Impact of Political Transformation in Public Space that the military government dug up and hid hundreds of these bodies in 1982 . Following the end of military rule and return of democracy to Chile in 1990 , investigation of human rights violations became a top priority . Though a 1978 amnesty decree prevented prosecution for pre-1978 offenses , the new Aylwin government sought disclosure of the truth and recompense for the victim 's families and appointed a National Commission for Truth and Reconciliation . The commission 's February 1991 Rettig Report named victims disappeared shortly after the coup , executed by gunshot , and presumed to be buried in Patio 29 . Patio 29 was the largest of about twelve Pinochet era mass graves identified and searched . In September 1991 , two judges on cases by the Vicariate and family of disappeared leftist leader Bautista van Schouwen issued court orders to begin research projects to exhume and identify the graves . The majority of the 105 bodies recovered in 1991 appeared to have been shot and beaten . Some were missing limbs or were bound with wire . The victims were as young as 13 years old , and some coffins contained multiple bodies . Pinochet , who remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army during the 1991 exhumation , explained that bodies were stacked to save space ( \" What great economizing ! \" ) , and later apologized after public outcry . This comment embarrassed Pinochet 's followers and \" reactivated cultural revulsion and human rights sensibilities \" . In Reckoning with Pinochet , Stern wrote that the 1991 exhumation led the public to view Pinochet soldiers on trial as criminals . The Santiago Catholic Church 's antemortem records were matched with autopsy records to identify and return the bodily remains to living relatives . As of 2006 , 126 bodies were found , of which 96 were identified by the Medical Legal Institute in 1998 . Authorities reported that all bodies in Patio 29 had been exhumed by 2006 , though some families of the victims disagreed . More than 1000 of the disappeared from this period have not been found . Skepticism about the matches ' veracity emerged in 2003 , and the institute 's own DNA testing in 2005 revealed a project rife with mistakes and exaggerated certainty : 48 bodies were wrongly identified and 37 more were doubted . The Medical Legal Institute created a new DNA database in May 2007 . Three bodies were positively identified in late 2009 . Chile 's National Monuments Council declared Patio 29 a National Monument on 13 July 2006 at the request of a group of Chamber of Deputies legislators . The Council chose the site for its proof of the Pinochet military government 's elaborate procedures used to conceal the disappeared 's bodies and their identities . At the ceremony , Patio 29 was described as a symbol of the country 's painful history and an educational place for human rights . As a national monument , the site will be conserved and maintained by government funds unless ordered otherwise by the courts . It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile . In 2008 , the National Monuments Council ran an architectural contest to revitalize Patio 29 , and chose a project that would create a music plaza with seven copper columns linking V\u00edctor Jara 's tomb with Patio 29 . The memorial is made of 3,032 precast concrete bricks . = = Description = = Patio 29 is a common grave in Santiago General Cemetery where the victims of mutilation , torture , and execution under the Pinochet military government were buried . Augusto Pinochet came to power in the 1973 Chilean coup d '\u00e9tat , where he led the army that attacked the presidential palace and overthrew President Salvador Allende . The military junta replaced constitutional rule for 17 years , under which thousands of Chileans were detained and tortured . The Patio 29 cemetery section is bordered by Mexico Avenue to the north , O 'Higgins Avenue to the east , Copihues Street to the south , and Maitenes Street to the west . Though the cemetery changed its section numbering in 1987 , the section is still known as Patio 29 . The section has 105 graves , though many contained more than one person . The plots remain marked by their original rusted iron cross headstones with burial dates and \" NN \" for \" no name \" . Most of the dates fall within the last four months of 1973 . The site has not been reused for burials . Folksinger V\u00edctor Jara , a prominent casualty of Pinochet 's 1973 coup d '\u00e9tat , lies in a crypt across from Patio 29 . The Memorial for the Disappeared at the cemetery 's metro entrance and V\u00edctor Jara 's tomb near Patio 29 together form a ten-minute \" popular route \" walk through the cemetery for tourists , as opposed to the \" patrimonial route \" past the graves of Chilean political leaders . A sign at the Patio 29 memorial describes the site as \" an emblematic place of the human rights violations that took place between 1973 and 1990 as it was used to cover up the bodies and identities of the detained disappeared and politically executed during the military regime \" . The annual protests against the 11 September 1973 coup start at the then-besieged La Moneda presidential palace and conclude here in the General Cemetery . = = Cultural influence = = The exhumations at Patio 29 led to two documentaries : Patio 29 : Histories of Silence , and Fernando ha vuelto , which told the story of recovering Fernando Olivares Mori 's body from the plot , his burial , and an interview with his wife after the DNA-based doubts were posited . In a review of Patio 29 Tras la Cruz de Fierro , Katrien Klep placed the book alongside an international human rights trend towards \" memorialization \" , Southern Cone writings about \" monuments , memorials , and ' lugares de memoria ' [ places of memory ] \" , and interest in reconciling their divided societies . In keeping with this symbolism , Patio 29 became part of the Bachelet government 's \" symbolic reparation \" program .",

                    "text": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = The Australian cricket team in England in 1948 was captained by Don Bradman , who was making his fourth and final tour of England . The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match . This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles , and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time . According to the Australian federal government the team \" is one of Australia 's most cherished sporting legends \" . Including five Test matches , Australia played a total of 31 first-class fixtures , plus three other games , two of the non-first-class matches being played in Scotland . They had a busy schedule , with 112 days of play scheduled in 144 days , meaning that they often played every day of the week except Sunday . Their record in the first-class games was 23 won and 8 drawn ; in all matches , they won 25 and drew 9 ; many of the victories were by large margins . They won the Test series 4 \u2013 0 with one draw . The strength of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up , which included Bradman , Arthur Morris , vice-captain Lindsay Hassett , Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes , and the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . Due to the popularity of Bradman , generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time , and the fact that he had announced that it was his farewell international tour , the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country , and many records for match attendances were broken . The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times , in the Second , Third and Fourth Tests , and stands to this day . = = Touring party = = = = Significance = = The 1948 Australian team has great significance in cricket history as it is the only side to tour England unbeaten , earning the sobriquet The Invincibles . The tour was captain Donald Bradman 's last Test series , and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in . It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians . Even so , various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians as one of the best cricket teams ever , and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team , Warwick Armstrong 's Australian side of just after World War I , the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s . This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton , Bradman 's batting rival from the 1930s , who wrote ' the 1948 Australian side to England , side that some critics , ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season , dubbed the \" best Australian team ever \" \u2013 which was just moonshine . Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948 ' , but his view is very much in the minority . The high regard with which The Invincibles are held in the annals of Australian and world cricket is reflected in the various honours accorded to the players . Bradman , Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . Hassett , Morris and Harvey were later inducted , so that 20 % of the inductees are from the 1948 team . Of these six , all except Hassett were selected in Australia 's Team of the Century , with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy . Bradman , Lindwall , Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame . In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians . Graveney strongly disagreed with the result , writing ' there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman 's Australian tourists of 1948 ' . The computer regarded Sam Loxton as a member of the team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey , if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team . = = Preparations = = Since the resumption of cricket following World War II , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and their captain Donald Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . The committee that selected the touring party was Bradman , Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer . They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced the team that day . The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling . This was in large part because England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six-ball overs in the Tests ; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs , which usually takes more than 55 overs to accumulate , the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available . A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling , so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack , in this case Australia . Australia had injury concerns to key players ahead of the tour . Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack , and he only made the trip after a 3 \u2013 2 vote by a medical panel , despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit . Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon . In addition , his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action . The injury was worked on ahead of the tour , while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action . The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled , and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied . Bradman 's counsel was effective , as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour . Bill Jeanes , who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , was offered the job of managing the 1948 team , but turned it down . Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that cricket historian Gideon Haigh has called \" increasingly officious and liverish \" . He was replaced by Keith Johnson , the New South Wales delegate to the Australian Board of Control . Johnson had previously managed the Australian Services team \u2014 which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett \u2014 in the Victory Tests that took place in 1945 at the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe . = = = Warm-up matches in Australia = = = Before they sailed for England , Australia played three warm-up matches . The first two were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart and at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground , Launceston ; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth . In Hobart , Australia scored 538 / 5 declared with centuries by Barnes , Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122 . Using a mixture of pace and spin , they reduced Tasmania to 186 / 7 when time ran out . In Launceston , Australia won by an innings and 49 runs . Toshack took 5 / 24 as Tasmania fell for 123 . Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116 , Barnes taking 3 / 1 . Four days later , on Saturday 13 March , the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia . Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112 , while five bowlers took two wickets each . Australia replied with 442 / 7 declared , including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman . Western Australia only had time to reach 62 / 3 and the game was drawn . The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500 . = = Voyage and stopover in Ceylon = = The team set sail on board RMS Strathaird from Fremantle on Friday 19 March . En route to England , the Australians berthed in Colombo where they played a one-day single-innings match \u2014 not limited overs \u2014 against the Ceylon national team at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . The local newspaper The Islander ran a headline of \" Bradman Will Definitely Play \" and this guaranteed a crowd of more than 20,000 . Australia batted first and became suspicious about the pitch as the morning went on . At lunch , Ian Johnson demanded that the pitch be measured and it was found to be only 20 yards ( 18 m ) long . After that , the bowlers delivered from two yards behind the crease . Australia made 184 / 8 declared ( Barnes 49 , Miller 46 ) before a monsoon ended the match with Ceylon at 46 / 2 in reply . The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to a resounding welcome . Bradman announced the delivery of 17,000 food parcels as a gift to the British people from the State of Victoria . Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post-war austerity . = = Popularity = = Despite Australia 's ruthless on-field dominance and a succession of one-sided victories , the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest . Bradman 's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team 's popularity with the public , especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign . A leading cricket writer of the time , R. C. Robertson-Glasgow , said \" we want him to do well . We feel we have a share in him . He is more than Australian . He is a world batsman . \" The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \" cities , towns and hotels are beflagged , carpets set down , and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome . He is the Prince of Cricketers . \" Writing later , Haigh opined that \" perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer \" . Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day , and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live , causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin . Of Bradman 's retirement , Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack : \" ... a miracle has been removed from among us ... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal . \" As a team , the Australians were greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country , even when wet weather curtailed the matches . The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times , in the Second Test at Lord 's , the Third Test at Old Trafford , and the Fourth Test at Headingley . The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil . Off the field , the Australians were inundated with requests for social functions , including appointments with government officials and members of the royal family , and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements , with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days . Three-day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day , although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days . Team manager Keith Johnson , the only administrator in the touring party , was flooded with phone calls and letters . Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson 's tireless work would cause health problems and that \" it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through \" . Wisden said \" Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager , Mr Keith Johnson , hard-working and always genial ... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players , Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour . \" Bradman said that \" no side could have wished for a better manager \" . = = Bradman 's role = = Bradman 's position as a selector gave him more power than previous Australian captains , who did not have an explicit vote in team selection . This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while still an active player , a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history . According to Haigh , he \" was the dominant figure in Australian cricket \" , and an \" unimpeachable figure \" . At the age of 40 , Bradman was by four years the oldest player on the team ; three quarters of his team were 32 or younger , and some viewed him as a father figure . Bradman wrote that this was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . However , some players expressed displeasure at Bradman 's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition . Miller deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia 's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex . He also deplored Bradman 's hard-nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as \" festival matches \" . Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability , Miller played with reckless aggression , rather than a measured style in line with his captain 's aim of remaining undefeated . Bradman 's letters in later life , published posthumously , revealed his hostility towards Miller . Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence \u2014 one of the reserve batsmen \u2014 to partake in meaningful matchplay due to captain 's reluctance to risk Australia 's unbeaten run . = = Roles and strategy = = As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week \u2014 Sunday was always a rest day \u2014 Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate , except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire , the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson-Gower 's XI , when they chose their strongest team . As a result , no member of the squad \u2014 Bradman included \u2014 played in more than 23 of the first-class matches . Thus , the vice-captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested , and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them . Wisden opined that \" in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders \" . Likewise , the batting was regularly rotated . The three openers Barnes , Morris and Brown took turns sitting out , while the middle-order was changed frequently and the wicket-keeping duties divided between Tallon and Saggers . Australia 's bowling attack was led by Lindwall and Miller , who took the new ball in the Tests . Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something that usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs , and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign . The new ball rule also meant that spin bowling was less effective in the Tests , so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests , off spinner Johnson , until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring . Together they took only eight wickets . Things were different in the county matches . As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests , he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches , and the three spinners Ring , Johnson and McCool did more of the work , especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests . Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests , despite not being in Bradman 's first-choice team . Bradman even used Hamence , a reserve batsman , to open the bowling at times , in order to rest his bowlers , and in the second match against Yorkshire , decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win , so that his bowlers could recuperate . = = Ashes Test matches = = The five-Test Ashes series was won convincingly by Australia 4 \u2013 0 . England was captained by Norman Yardley and their batting was strong on paper , the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton , Cyril Washbrook , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . They were supported by the likes of Joe Hardstaff junior , Tom Dollery , Charlie Barnett , Jack Crapp , John Dewes , Allan Watkins , Yardley and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans . However , they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall , Miller and Johnston \u2014 supported by the medium pace of Toshack \u2014 a real handful , especially with the 55-over new ball rule . Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers , with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen . Prior to World War II , pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body . England were yet to develop similar bowlers , and as a result , Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation . At one stage , the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton , something that provoked great controversy . Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece , at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively , while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15 . For England , the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton , who scored 562 runs at 62.44 . Washbrook ( 356 runs at 50.85 ) was the only other player to average beyond 45 . In contrast , Australia 's batsmen had relatively little difficulty against the hosts ' attack . England 's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line-up he managed only 18 wickets at 38.22 . Alec Coxon , Dick Pollard , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support . Jim Laker , Jack Young , Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action . Bedser was the only English bowler to take more than nine wickets . Morris led the runscoring and century-making with 696 runs at 87.00 and three triple-figure scores , supported by Bradman ( 508 at 72.57 ) and Barnes ( 329 at 82.25 ) . With the first three batsmen in such form , Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings , averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets . The resounding Australian victories gave the England selectors many problems as they sought to find a combination that could challenge the tourists ' superiority . As a result , England used 21 players in all , while Australia only used 15 , one of which was forced by injury . Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests , while England only had seven such players . = = = First Test = = = Since the Second World War , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first-class matches , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . It was thought that Bradman would play Ring , but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The first innings set the pattern of the series as the England top-order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather , but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton . During the interval , heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption . Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall . At 15 / 2 , Compton came in , and together with Edrich , they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring , leaving England at 46 / 4 . Two runs later , Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board . Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74 , England only had two wickets left . Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Both fell within two runs , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top-scored with 63 . Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch . Australia 's openers Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes . Ideal batting conditions greeted the players on the second day . Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris . Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62 . Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker . Australia scored slowly , as Yardley employed leg theory to slow the scoring . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24 . Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 . Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes , with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes . It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs . On the third morning , Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg . Johnson and Tallon came and went , failing to pass 21 . The scoring was slow during this passage of play \u2014 Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs . Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting . Both fell in quick succession , but Australia 's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners , with Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44.2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook and Edrich fell early , leaving England at 39 / 2 . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton , who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day . Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The English had the better of the late afternoon period , scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes . Hutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated and a thunderstorm stopped proceedings . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending a 111-run partnership at 150 / 3 . The innings was then repeatedly interrupted by poor light . Wisden opined that \" rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day \" . Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack , and Barnett followed soon after at 264 / 5 . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge , aided by a 57-run partnership with his captain before Johnston dismissed Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead , with Compton on 154 . Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , which was briefly interrupted twice by rain . After the resumption , Compton was out hit wicket for 184 after attempting to hook Miller . He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden opined that \" No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances \" . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour . England finished at 441 , leaving Australia a target of 98 . Lindwall 's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each \u2014 Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg . This left Australia 48 / 2 . Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries . = = = Second Test = = = Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge . On the other hand , England made three changes ; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young , all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5.batsman . Following his injury in the previous Test , Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman , who gambled on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat . Miller played , but was unfit to bowl . Barnes fell for a duck , and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings , slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser . In the meantime , Morris , after a slow start , made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket , including 14 fours and one six . His innings was noted for powerful , well-placed cover drives . His dismissal left Australia at 166 / 3 , quickly followed by Miller , left Australia at 173 / 4 . Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly , taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225 / 6 . Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258 / 7 . Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Tallon batted on , supported by Johnston and Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Australia 's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston \u2014 who scored 29 . Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell . Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers , ending with 4 / 100 from 43 overs , while debutant Coxon took 2 / 90 from 35 overs . Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball . He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over . Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32 / 2 . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later . England were 46 / 4 and Australia were firmly in control . Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings , scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes . After the tea break , Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball . Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53 . One run later , Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134 / 6 with their skipper dismissed for 44 . Johnson then removed Evans for nine , before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket . After 85 minutes of resistance , Johnston removed both . England 's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9 / 207 . On the third morning , Lindwall removed Bedser , ending England 's innings at 215 , giving Australia a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall ended with 5 / 70 . The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings . Barnes was given an early life and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122 before Morris was bowled for 62 . Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket . Barnes accelerated after reaching his half-century . Once he reached his century , Barnes became particularly aggressive . He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs , including two successive sixes before finally falling for 141 , caught on the boundary from Yardley . He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings . The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296 / 2 after 277 minutes when he departed . Hassett was bowled first ball , so Miller came to the crease at 296 / 3 to face Yardley 's hat-trick ball . Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball . Bradman fell to Bedser again , this time for 89 . Brown joined Miller at 329 / 4 and Australia reached stumps at 343 , without further loss . After the rest day , the fourth morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 117 runs . Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller , who was out for 74 , followed by Lindwall for 25 . Bradman declared with Australia at 460 / 7 , 595 runs ahead . Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers , with two each . Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times . Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 , before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13 . Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65 / 3 . However , Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106 / 3 . The final day started poorly for England , with Compton being caught off Johnston from the second ball of the day . Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over . Eight runs later , Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer that stayed low . Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141 / 8 . England were bowled out for 186 , ceding a 409-run victory . Toshack ended the innings with 5 / 40 , while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively . The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were \u00a3 43,000 \u2014 a record for a Test in England . = = = Third Test = = = When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short-pitched bowling . The omission generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . Hutton 's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett . England made three further changes . Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department . Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp . Australia dropped Brown , who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings , for the all rounder Loxton . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The change in England 's opening pair did not result in better results . A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball , and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that helped the bowlers . Both fell early , leaving England 28 / 2 . Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves . Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer , but edged it into his face . This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting , resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added . They reached lunch at 57 / 2 . Upon the resumption , Crapp accelerated , hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson . Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37 . Dollery then fell for one . England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 / 4 . After 170 minutes of slow batting , Edrich fell to Lindwall . At 119 / 5 , Compton returned to the field , his wound having been stitched . Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141 / 6 , bringing Evans to the crease . Compton and Evans added 75 runs , before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216 / 7 . England resumed on the second day at 231 / 7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball . Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes , adding 37 and featuring in a 121-run partnership with Compton . Soon after , Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes , who was standing at short leg , forcing him into hospital . The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363 . Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting , having struck 16 fours . Lindwall took 4 / 99 and Johnston 3 / 67 . Barnes 's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener . Johnson was deployed as Australia 's makeshift second opener , but made only one , and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13 / 2 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell . Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126 / 3 at stumps . Australia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Miller fell for 31 . Four runs later , Morris fell for 51 , leaving Australia 139 / 5 . Barnes came in , despite having collapsed in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest . He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell . Lindwall came into bat at 172 / 6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled , leaving Australia 208 / 7 , five runs behind the follow-on mark . Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221 , giving England a lead of 142 runs . During his innings , Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich . One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand , evoking cheers from the crowd . Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers , taking 4 / 81 and 3 / 53 respectively . Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Lindwall did not bounce Edrich , but Miller did , earning the ire of the crowd . Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes . This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook . Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six , but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit . Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball , as England reached 174 / 3 at the close , with Washbrook unbeaten on 85 . The rest day was followed by the fourth day , which was abandoned due to persistent rain . Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day , leaving Australia a victory target of 317 , but the rain meant that the entire first session was lost . The tourists batted in a defensive manner to ensure a draw . They ended at 92 / 1 in 61 overs . Morris finished unbeaten on 54 , his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series . The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test . = = = Fourth Test = = = Australia made two changes for the Test . Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps . England made three changes . Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position . Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young . Dollery , who had made only 38 in three innings , was replaced by all-rounder Cranston . England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch . Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168 , the best by England in the series . Washbrook refrained from the hook shot , which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series . The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall . Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich , the pair batted until late in the first day , when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day . His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs . Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268 / 2 , with Edrich on 41 . The next day , Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich . The pair saw England to lunch without further loss , and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out after almost three hours of batting for 79 . Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes . Edrich fell three runs later at 426 / 4 for 111 . With two new batsmen at the crease , Australia quickly made further inroads to leave England at 473 / 6 . Loxton then successively removed Cranston , Evans and Laker as England fell from 486 / 6 to 496 / 9 , before Miller bowled Yardley to end England 's innings at 496 . The home team had lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs . Loxton took 3 / 55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two . Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury . With Barnes injured , Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris . Morris fell for six , before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63 / 1 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring , finishing unbeaten on 31 . On the third morning , England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 in the same over . This left Australia struggling at 68 / 3 . Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner \" Let 's get stuck into ' em \" . If England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six , but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , prompting Wisden to liken it to a \" hurricane \" . Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England 's firm control . Loxton was particularly severe on Laker , lifting his deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours . At the other end , Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329 / 6 . Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson , and 15 runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 , while Saggers only managed five , leaving Australia at 355 / 8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He was the last man out at 458 , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3 / 92 . Laker took 3 / 113 , while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each . England set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day . For the second time in the match , Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership . Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57 , leaving England at 129 / 2 . Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off , adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54 . England lost wickets at regular intervals late in the day to be 278 / 6 . When Johnston removed Compton for 66 , England were 7 / 293 with no recognised batsmen remaining , having lost 4 / 33 . Wicket-keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362 / 8 at the close of the fourth day . England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365 / 8 , with Evans on 47 not out . Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures , with 4 / 95 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin . This left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce . Only 44 runs came in the first hour . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack ; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121 / 1 . In the half hour preceding the interval , Australia had added 64 runs . Both had given chances , but England fumbled them . Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Compton , who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin , aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs . This prompted Yardley to take the new ball . Australia reached 202 , halfway to the required total , with 165 minutes left . Morris passed his century , and was then dropped on 126 . Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity . Australia reached tea at 288 / 1 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182 , having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required . He fell with eight runs still needed . Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs . Australia had won by seven wickets , setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase , with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours . The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds . The attendance remains a record for a Test in England . = = = Fifth Test = = = With the series already lost , England made four changes to their team . Dewes replaced the injured Washbrook , while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder . Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut . England played two spinners ; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker , while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard 's pace . The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes . Australia made three changes . Off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring . Australia 's second change was forced on them ; the injured seamer Toshack was replaced by the recovered batsman Barnes . The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury . The match saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch . Precipitation during the week meant that the start of the Test was delayed until the afternoon . The humid conditions , along with the rain , assisted the bowlers , with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Miller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2 / 1 , before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10 / 2 . Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch , and Miller then removed Crapp , who failed to score in his 23-ball innings , leaving England at 23 / 4 . After the lunch break , England had struggled to 35 / 4 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston dismissed him for a duck to leave England at 42 / 6 . Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match . Lindwall then removed Evans , Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Tallon , who grasped the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left . In his post-lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16.1 overs . Bradman described the spell as \" the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket \" . Hutton was the only batsman to resist , scoring 30 in 124 minutes from 147 deliveries . No other player passed seven . Miller and Johnston took 2 / 5 and 2 / 20 respectively , and Ring was not needed to bowl . In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , and Morris and Barnes passed England 's first innings total by themselves . The score had reached 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61 , ending a partnership that had taken only 126 minutes . This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day . As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat . Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers . With 6996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket , but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly . Hassett came in at 117 / 2 and Australia closed at 153 / 2 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 . On the second morning , Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett 's fall for 37 . The following four batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20 . Morris was finally removed for 196 , ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving ; it took a run out to remove Morris . Australia were eventually out for 389 . Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took 5 / 131 . England had relied heavily on spin ; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners . England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears . Lindwall made the early breakthrough , and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54 / 1 . Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes . On 39 , Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall . Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64 , having top-scored in both innings , to leave England at 153 / 4 . Thereafter , England collapsed in the fading light , . prompting the umpires to call off play . The ground was then hit by rain , resulting in a premature end to the day 's play . England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178 / 7 . England resumed on the fourth morning and Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs . Johnston ended with 4 / 40 and Lindwall 3 / 50 . This result sealed the series 4 \u2013 0 in favour of Australia . The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches . = = Other matches in Great Britain = = = = = v Worcestershire = = = At Worcester , 28 , 29 , 30 April . Worcestershire ( 233 and 212 ) lost to the Australians ( 462 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 17 runs . The pitch was slow , and the weather was cold and showery for the traditional tour opener against Worcestershire . Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than \u20a4 4000 . The hosts elected to bat , and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137 / 1 after 133 minutes . However , the dismissal of Charles Palmer , who top-scored with 85 , precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233 . Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets , with Johnson taking 3 / 52 . In their sole innings , Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris ( 138 ) and Bradman ( 107 ) . This took them to 265 / 1 , before they declared at 462 / 8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time . Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6 / 135 for the locals . In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs , with 70 minutes to spare . McCool took 4 / 29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets . = = = v Leicestershire = = = At Leicester , 1 , 3 , 4 May . The Australians ( 448 ) defeated Leicestershire ( 130 and 147 ) by an innings and 171 runs . Australia elected to bat , and Miller , who had been promoted to No. 3 , shared century partnerships with Barnes ( 78 ) and Bradman ( 81 ) . A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack , but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century . He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448 . The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler , taking 5 / 91 . Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings ; another Australian expatriate , Jack Walsh , top-scored with 33 . Ring took 5 / 34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs . Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced the prospect of being bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5 / 83 . After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day ; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat . Johnson ended with 7 / 42 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Bradford , 5 , 6 May . Yorkshire ( 71 and 89 ) lost to the Australians ( 101 and 63 / 6 ) by four wickets . This low-scoring game was the closest that Australia came to defeat on the tour . The game was played in cold , blustery , overcast and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers . Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings . Miller mixed medium-paced off-breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6 / 42 . At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4 / 22 from 26 overs . Together the pair bowled almost unchanged , delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs . Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4 / 38 . Miller came in at the start of the second day 's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added , before falling at 7 / 86 , part of a collapse of 5 / 27 . He hit two sixes in his innings , including one from the first ball that he faced , feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions . Australia ended at 101 , and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury . Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire , 6 / 51 . Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings , which followed a similar pattern to their first effort . Wickets fell steadily as Johnston ( 6 / 18 ) and Miller ( 3 / 49 ) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs . Australia were set a target of 60 runs for victory , and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett \" might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch \" . Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down . Australia slumped to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease . Harvey was given two chances , once when he was on one , and Tallon was also missed . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 , but Harvey won the game with a straight drive over the fence . Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece , and at the rate of every four overs . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 8 , 10 , 11 May . The Australians ( 632 ) defeated Surrey ( 141 and 195 ) by an innings and 296 runs . Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for the opening stand before the latter fell for 65 . Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket . Barnes ' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes . After Bradman departed at 403 / 3 , wickets began to fall more regularly , but Hassett held up his end and made 110 , while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50 . Surrey 's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4 / 104 . On the second afternoon , Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings . Johnson took 5 / 53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out , but received little support , the next highest scores being 15 and 10 . Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day . They made continual inroads on the final day , and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win . Johnston took 4 / 40 and Johnson 3 / 40 . = = = v Cambridge University = = = At Fenner 's , Cambridge , 12 , 13 , 14 May . Cambridge University ( 167 and 196 ) lost to the Australians ( 414 / 4 declared ) by an innings and 51 runs . Cambridge elected to bat and wickets fell regularly . No player made over 33 and the hosts were out in the second session of the first day for 167 . Miller was prominent with the ball and in the field , taking 5 / 46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers . In reply , Australia were already 184 / 1 at stumps , with Brown heading for a consecutive century . He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence , who made 92 . Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter , prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414 / 4 , having reached 61 not out himself . In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool , who took 7 / 78 as the match ended early on the third morning . Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000 . = = = v Essex = = = At Southend , 15 , 17 May . The Australians ( 721 ) defeated Essex ( 83 and 187 ) by an innings and 451 runs . After electing to bat , Australia made history on the first day by breaking the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day . Ironically , it was the only time they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour . With centuries from Brown ( 153 ) , Bradman ( 187 ) , Loxton ( 120 ) and Saggers ( 104 * ) , Australia 's first innings totalled 721 ; they were dismissed on the close of the first day 's play . Bradman 's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown 's 153 lasted three hours ; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145 / 1 . Bradman came in and seized the initiative , reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch , including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore . Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364 / 2 only halfway through the day 's play . Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia 's merciless crushing of their hosts , something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman . Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races , but this was refused by Bradman . The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest , but still did not get to go to the races . Later , Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket , before an late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5 / 57 , leaving Saggers unbeaten , but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career . After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen on the first day , Essex made only 83 in their first innings , capitulating within 37 overs . Toshack took 5 / 31 and Miller 3 / 14 , and Australia enforced the follow-on . Essex 's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46 / 6 . However , a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187 . Johnson ended with 6 / 37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day . The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record . = = = v Oxford University = = = At Oxford , 19 , 20 , 21 May . The Australians ( 431 ) defeated Oxford University ( 185 and 156 ) by an innings and 90 runs . Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss , and the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on 139 . Brown scored his third century in succession , before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108 . Morris , Loxton , McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431 . Oxford 's best batting performance came in the form of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings , resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket . Despite Kardar 's innings of 54 and 29 , the top-score in both innings , Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily . The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists ; Toshack took three in each innings , while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match . = = = v Marylebone Cricket Club = = = At Lord 's , 22 , 24 , 25 May . The Australians ( 552 ) defeated Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) ( 189 and 205 ) by an innings and 158 runs . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and with two other capped players , were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first-choice team . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage . After winning the toss , Australia batted first . After the loss of Morris early , Barnes ( 81 ) and Bradman ( 98 ) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160-run stand . Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98 , which took two hours , and Hassett then took over and added 51 . Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407 / 5 . He continued the next day and Australia 's highest scorer with 163 , and Johnson supported him with 80 . Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair 's departure , Australia reached 552 . Bradman 's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker . They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning . Miller and Lindwall then sought to gain an advantage over England 's leading batsmen \u2014 Hutton and Compton \u2014 before the Tests . The MCC side , composed almost entirely of Test players , reached 91 / 2 , Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104 / 5 . He took three more wickets to end with 6 / 51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189 , conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs . Some English observers decried Toshack 's leg stump attack as being negative , but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack 's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played . Bradman opted to enforce the follow on , and his spinners did most of the damage , McCool taking 4 / 35 and Johnson 3 / 37 . Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match , scoring 52 and 64 , and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory . The total attendance was 60,000 . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Manchester , 26 , 27 , 28 May . The Australians ( 204 and 259 / 4 ) drew with Lancashire ( 182 ) . The first day was abandoned due to rain . Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch . The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman 's wicket twice in the match , causing a media sensation . Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11 , the Australian captain 's first score on tour below 80 . The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40 . Australia looked set to concede a lead for the first time on tour as the hosts reached 3 / 129 , but Johnston ( 5 / 49 ) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire 's only innings , which ended on the third morning . With a result impossible , Australia had time for batting practice . Bradman reached 43 , and when Hilton came on , the Australian captain , perhaps perturbed by earlier events , attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack . After missing the first two balls , Bradman charged the third , swung and missed , fell over and was stumped . Harvey ( 76 * ) and Hamence ( 49 * ) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52 . = = = v Nottinghamshire = = = At Nottingham , 29 , 31 May 1 June . Nottinghamshire ( 179 and 299 / 8 ) drew with the Australians ( 400 ) . In Nottinghamshire 's first innings , Ray Lindwall took 6 / 14 from 15.1 overs , with only 10 scoring strokes being made off him . Reg Simpson made 74 and Joe Hardstaff junior 48 , but only one other batsman reached double figures . After their 98-run third-wicket stand was broken , Australia took 8 / 68 to bowl the hosts out for 179 . Lindwall , conceded less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall \" absolutely paralysed \" the batsmen , with some of his bowling \" in the real Larwood manner \" . Australia only batted once , and Brown top-scored with 122 in 3 hours 45 minutes , while Bradman added 86 . The Australia middle-order fell away and the tourists lost their last six wickets for 74 runs . In the county 's second innings , Keeton was hit in the chest by one of Lindwall 's deliveries and took no further part in the match . On the final day , Hardstaff hit the first century against the Australians on the tour , 107 , and Simpson again batted well , making 70 . Lindwall and the Australian pacemen were less incisive in the second innings , and Ring and Johnson took four and three wickets respectively . = = = v Hampshire = = = At Southampton , 2 , 3 , 4 June . Hampshire ( 195 and 103 ) lost to the Australians ( 117 and 182 / 2 ) by eight wickets . Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat against the Australians , who were led by Hassett while Bradman rested . The Australians were behind on the first innings for the first time on the tour and the match remained in the balance until the third afternoon . On a drying pitch , the hosts reached 116 / 3 before losing their remaining wickets for 79 to be all out for 195 , while Johnston took 6 / 74 . In reply , Australia fared worse and collapsed from 2 / 70 and made only 117 . Charles Knott 's off spin proved challenging for the Australians , but Miller scored three successive sixes from him before the collapse , top-scoring with 39 . In their second innings , both Miller and Johnston took five Hampshire wickets . John Arnold top-scored for the hosts in both innings , with 48 and 42 . Australia needed 182 runs in 175 minutes to win . Barnes went for a duck but Johnson , sent in five minutes before lunch , hit 74 out of a second-wicket partnership of 105 , including three sixes and seven fours . Brown , with 81 not out , and Hassett saw the Australians through to victory . = = = v Sussex = = = At Hove , 5 , 7 June . Sussex ( 86 and 138 ) lost to the Australians ( 549 / 5 declared ) by an innings and 325 runs . Lindwall won the match for the Australians with his bowling , taking 11 / 59 . After winning the toss , the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace , and he hit the off-stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6 / 34 . Loxton also bowled well in the first innings , taking 3 / 13 . Australia replied to Sussex 's 86 strongly , and were already 254 / 1 by the end of the first day . Powered by Morris 's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman ( 109 ) and Harvey ( 100 * ) , Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549 / 5 . They then still had time to send down 63.3 overs , enough to finish the match within two days . In Sussex 's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over . Harry Parks made 61 , but Sussex were all out for 138 , losing their last seven wickets for 59 . In all , eight of Lindwall 's wickets were bowled , five these by swinging yorkers , the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that \" Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions \" as Sussex \" crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew \" . At the other end , Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall . He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs . = = = v Northamptonshire = = = At Northampton , 16 , 17 , 18 June . Northamptonshire ( 119 and 169 ) lost to the Australians ( 352 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 64 runs . Starting the day after the First Test , the Northamptonshire match was interrupted by rain . Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7 / 61 before some tail-end resistance took them to 119 ; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each . The Australians passed the locals ' score on the first afternoon , and their innings was built around Hassett 's 127 , which included 17 fours . Morris and McCool also made fifties . Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings , Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each . In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Sheffield , 19 , 21 , 22 June . The Australians ( 249 and 285 / 5 declared ) drew with Yorkshire ( 206 and 85 / 4 ) . The Australians were made to work hard for their 249 , with only Bradman reaching 50 . Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores . Alec Coxon took 4 / 66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test . Yorkshire made 206 in reply , Toshack taking 7 / 81 and Johnston 3 / 101 : together , they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings . Like the Australians , the local batsmen struggled to make the most of their starts ; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40 . Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test , Bradman declared Australia 's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining . Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86 , putting on 154 for the second wicket . Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings . The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result . Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw . The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 30 June , 1 \u2013 2 July . Surrey ( 221 and 289 ) lost to The Australians ( 389 and 122 / 0 ) by 10 wickets . Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat . They made 221 , and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single-figure scores . As the match started the day after the Second Test , Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers , and Ring took three wickets , while the Test players only took two in total . Hamence opened the batting for Australia \u2014 Brown injured a finger while fielding \u2014 but he was out for a duck . Hassett ( 139 ) and Bradman ( 128 ) then put on 231 , Bradman making his sixth century of the tour . However , the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389 . Surrey made 289 in their second innings , with McCool taking 6 / 113 after bowling more than 40 % of the overs . The hosts batted steadily with three fifties , but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised . The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time . = = = v Gloucestershire = = = At Bristol , 3 , 5 , 6 July . The Australians ( 774 / 7 declared ) defeated Gloucestershire ( 279 and 132 ) by an innings and 363 runs . The Australians elected to bat and made the highest score of the tour , and it was also the second biggest score by an Australian team in England ( the 1893 team made 843 against a \" Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present \" at Portsmouth ) , and the highest score by an Australian team versus an English county . Morris 's 290 , made from 466 balls in five hours , was the highest individual score of the tour , and he featured in century stands with Barnes , Miller and Harvey . Loxton made 159 not out , Harvey 95 and McCool 76 . This match preceded the Third Test , and off spinner Tom Goddard was regarded as a candidate for England selection after strong performances in county cricket . However , Morris and Loxton 's aggressive attack gave Goddard figures of 0 / 186 from 32 overs , effectively ending his chances of selection . Former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \" Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . \" Instead , it was Loxton who forced his way into the Third Test . Gloucestershire replied with an innings of 279 , in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out , while Johnson took 6 / 68 . Made to follow on during the final day , the hosts made only 132 , losing their last eight wickets for 60 . Johnson took 5 / 32 to end with 11 / 100 for the match , while Ring took 5 / 47 to end with seven for the match . Australia 's spinners took 19 wickets . = = = v Middlesex = = = At Lord 's , 17 , 19 , 20 July . Middlesex ( 203 and 135 ) lost to the Australians ( 317 and 22 / 0 ) by ten wickets . Denis Compton hit a cautious 62 , but Middlesex lost wickets regularly to fall from 1 / 78 to 203 all out . Five bowlers shared the wickets , Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece . At one stage , Australia were 53 / 3 , but Morris ( 109 ) and Loxton ( 123 ) put on a partnership of 172 . No other batsman bettered Hamence 's 30 , and Jim Sims took 6 / 65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46 . Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings , with only John Dewes ( 51 ) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists , while eight managed only single figures . Five bowlers shared the wickets , and McCool was the only one to take three . McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs . = = = v Derbyshire = = = At Derby , 28 , 29 , 30 July . The Australians ( 456 ) defeated Derbyshire ( 240 and 182 ) by an innings and 34 runs . The Australians chose to bat first , and Brown top scored with 140 , his first 50 taking three hours . He shared century stands with Bradman , who made 62 , and Miller ( 57 ) . Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings , losing 7 / 142 . Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57 , while Miller , Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece . The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs . In their second innings they made 182 , with Denis Smith making 88 , the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians . However , only one other player reached double figures , as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9 / 72 , taking 6 / 77 , while Loxton took 3 / 16 . There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day . = = = v Glamorgan = = = At Swansea , 31 July , 2 \u2013 3 August . Glamorgan ( 197 ) drew with the Australians ( 215 / 3 ) . Rain prevented play after 3pm on the second day . No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197 , with the four Australian bowlers , Lindwall , Miller , Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets . The Australians ' 215 / 3 was based on an aggressive 84 from Miller , with five sixes and seven fours , and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett , who was 71 not out when the rain came . The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000 . = = = v Warwickshire = = = At Birmingham , 4 , 5 , 6 August . Warwickshire ( 138 and 155 ) lost to the Australians ( 254 and 41 / 1 ) by nine wickets . Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet pitch and the hosts struggled to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs . Martin Donnelly ( 28 ) was the only batsman to pass 20 , and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each . Australia scored 254 in reply ; Hassett top-scored with 68 , Lindwall made 45 , and the pair 's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match . Three other batsmen reached 30 , but most of the Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin of Eric Hollies , who opened the bowling and took 8 / 107 , the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour . This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call-up for the fifth and final Test . In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs , Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each , the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs . Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Old Trafford , Manchester , 7 , 9 , 10 August . The Australians ( 321 and 265 / 3 declared ) drew with Lancashire ( 130 and 199 / 7 ) . Cyril Washbrook 's benefit match brought him a then record sum , \u00a3 14,000 , but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test . The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes ( 67 ) reaching 50 . Nine of the Australians made a start , reaching 14 , but could not capitalise on their opportunities , and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123 . The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6 / 73 . Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38 , while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece , but the Australians did not enforce the follow on . Australia made 265 / 5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133 , his highest at Old Trafford , with 90 for Barnes . Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match , but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day . Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers . Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller , who refused to bowl , saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century . Lindwall ( 4 / 27 ) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century . = = = v Durham = = = At Sunderland , 11 , 12 August . The Australians ( 282 ) drew with Durham ( 73 / 5 ) . In the absence of the resting Bradman , Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . Attendance was 17,000 on the first day of this two-day non-first-class match . Rain prevented any play on the second day . After a poor start that saw them fall to 22 / 3 , McCool ( 64 ) and Miller ( 55 ) made half-centuries for the Australians . Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20 , but none went on . Paceman Keith Jackson took 5 / 76 for the hosts . Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match . = = = v Kent = = = At Canterbury , 21 , 23 August . The Australians ( 361 ) defeated Kent ( 51 and 124 ) by an innings and 186 runs . Australia elected to bat first and Brown made 106 , while Bradman ( 65 ) and Harvey ( 60 ) both scored half-centuries . Kent collapsed to the lowest score of the tour in the first innings , succumbing in only 23 overs . Johnston and Loxton both took 3 / 10 , and six local batsmen made ducks . Forced to follow on , half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings . Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71 , but the match , held in front of record crowds for the ground , ended inside two days , soon after Evans was run out . It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets . Lindwall took 4 / 37 in the second innings ; all his wickets were top-order batsmen . = = = v Gentlemen of England = = = At Lord 's , 25 , 26 , 27 August . The Australians ( 610 / 5 declared ) defeated the Gentlemen of England ( 245 and 284 ) by an innings and 81 runs . In his last match at Lord 's , Bradman won the toss and made his ninth century ( 150 ) of the tour against a side composed almost entirely of Test players . Brown ( 120 ) and Hassett ( 200 * ) also scored centuries , and Miller made 69 . Bradman elected to bat into the second day . The Gentlemen responded with 242 of which Reg Simpson made 60 and , following on , 284 , with Bill Edrich making 128 . There were no other scores beyond 30 in either innings . Ring took 5 / 70 for the innings and eight for the match , while Johnson secured seven wickets . The Victorian spin duo bowled the majority of the overs in both innings . = = = v Somerset = = = At Taunton , 28 , 30 August . The Australians ( 560 / 5 declared ) defeated Somerset ( 115 and 71 ) by an innings and 374 runs . After winning the toss , the Australians made all their runs on the first day , with centuries for Hassett ( 103 ) , Harvey ( 126 ) and Johnson ( 113 * ) and 99 for Hamence . The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket , through Hassett and Barnes , who was replaced by Harvey after retiring ill . The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries , and were keen to see Hamence do the same . The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone , only to see him stumped for 99 , his highest score for the season . On the Monday , the second day , on a pitch that was taking spin , Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total . McCool took 4 / 21 and 4 / 23 , and Johnston also took eight , including 5 / 34 in the second innings . He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner , and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls . = = = v South of England = = = At Hastings , 1 , 2 , 3 September . The Australians ( 522 / 7 declared ) drew with the South of England ( 298 ) . The tourists elected to bat and after losing the openers early , Hassett top scored with 151 , his third consecutive century . He was supported by Bradman ( 143 ) and Harvey ( 110 ) , whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total . Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey . Harvey 's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day . The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain , and Compton made 82 in the showers . Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4 / 16 in 4.1 overs to finish off the tail , the only time he bowled in first-class matches on the entire tour . There was no time left for the second innings . = = = v HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI = = = At Scarborough , 8 , 9 , 10 September . HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI ( 177 and 75 / 2 ) drew with the Australians ( 489 / 8 declared ) . This was the final match for Bradman in England , and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions . It was Australia 's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full-strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Ring . The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat , but Lindwall took 6 / 59 in an innings that lasted into the second day , bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively , sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62 . Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face , breaking his nose . Australia reached 2 / 407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8 / 469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result . Leveson-Gower 's XI played out time , with Bradman bowling the last over . = = = v Scotland = = = At Edinburgh , 13 , 14 September . The Australians ( 236 ) defeated Scotland ( 85 and 111 ) by an innings and 40 runs . The match against Scotland was a two-day fixture that did not have first-class status . Australia elected to bat and Morris top-scored with 112 , and McCool made 52 , but all struggled against the leg-spin of William Laidlaw , who took 5 / 51 . The Australians collapsed at the end , losing their last six wickets for 36 runs , and only three made double figures . Scotland collapsed against Johnston and Johnson , who took 6 / 15 and 3 / 18 respectively . Forced to follow on , a second innings opening stand of 50 preceded a second collapse , this time Ring and Morris took 4 / 20 and 5 / 10 . Only three Scottish players passed double figures in either innings . = = = v Scotland = = = At Aberdeen , 17 , 18 September . Scotland ( 178 and 142 ) lost to the Australians ( 407 / 6 declared ) by an innings and 87 runs . In another two-day non-first-class match , Scotland batted better than in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat , but still lost . Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts ' 178 , before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool , promoted to open , made 108 , while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5 . Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring . Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball , and the wickets were shared , with nobody taking more than four .",

The date of foundation of the church , which is in the village of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy , is unknown , but the oldest parts date from the 11th or 12th century . It has twice been enlarged : in the 15th century , when the chancel was rebuilt , and in the 16th century , when a chapel was added to the south of the chancel , separated by three arches . The tower at the west end is from the 17th century . A south porch of unknown date has been converted into a vestry , and the church is now entered through the tower . St Mary 's is a Grade I listed building , a national designation given to buildings of \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" , in particular because it is regarded as \" a fine rural parish church , incorporating significant early Medieval fabric \" . Writers in the 19th century commented on the \" lofty square tower \" , the \" very good \" east window , and the \" many elegant monuments \" ; the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones called St Mary 's \" one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island \" . In the 21st century , one writer has noted the \" impressive lychgate \" and a guide to the buildings of the region calls it \" the most important church in north west Anglesey \" . The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of nine in a combined parish , although as of 2013 there has not been an incumbent priest since September 2009 . People associated with the church include James Williams , a 19th-century rector who was awarded a gold medal for his efforts to save lives at sea , and his great-grandson , the artist Sir Kyffin Williams . Both are buried in the churchyard . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is the parish church for the village of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in the north-west of Anglesey , north Wales . It is set in a churchyard at the side of a minor road , in the south-east of the village . The area is near the coast , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) from the port town of Holyhead . Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy takes its name in part from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and \" \u2011 fair \" is a modified form of the saint 's name ( Mair being Welsh for \" Mary \" ) . The parish \u2019 s coastal position is reflected in its full name , which means \" St Mary 's in the promontory \" , or \" St Mary in the angle of the waters \" . It is uncertain when the first church was constructed on the site . There was a church in Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy before 1254 , mentioned in the Norwich Taxation of that year . The oldest parts of the present structure are the nave walls and the arch between the nave and the chancel ( to the east of the nave ) ; these date from the 11th or 12th century . In the 15th century , the chancel was reconstructed and enlarged ; in the following century , a chapel was added to the south of the chancel , separated by an arcade of three arches . In her 1833 history of Anglesey , Angharad Llwyd said that the south chapel \" belongs exclusively \" to one of the local landed estates , and the chancel belonged to another . A tower was added at the west end in the 17th century , perhaps in 1660 according to a 2009 guide to the buildings of the region . At some stage , a porch was added to the south-west corner of the nave , but it has \" no datable features \" . In the middle of the 19th century the porch entrance was blocked off and replaced by a window , and since then access to the church has been through a door on the west side of the tower . Some restoration work was carried out in 1847 by the Sheffield-based architects Weightman and Hadfield . Their plans included a proposal to add a chapel to the north side , but this did not happen . Further work was undertaken in 1860 , and some repairs were carried out in the chancel and south chapel in the 1930s under the architect and historian Harold Hughes . St Mary 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of nine churches in the combined benefice of Bodedern with Llanfaethlu . It is within the deanery of Llifion and Talybolion , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2013 , there is no incumbent priest at the church , and there has not been one since September 2009 . James Williams , rector of St Mary 's from 1821 to 1872 , helped to establish the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Lives from Shipwreck in 1828 , in the wake of a storm that caused a boat to sink with 140 deaths . He was awarded a gold medal by the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck ( later renamed the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ) in 1835 , for his efforts in the rescue of a boat during a gale . Angharad Llwyd , writing when Williams was at St Mary 's , noted that \" this benevolent gentleman , aided by his lady , ever alert in the cause of humanity , are generally among the first on the shore , in case of accident , well supplied with restoratives , and other necessaries , to comfort and protect the suffering mariners . \" The artist Sir Kyffin Williams ( 1918 \u2013 2006 ) was a great-grandson of James and his wife Frances . At his request , a memorial to them was put up on the south wall of the chapel . James , Frances and Kyffin are buried in the churchyard . The churchyard also contains the Commonwealth war graves of a Royal Navy sailor of World War I and another from World War II . = = Architecture and fittings = = = = = Structure = = = St Mary 's is a medieval church , built using rubble masonry dressed with freestone and displaying Perpendicular details . The roof is made of slate with stone copings . Internally , the timbers of the roofs of the nave , chancel and chapel are exposed . The beams running the length of the nave are decorated at intervals by painted plaster shield designs . The chancel roof is from the late 15th century , and the chapel roof is from the early part of the following century . = = = Interior = = = The church is entered through the door at the west side of the tower , with modern double doors between the tower and the nave set into a plain square doorway dating from the 17th or 18th century . The nave is 27 feet 9 inches by 13 feet 8 inches ( 8.5 by 4.2 m ) . Between the nave and the chancel there is a plain round arch , from the 11th or 12th century , a step up , and a rail . At the east end of the chancel , there is a further step up from the chapel into the sanctuary , which has some 18th-century gravestones set into it . The late 15th-century chancel , which measures 32 feet 6 inches by 14 feet ( 9.9 by 4.3 m ) , has some memorials from the 18th and early 19th centuries . One is to a bonesetter called Evan Thomas ( died 1814 ) , erected by Thomas Bulkeley , 7th Viscount Bulkeley ; another , to Emma Viscountess Bulkeley Williams , is made from ornately decorated marble . The three arches between the chancel and chapel rest on octagonal columns . One of the arches has inscribed upon it , in early 16th-century lettering , SCA MARIA ORA PRO ME DAVID A JACO ( \" Saint Mary pray for me David ap Iago \" ) ; another has a stone with a roughly carved face . There was once a rood screen across the chancel , as shown by markings on the north wall and on the westernmost of the arches . It was still in position in 1867 , when one visitor mentioned it in his notes on the church . Panelling has been fixed to the east and south walls of the sanctuary in the chapel as a reredos . The chapel measures 32 feet 6 inches by 14 feet 6 inches ( 9.9 by 4.4 m ) . The font is at the rear of the nave on the north side . It is octagonal on the outside , with a circular bowl inside . A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded : a large silver chalice , inscribed with the donor 's name and the year 1713 ; a plain silver paten , dated 1724 \u2013 25 ; and a pewter flagon , from about 1710 . = = = Windows = = = The nave has two windows . The south window , to the east of the vestry , is from the 14th century . It has two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) with flat tops and is decorated with stone tracery . A survey of the church in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted the window \u2019 s \" crude workmanship and design . \" The window on the north nave wall has three lights with rounded tops . It too has been dated to the 14th century , but other sources say that it is from the 16th century . A 2009 guide to buildings of north-west Wales says that the window is \" typically 16th-century \" . The 15th-century window at the east end of the chancel has three lights topped with cinquefoils ( a pattern of five joined circles ) . The lights are decorated with tracery , and set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould . Stained glass from 1850 depicts ( from north to south ) Christ with children , Christ at a table , and the cross . The north window in the chancel is a 19th-century copy of the north nave window . There are two windows in the chapel , each with three lights ; one in the east wall from the 16th century set in an arch with a hood mould , the other in the south wall set in a flat-headed frame . = = = Tower and porch = = = The tower has external buttresses and the door on the west side is set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould . The buttresses and door were added to the tower after it was built ; the 1937 Royal Commission survey described them as \" modern \" . There are two stages ( levels ) to the tower ; the tall upper stage is slightly narrower than the base , which measures 8 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 9 inches ( 26 by 2.7 m ) . The tower has simple rectangular openings in the north , east and south walls . There is a 17th-century bell in the west wall of the tower in a plain arch opening ; the top of the wall is crenellated . Behind the parapet at the top of the tower , there is a short spire in the shape of a pyramid , made from wood and covered in slates . The south porch has been described as \" unusually long \" ; it measures 11 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 9 inches ( 3.5 by 2.7 m ) and has been used as a vestry since the external doorway was blocked off and converted into a window . The 14th-century doorway from the nave into the vestry has a pointed head in a square frame , and was described in the 1937 survey as having an \" unusual design \" . The porch roof may be from the late medieval period . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade I listed building \u2013 the highest grade of listing , designating \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" ; fewer than 2 per cent of the listed buildings in Wales are in this category . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 , as \" a fine rural parish church , incorporating significant early Medieval fabric , including a 12th-century chancel arch \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the \" good late Medieval additions , including a fine 16th-century arcaded chapel \u201d , and says that St Mary 's is of \" special interest \" because of its early date , \" and for the quality of its later detail \" . Writing in 1833 , before the restoration of 1847 , Angharad Llwyd described the church as \" a spacious ancient structure , partly in the Norman style , with a lofty square tower , of rude architecture \" . She noted the \" massive circular pillars and arches \" in the chancel , and the \" peculiar good taste \" of the architecture of the recently rebuilt rectory . The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis remarked upon the \" many elegant monuments \" in the church . Writing in 1862 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that it was \" one of the largest churches in this division of Anglesey \" He said that it had recently been \" judiciously repaired and restored \" by James Williams and was \" now one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island \" , adding that the east window was \" good in detail and in execution \" . The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1867 . He said that the east window was \" a very good Perpendicular one of three lights , early in the style . \" He described the churchyard as \" secluded , and shaded by fine trees \" and the tower as \" rude and plain \" , noting that the \" open bell arch \" on the west side was comparable to the one at St Mary 's Church , Llanerchymedd . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes the \" fairly large church \" as standing in a \" quiet wooded location \" . It also comments upon the \" impressive lychgate \" at the entrance to the churchyard and the \" squat pyramidal structure \" on top of the tower . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the former county of Gwynedd calls St Mary 's \" the most important church of north-west Anglesey \" and says that it has \" an unusual plan \" .",

It was originally a chapel of ease for the parish church of St Peulan 's , Llanbeulan , but the township that it once served , Tal-y-llyn , no longer exists . It was declared a redundant church in the early 1990s , and has been in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches since 1999 . Services are held once per month during part of the year . The date of the church is unknown , but the oldest parts could be from the 12th century . The chancel was rebuilt in the 16th century , and a side chapel added in the 17th century . The church furnishings , such as pews , pulpit and communion rails , were added in the 18th century , although some of the pews are modern replacements after vandalism . It is a Grade I listed building , a national designation given to buildings of \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" , because it is \" a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple , rustic character . \" = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is in a rural and thinly populated part of Anglesey , about 4.25 kilometres ( 2.6 mi ) northeast of Aberffraw and about 3.75 kilometres ( 2.3 mi ) southwest of Gwalchmai . It stands on a low mound with a circumference of approximately 120 yards ( 110 m ) ; the wall around the churchyard , which contains no gravestones , follows the shape of the mound to some extent . Its original purpose was to serve as one of five chapels of ease for the local parish church , St Peulan 's , Llanbeulan , about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) to the north ; St Peulan 's itself has now closed . The township that St Mary 's served , Tal-y-llyn , has now disappeared , although before the time of the Black Death there were 22 houses here . The date of foundation of the church is unknown . The nave is the oldest part of the church , possibly built in the 12th century . Later changes saw the rebuilding of the chancel ( in the late 16th century ) and the addition of a chapel on the south side of the building ( in the 17th century ) . It was used for services until the early 1990s , and was then made a redundant church in about 1992 . It was placed in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1999 , who hold a 999 year lease effective from 19 November 1999 . Services are held in the church on one Sunday afternoon per month between May and October . = = Architecture and fittings = = The church was constructed using rubble masonry with boulder quoins . The floor is laid with flagstones throughout , and the roof has modern slates . The nave measures 25 by 13 feet ( 7.6 by 4.0 m ) , the chancel measures 16 feet 6 inches by 11 feet ( 5.03 by 3.47 m ) , and the chapel adjoining the chancel on the south side is 9 by 8 feet ( 2.7 by 2.4 m ) . Between the nave and chancel is a pointed arch , with some 13th-century elements but probably reconstructed in the 16th century . The side chapel has rectangular windows in the east and west walls from the 17th century ; a narrow stone bench runs along the west and south walls of the chapel . The roof trusses , which date from the 15th and 17th centuries , are visible inside the building and the undersides are chamfered . There are two rectangular windows in the north wall of the nave ( 20th century additions ) , matching the window in the north wall of the chancel . The east window , in the chancel , has three rounded lights set in a square frame ; it dates from the latter part of the 16th century . The windows still have their clear leaded glass but are now boarded up . There are no windows on the south side , which is the most exposed side . There is an empty bellcote on the roof at the west end of the nave . The entrance is also at the west end , where there is a rounded arch doorway set deep into the thick wall , possibly dating from the 14th century . The 12th-century font was removed when the church was made redundant ; it is now in the nearby church of St Maelog , Llanfaelog . The church now houses a 15th-century octagonal font made of gritstone , positioned on an octagonal stem . The communion rails are dated 1764 and is of a simple design ; the pulpit , also 18th-century , has recessed panels . There are stone benches along the north and south walls of the nave . Many of the pews , which dated from the 18th century , were vandalised or stolen after the church was made redundant . Replacements were made by a local craftsman as part of the restoration project carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the Friends of Friendless Churches . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade I listed building \u2013 the highest grade of listing , designating buildings of \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" .

One modern guide to the buildings of the region comments that it has \" the vernacular character of Anglesey 's country buildings , which survives scarcely at all in the churches . \" The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis , however , took a different view of the building , calling it \" a small edifice of no interest \" .",

Described as \" beautiful \" by an Arab geographer in the 10th century , the Great Mosque 's minaret was toppled in an earthquake in 1033 . In 1149 , the Crusaders built a cathedral dedicated to John the Baptist , but it was mostly destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1187 , and then rebuilt as a mosque by the Mamluks in the early 13th century . It was destroyed by the Mongols in 1260 , then soon restored only for it to be destroyed by an earthquake at the end of the century . The Great Mosque was restored again by the Ottomans roughly 300 years later . Severely damaged after British bombardment during World War I , the mosque was restored in 1925 by the Supreme Muslim Council . = = Location = = The Great Mosque is situated in the Daraj Quarter of the Old City in Downtown Gaza at the eastern end of Omar Mukhtar Street , southeast of Palestine Square . Gaza 's Gold Market is located adjacent to it on the south side , while to the northeast is the Katib al-Wilaya Mosque and to the east , on Wehda Street , is a girls ' school . = = History = = = = = Philistine and Byzantine era = = = According to tradition , the mosque stands on the site of the Philistine temple dedicated to Dagon \u2014 the god of fertility \u2014 which Samson toppled in the Book of Judges . Later , a temple dedicated to Marnas \u2014 god of rain and grain \u2014 was erected . Local legend today claims that Samson is buried under the present mosque . The building was constructed in 406 CE as a large Byzantine church by Empress Aelia Eudocia , although it is also a possible that the church was built by Emperor Marcian . Based on a Jewish inscription carved on the upper tier of one of the building 's columns , it was suggested in the late 19th century that the upper pillars of the building were brought from a 3rd-century Jewish synagogue in Caesarea Maritima . The discovery of a 6th-century synagogue at the port of Gaza ( Maiumas ) in the 1960s , however , make local re-use of this column much likelier . In addition to the inscription , the column depicted a menorah , a shofar , a lulav and etrog surrounded by a decorative wreath ; the inscription read \" Hananyah son of Jacob \" in both Hebrew and Greek . The church appeared in the Map of Madaba mosaic , created in 600 CE . = = = Islamic era = = = The Byzantine church was transformed into a mosque in the 7th-century by Omar ibn al-Khattab 's generals , in the early period of Rashidun rule . The mosque is alternatively named \" al-Omari \" in honor of Omar ibn al-Khattab who was caliph during the Muslim conquest of Palestine . In 985 , during Abbasid rule , Arab geographer al-Muqaddasi wrote that the Great Mosque was a \" beautiful mosque . \" On 5 December 1033 , an earthquake caused the pinnacle of the mosque 's minaret to collapse . In 1149 the Crusaders , who had conquered Gaza in 1100 , built a cathedral dedicated to John the Baptist atop the ruins of the church upon a decree by Baldwin III of Jerusalem . However , in William of Tyre 's descriptions of grand Crusader churches , it is not mentioned . Of the Great Mosque 's three aisles today , it is believed that portions of two of them had formed part of the Cathedral of John the Baptist . In 1187 the Ayyubids under Saladin wrested control of Gaza from the Crusaders and destroyed the cathedral . The Mamluks reconstructed the mosque in the 13th-century , but in 1260 , the Mongols destroyed it . It was rebuilt thereafter , but in 1294 , an earthquake caused its collapse . Extensive renovations centered on the iwan were undertaken by the governor Sunqur al-Ala 'i during the sultanate of Husam ad-Din Lajin between 1297-99 . A later Mamluk governor of the city , Sanjar al-Jawli , commissioned the restoration of the Great Mosque sometime between 1311 and 1319 . The Mamluks finally rebuilt the mosque completely in 1340 . In 1355 Muslim geographer Ibn Battuta noted the mosque 's former existence as \" a fine Friday mosque , \" but also says that al-Jawli 's mosque was \" well-built . \" Inscriptions on the mosque bear the signatures of the Mamluk sultans al-Nasir Muhammad ( dated 1340 ) , Qaitbay ( dated May 1498 ) , Qansuh al-Ghawri ( dated 1516 ) , and the Abbasid caliph al-Musta 'in Billah ( dated 1412 ) . In the 16th-century the mosque was restored after apparent damage in the previous century ; the Ottomans commissioned its restoration and also built six other mosques in the city . They had been in control of Palestine since 1517 . The interior bears an inscription of the name of the Ottoman governor of Gaza , Musa Pasha , brother of deposed Husayn Pasha , dating from 1663 . = = = Modern era = = = Some Western travelers in the late 19th-century reported that the Great Mosque was the only structure in Gaza worthy of historical or architectural note . The Great Mosque was severely damaged by Allied forces while attacking the Ottoman positions in Gaza during World War I. The British claimed that there were Ottoman munitions stored in the mosque and its destruction was caused when the munitions were ignited by the bombardment . Under the supervision of former Gaza mayor Said al-Shawa , it was restored by the Supreme Muslim Council in 1926-27 . In 1928 , the Supreme Muslim Council held a mass demonstration involving both local Muslims and Christians at the Great Mosque in order to rally support for boycotting elections and participation in the Legislative Assembly of the British Mandate of Palestine government . To increase the number of people in the rally , they ordered all the mosques in one of Gaza 's quarters to temporarily close . The ancient bas-relief inscriptions of Jewish religious symbols were allegedly chiseled away intentionally at some stage between 1987 and 1993 . During the Battle of Gaza between the Palestinian organizations of Hamas and Fatah , the mosque 's pro-Hamas imam Mohammed al-Rafati was shot dead by Fatah gunmen on June 12 , 2007 , in retaliation for the killing of an official of Mahmoud Abbas 's presidential guard by Hamas earlier that day . The mosque is still active and serves as an emotional and physical support base for Gaza 's residents and a focal point of Palestinian pride . = = Architecture = = The Great Mosque has an area of 4,100 square metres ( 44,000 sq ft ) . Most of the general structure is constructed from local marine sandstone known as kurkar . The mosque forms a large sahn ( \" courtyard \" ) surrounded by rounded arches . The Mamluks , and later the Ottomans , had the south and southeastern sides of the building expanded . Over the door of the mosque is an inscription containing the name of Mamluk sultan Qalawun and there are also inscriptions containing the names of the sultans Lajin and Barquq . = = = Interior = = = When the building was transformed into a mosque from a cathedral , most of the previous Crusader construction was completely replaced , but the mosque 's facade with its arched entrance is a typical piece of Crusader ecclesiastical architecture , and columns within the mosque compound still retain their Italian Gothic style . Some of the columns have been identified as elements of an ancient synagogue , reused as construction material in the Crusader era and still forming part of the mosque . Internally , the wall surfaces are plastered and painted . Marble is used for the western door and the dome 's oculus . The floors are covered with glazed tiles . The columns are also marble and their capitals are built in Corinthian style . The central nave is groin-vaulted , each bay being separated from one another by pointed transverse arches with rectangular profiles . The nave arcades are carried on cruciform piers with an engaged column on each face , sitting on a raised plinth . The two aisles of the mosque are also groin-vaulted . Ibn Battuta noted that the Great Mosque had a white marble minbar ( \" pulpit \" ) ; it still exists today . There is a small mihrab in the mosque with an inscription dating from 1663 , containing the name of Musa Pasha , a governor of Gaza during Ottoman rule . = = = Minaret = = = The mosque is well known for its minaret , which is square-shaped in its lower half and octagonal in its upper half , typical of Mamluk architectural style . The minaret is constructed of stone from the base to the upper , hanging balcony , including the four-tiered upper half . The pinnacle is mostly made of woodwork and tiles , and is frequently renewed . A simple cupola springs from the octagonal stone drum and is of light construction similar to most mosques in the Levant . The minaret stands on what was the end of the eastern bay of the Crusader church . Its three semicircular apses were transformed into the base of the minaret .",

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust . The church stands in the centre of the town in a dominating position on Market Hill . A church has been on the site since at least 1180 , but the current structure dates from the 15th century , though there have been several restorations in the intervening period . Formerly a spired church , St. Peter 's now has a bell tower which , like the rest of the building , is mainly covered in flint . The interior of the church features paintings by George Frederick Bodley and Robert Cardinal , and a pipe organ originally made by T. C. Lewis . = = History = = The earliest documentary record of the church is in 1180 , when it was a chapel of ease to St Gregory 's church . The church was built in three stages , beginning with the first two bays of the chancel and the base of the tower in about 1330 \u2013 48 . The later stages of building were in about 1360 , and in about 1425 \u2013 50 . In 1643 , during the Civil War , the iconoclast William Dowsing damaged many of the items in the church . A restoration took place in 1685 , which included some alterations to the nave roof . A clock was installed in 1701 , and during the first half of the 18th century a spire of metal and wood was added ; this was replaced by another spire in 1810 . The church was restored again in 1858 \u2013 59 by William Butterfield ; this included removal of the three galleries and the box pews , re-laying the chancel floor , and replacement of the pulpit . Stained glass made by Hardman & Co. was installed in some of the windows , and more stained glass by Hardman was installed later in the century . In 1898 the chancel was restored and redecorated by George Frederick Bodley . A wooden reredos was installed in the Lady Chapel . The stonework of the exterior was restored in 1911 , when statues were inserted into three niches in the south porch . A further restoration took place in 1968 when the upper part of the tower was replaced , the spire was taken down , and most of Bodley 's paintings were removed from the chancel . The church was declared redundant in 1972 , and in 1976 was vested in the Redundant Churches Fund , the forerunner of the Churches Conservation Trust . A charitable trust , The Friends of St. Peter 's has been established to maintain and improve the church . Since being made redundant , the church has been used occasionally for services , and for a variety of events , including concerts , organ recitals and exhibitions . = = Architecture = = = = = Exterior = = = The church is constructed mainly in flint , with some stone , brick and tiles . Its plan is not quite rectangular , as it had to be confined into a limited space . The northwest corner is cut across , and the chancel is not fully in alignment with the nave . The plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory , north and south aisles , a two-bay chancel with the organ chamber and vestry to the north and the Lady Chapel to the south , and an extended sanctuary to the east , and a west tower incorporated in the body of the church . Its architectural styles are Decorated and Perpendicular . The tower is in three stages with angle buttresses . Its parapet consists of stepped battlements , and at the corners are statues rather than pinnacles . The aisles also have battlemented parapets , and there are more buttresses around the church . The main entrance to the church is through the west door at the base of the tower . Formerly the main entrance was through the south porch . The three statues on the exterior of the porch represent Christ , with Saint Peter on one side and Saint Gregory on the other . = = = Interior = = = The arcades are in six bays , the piers on the north arcade differing from those on the south . The roof is ceiled and divided into panels , with gilt bosses at the intersections . It is the only medieval nave roof in Suffolk to be ceiled and panelled in its original form . Some of Bodley 's painting remains on the chancel arch . In the south aisle is the octagonal 15th-century font . This was removed from the church in the 17th century to be used as a horse trough , but was returned to the church when the horses refused to drink from it . In the chancel the reredos designed by Bodley measures 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) high by 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) wide , and depicts the Crucifixion . On the sides of the chancel are 15th-century screens . In the Lady Chapel the font is carved with a depiction of the Nativity , and the reredos is a copy of Leonardo da Vinci 's Last Supper . Over the north and south doors are paintings of Moses and Aaron . These were painted by Robert Cardinall , and formerly hung in a position flanking the reredos at the east end of the church . The lectern , pulpit and altar are Victorian , as is the stained glass . The three-manual organ was built in 1911 by T. C. Lewis . It was renovated in 1942 by Henry Willis & Sons , and rebuilt in 1987 by Bishop . A major rebuild was carried out by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1999 . There is a ring of ten bells , the oldest three being cast in about 1470 , and the most recent two in 1978 .",

                    "text": "All Saints ' Church , Southampton = All Saints ' Church was a church building in Southampton City Centre , located on the corner of the High Street and East Street , a short distance south of the Bargate . The original church on the site was named All Hallows , and was constructed in medieval times on land granted by the monarch at the time , Henry II , to the monks of St. Denys Priory . This building fell into disrepair and in the 1790s a new church building was constructed and the church renamed to All Saints . The old church was demolished in 1791 and the new building was completed in 1795 , following two acts of Parliament allowing trustees of the church to raise funds from rates on property and rents in the parish . The All Hallows catacombs were incorporated into the All Saints building , and a separate graveyard was established . The church was regularly attended by author Jane Austen while she lived in Southampton and painter Sir John Everett Millais was baptised there . A new organ was installed in the church in 1861 and a substantial refurbishment programme took place in 1872 . All Saints was heavily damaged in the Southampton Blitz and was subsequently demolished . The All Saints building was designed by architect Willey Reveley and featured an arched ceiling that spanned the whole sanctuary , some 90 feet ( 27 m ) long and 60 feet ( 18 m ) wide , without the use of any supporting pillars . The neoclassical frontage of the church was dominated by four columns supporting Grecian pilasters and a triangular pediment . The catacombs were the resting place of a chancellor of the Exchequer and two notable Royal Navy officers among others . In August 1944 the remains of all 403 people buried in the catacombs were transferred to a communal grave elsewhere in Southampton . = = History = = = = = 12th to 17th century = = = Henry II , king of England from 1154 to 1189 , granted land for the construction of All Hallows ' Church to the monks of St. Denys Priory during his reign . The original church , located on the corner of the High Street and East Street , a short distance south of the Bargatehad a chancel and nave with north aisle , and a tower in three stages at its western end . The parish registers date from 1653 . The Great Ejection of 1662 led to a number of people being ejected from All Hallows , and these went on to form what would become Above Bar Church and Avenue St Andrew 's United Reformed Church . Among their number was the rector of the church at the time , Nathaniel Robinson . The church had five bells , but three of them were stolen one night in September 1682 and never found , despite an award being offered by the Mayor of Southampton , John Speed , in the London Gazette . = = = 18th century = = = By 1791 the medieval church of All Hallows had fallen into disrepair , and an act of Parliament ( the All Saints Church , Southampton Act of 1791 ) was passed with provision to demolish the existing structure and rebuild the parish church , and to purchase land for a church yard . The old building , which the Act described as \" very ancient , and in a very decayed and ruinous condition \" , was demolished that year . Work begun on the replacement church , All Saints , in the spring of 1792 , with the foundation stone being laid on 3 August that year . In addition to replacing the previous building , a number of neighbouring houses were demolished to make way for the new church . The building was designed by John Reveley , better known as Willey Reveley , an architect who had been a pupil of Sir William Chambers . Reveley complained in 1795 regarding the late payment of his bills , stating that the committee overseeing the construction of the church owed him \u00a3 1000 . Writing about Reveley 's design for All Saints ' , Dr Frank Salmon of Cambridge University said \" the church in Southampton was probably his most important building \" and John Nichols , who authored Reveley 's obituary in The Gentleman 's Magazine , described it as \" his principal work \" . However , in a 1861 history of Hampshire , the building is described as \" wholly without interest \" . Nichols related that the finished building was substantially different to Reveley 's original intentions , stating : The foundation stone was laid by the Provincial Grand Master of the Freemasons , Thomas Dunckerley , and the ceremony was also attended by the poet laureate , Henry Pye , who wrote an ode for the ceremony . The Mayor of Southampton and other dignitaries were also in attendance . The powers awarded to the church 's trustees in the 1791 act for fundraising proved insufficient and another act ( the All Saints Church , Southampton Act of 1793 ) was passed two years later to remedy this . The 1793 legislation 's introduction reported that the demolition had been completed and construction of the new building was under way . The 1791 act allowed the trustees to borrow up to \u00a3 5000 , and to collect rates on property and rents in the parish of up to one shilling in each pound . The 1793 act allowed them to raise an additional \u00a3 4000 among other provisions . The building was completed in 1795 . The catacombs of the original church remained intact and were incorporated into the new building . This underground cemetery reached slightly beyond the footprint of the actual building , extending under a portion of the High Street itself . In addition to the catacombs , a separate graveyard was established , located south of East Street on Back of the Walls ( another Southampton street ) . This location was technically outside of the All Saints ' parish boundary . The first rector of the new church was Richard Mant , who preached a sermon when the building was consecrated in that year . In the sermon , Mant made comments which were seen as an abusive attack on the \" dissenters \" \u2013 that is , those Christians who did not exclusively use the Church of England 's prescribed forms of prayer \u2013 and this prompted a detailed written response from William Kingsbury , the minister of an independent church in Southampton . Kingsbury 's letter sparked a response from Brian Monckhouse of Oxford , which in turn led to much further debate and publications on the matter including a \" pastoral charge \" by the Bishop of Salisbury . Mant 's son , also called Richard , had been born in Southampton in 1776 and went on to become a bishop . A further act of Parliament was passed in 1797 , after the new building had been constructed and furnished , allowing the trustees to raise up to \u00a3 4000 more and increasing the percentage they could collect from properties in the parish to one shilling and sixpence in the pound . = = = 19th century = = = In the early 19th century , novelist Jane Austen lived in the parish and regularly attended the church , mentioning it occasionally in her correspondence . In her letters she noted in January 1809 that she and her family had been unable to attend for two consecutive Sundays but despite the third Sunday being \" very blowing \" they did manage to attend that week . Painter Sir John Everett Millais , born in 1829 , was baptised in the church . The Law Commission estimate that the last debt relating to the construction of the building would have been paid by 1840 . By 1843 the graveyard was full , and it was closed around 1885 . The church 's single bell dated from 1828 and was manufactured by Warner of London . The rectory , which had been located in East Street since the fifteenth century , was sold in 1858 and a new one purchased , in Anglesea Place . A new organ was installed in the church three years later . The organ was manufactured by Bevington and Son and consisted of three tiers : a great with 11 stops , a swell with ten stops , and a choir organ with five stops . July 1872 saw a substantial refurbishment programme take place , with the original ceiling of the main sanctuary being completely replaced . The original plaster ceiling was removed with the new one constructed from wood , resulting in a weight reduction of 25 tons . The scheme cost \u00a3 1,900 . = = = 20th and 21st centuries = = = In 1914 the graveyard was formally deconsecrated and the headstones were removed from the site , which became a children 's playground in the 1930s and subsequently a multi-storey car park . The church was damaged beyond repair in a German bombing raid in December 1940 . In August 1944 , the human remains housed in the catacombs were transferred to Hollybrook Cemetery in Southampton where they were reburied in a single communal grave . In all , the remains of 403 people were transferred , some fairly well preserved in their oak coffins with leaden shells , but others had disintegrated completely . The ruins of the church building were subsequently demolished \u2013 sources do not indicate exactly when \u2013 and replaced by shops and a multi-storey car park . The parish registers were successfully retrieved from the ruin and , despite being charred and damaged by candle wax and molten tar ( the results of a fire that followed the bombing ) , they have been restored . Despite the debts related to the costs for the construction of the building having been settled in the early-mid 19th century , and the church ceasing to exist 100 years later , the three acts of Parliament allowing trustees of the church to levy rates on properties in the parish for the purpose of settling those debts remained in force and untouched until the Law Commission proposed their repeal in July 2014 , with a view to presenting recommendations to Parliament in 2015 . = = Architecture = = = = = Exterior = = = The frontage measured 60 feet 6 inches ( 18.44 m ) wide and had four columns which measured 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) in diameter by 36 feet ( 11 m ) high .

The lower part of the three spaces between the four pillars were filled with wide arches , with the entrance doors topped with fanlights below them . The building had staircases on each side , lit by semi-circular headed windows between the outer columns and the pilaster . There was an entablature around the building supported by similar pilasters to those atop the columns . The south side of the building , which faced East Street , had two rows of eight windows ; each window was 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) wide , with the upper windows 13 feet ( 4.0 m ) high and the bottom row 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) high . The north side had no windows because it adjoined the neighbouring buildings . On the east end of the roof , the church had a cupola which was topped with a large concrete pineapple . Pineapples were a feature of several buildings in Southampton as a symbol of welcome , an idea that originated in the Caribbean and which possibly reached the city as a result of the slave trade in the 16th century .

                    "text": "Uppsala Cathedral = Uppsala Cathedral ( Swedish : Uppsala domkyrka ) is a cathedral located between Uppsala University and the River Fyris in the centre of Uppsala , southeastern Sweden . Controlled by the Lutheran Church of Sweden , Uppsala Cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Uppsala , the primate of Sweden . The archbishop is Antje Jackel\u00e9n and the current bishop is Ragnar Persenius . The cathedral dates to the late 13th century and at a height of 118.7 metres ( 389 ft ) , it is the tallest church in the Nordic countries . Originally built under Roman Catholicism , it was used for coronations of Swedish monarchs for a lengthy period following the Protestant Reformation . Several of its chapels were converted to house the tombs of Swedish monarchs , including Gustav Vasa and John III . Carl Linnaeus , Olaus Rudbeck , Emanuel Swedenborg , and several archbishops are also buried here . The church was designed in the French Gothic style by French architects including \u00c9tienne de Bonneuil . It is in the form of a cross formed by the nave and transept . Most of the structure was built between 1272 and 1420 but the western end was completed only in the middle of the 15th century . Twin towers were built shortly afterwards on the west end of the church . High spires were added later , but after a fire in 1702 , they were adorned with low helms by Carl H\u00e5rleman in 1735 . They were completely redesigned by Helgo Zetterwall who undertook substantial changes to the building in the 1880s . The cathedral 's principal construction material is brick but the pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone . The vaults were all built according to the original 13th-century plan although some of them were erected as late as around 1440 . In addition to the artwork in the funeral chapels , several of the church 's older furnishings can be seen in the Treasury Museum . In 1702 , many features were destroyed in a major fire . During the renovation work carried out in the 1970s , many of the medieval frescoes which had been whitewashed over after the Reformation were uncovered and restored . = = History = = At the end of the Viking Era , the pagan temple at Gamla Uppsala ( Old Uppsala ) , about 5 kilometres ( 3.1 mi ) to the north of today 's Uppsala , was replaced by a Christian church . Although the exact date of its construction is not known , in 1123 Siward was ordained Bishop of Uppsala by the Archbishop of Bremen-Hamburg . It is however uncertain if Siward ever assumed office , as he had been expelled and was in Germany in the early 1130s . The catalogue of bishops mentions Severeinus as the first bishop , and he may have been the replacement for Siward . Henrik , \u2018 Finland 's Apostle \u2019 , was the fourth bishop . In 1164 , Sweden became an archbishopric under the control of Lund . The first archbishop was the Cistercian monk Stefan of Alvastra . After the cathedral in Gamla Uppsala was damaged by fire in 1204 , the Chapter sought permission from the Holy See to move the building to a larger site . Pope Alexander IV granted this request in 1258 on condition that the name of Uppsala be maintained . At a meeting in S\u00f6derk\u00f6ping in September 1270 , Archbishop Fulco Angelus and the cathedral chapter decided the site should be in \u00d6stra Aros . Formal authorization of the move was issued in 1271 by Bishop Carolus of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s whom the Pope had appointed to oversee the case . About 1272 , work began on building a new cathedral in \u00d6stra Aros near the Fyris River to the south . It was constructed on the site of the earlier stone church dedicated to the Holy Trinity , located almost exactly where the cathedral 's chancel now stands . It was here that Sweden 's patron saint Eric Jedvardsson had attended mass before he was murdered in 1160 . The name of Uppsala was kept , and the surrounding town \u00d6stra Aros soon changed its name accordingly . The relics of Saint Eric , the treasure of Uppsala , were moved from Gamla Uppsala to the new site in 1273 , along with the formal move of the archbishopric . The church was designed by French architects although the name of the author of the detailed initial plans who supervised work until 1281 has not been recorded . In 1287 , a promissory note drawn up by the provost of Paris covers the expenses to be incurred by master builder \u00c9tienne de Bonneuil and his assistants in travelling to Sweden to work on the construction of a cathedral at Uppsala . \u00c9tienne is credited with work at the east and south chapels of the chancel , the transepts and probably the south portal , although in most of his work he appears to have meticulously followed the plans of his predecessor . Progress was slow as a result of the cold climate , the plague and many financial difficulties . It was not until the end of the 14th century that work on the initial plans was completed , thanks in particular to the contribution of the master builder Nikolaus fr\u00e5n V\u00e4ster\u00e5s who began construction of the nave . When consecrated in 1435 by Archbishop Olaus Laurentii , the cathedral still was not complete . It was dedicated to Saint Lawrence , highly cherished in all of Sweden at that time ; Saint Eric , the patron saint of Sweden ( though never canonised by the Roman Catholic Church ) ; and Saint Olaf , the patron saint of Norway . It was completed over the following decades . Although there are no documentary records of the consecration , there are several references from the same period to the cathedral 's chapels , including their altars which were dedicated to the Holy Cross , to the Virgin Mary or to other saints . The last main component of the cathedral , the towers , were built between 1470 and 1489 . The cathedral was damaged by fire on several occasions , especially during the great fire of 1702 which destroyed much of the city . Restoration work was not completed until the middle of the century . The church was not the regular place of worship of laypeople until the Reformation . It was reserved for official services of the Catholic Church hierarchy ( by the cathedral 's canons ) . The parish churches in Uppsala were the Holy Trinity Church or Bondkyrkan , \u2018 Peasant Church \u2019 , as it was often called ; Church of Saint Peter ; Church of Our Lady ; and a Franciscan friary . The last three had been built on the east side of the Fyris River , which was the central business district , and remains so to date . They were successively torn down during the Reformation . The Cathedral was also the coronation church for many of Sweden 's kings and queens until 1719 . It was the site of celebrating coronations from the Middle Ages until the end of the 17th century . Stockholm 's Cathedral Storkyrkan became the official coronation church . From 1885 to 1893 , the architect Helgo Zettervall ( 1831-1907 ) undertook comprehensive restoration work , seeking to give the cathedral a French High Gothic appearance although he has been criticized for not respecting the building 's original Baltic Gothic style . He also added pointed French spires to the towers , bringing the cathedral up to a height of 118.7 m ( 389 ft ) , so making it as high as it was long . In an attempt to give the cathedral a slimmer appearance , Zettervall significantly altered large portions of the medieval outer brick walls and removed the decorative white-washed \u2018 blind windows \u2019 on the gables which had been similar to those on the nearby Holy Trinity Church . Further renovation work in the early 1970s led to improvements in the building 's structure and included restoration of the walls and windows . Large portions of cement additions by Zettervall to the exterior structure of the cathedral were removed decades later as they adversely affected the building 's fabric . In 1989 , Pope John Paul II took part in an ecumenical service in Uppsala Cathedral with Archbishop Bertil Werkstr\u00f6m . Fire protection equipment was installed in 2010 and the electrical and heating systems have been replaced . = = Architecture = = The cathedral is the tallest church building in Scandinavia . Its height of 118.7 m ( 389 ft ) is the same as its length while it has a breadth of 45 m ( 148 ft ) . The height inside is 27 metres ( 89 ft ) . The church was designed in the French High Gothic style by French master builders including \u00c9tienne de Bonneuil . Built high on a gravel ridge southwest of the River Fyris , its Latin cross ground plan consists of a three-aisled basilica ( a central nave flanked by two lateral aisles ) with single-aisle transepts , and a four-bay chancel with an ambulatory surrounded by five chapels . The seven-bay nave is bordered by chantry chapels on either side . Starting with the eastern end of the church and the chapels surrounding the chancel , most of the structure was built between 1270 and 1420 but the western end of the nave was completed only in the middle of the 15th century while the towers took decades more to complete . The principal material is red brick but the cathedral was built on a stone foundation and the chancel pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone . ( The nave pillars were originally of brick but were replaced with limestone as part of the restoration work carried out under Helgo Zettervall from 1885 to 1893 . ) The twin towers at the west end of the church were first mentioned in 1563 . Several additions to both the interior and exterior of the church were made after a fire in 1572 under the leadership of Franciscus Pahr , known for his work on castles . The turret and pinnacles which can be seen in older drawings were added as well as the first spires on the west towers which were designed by Antonius Watz . In the 1690s , Nicodemus Tessin designed a new burial chapel to the east of the south transept , the most significant alteration to the plan of the cathedral since the Middle Ages . From the outside , his design respected the traditions of medieval architecture with tall Gothic windows but the interior was decorated in Tessin 's usual Classical Baroque style . In the 17th century , the towers were redesigned in the Dutch Renaissance style but after the serious fire of 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops . At the same time , the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look conveyed by pictures of the period . Only in 1740 were copper-faced spires installed , designed by Carl H\u00e5rleman . At the same time , H\u00e5rleman carried out significant work on the west fa\u00e7ade . Today 's towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s , substantially increasing their height . After the serious fire of 1702 , the original flying buttresses were removed and a higher roof was built . Although the cathedral was designed by French architects , it exhibits a number of differences from the cathedrals of northern France . Above all , it is essentially constructed of brick rather than stone . Brick could easily be produced locally but stone had to be imported from the distant quarries of Gotland . As bricks and mortar are not as strong as stone , the walls had to be thicker although the pillars needed to support the vaulted ceiling of the chancel were made of limestone ( although those in the nave are of brick ) . The north transept portal is also built of limestone , no doubt as it was needed to support the rose window , also structured in limestone itself . While the chancel and the transept are clearly of French design , the nave which was built somewhat later displays German and Swedish characteristics . Constructed in about 1330 , the rose window over the northeast portal is still entirely French . Nicolaus from V\u00e4ster\u00e5s , the Swede who directed work on the nave from the 1360s , appears to have slightly modified the original plans , adding confessional side-chapels and including a few features of German origin . It is interesting to note that cross-vaults were nevertheless installed , rather than star-shaped vaults which were more common at the time . Work on the western end of the building began in 1431 with the construction of the west portal which was influenced by the style of Vadstena Abbey . The towers , however , still exhibited features typical of 13th-century French architecture , indicating that the original plans were still in use at the time . Overall , despite minor differences , Uppsala Cathedral still reflects the style of the 13th-century cathedrals of northern France . = = Interior = = The Coronation Vault stands 27 m ( 89 ft ) above the point at which the transept crosses the nave . It is where most of Sweden 's monarchs were crowned from the Middle Ages until 1719 . During the restoration in the 1880s , the interior ceiling and walls of the cathedral were decorated in the Neo-Gothic style . Some depictions , such as one of the Reformation 's Martin Luther , added figures beyond the cathedral 's medieval heritage . During the renovation work carried out in the 1970s , many of the medieval frescoes which had been whitewashed over after the Reformation were uncovered and restored . The high altar is used for the cathedral 's services on the most important feast days in the church calendar . It is also here that all Swedish bishops are ordained . The silver chandelier is from 1647 . The large crucifix in silver and crystal from Orrefors was installed in 1976 . = = = Chapels = = = The cathedral 's largest chapel , the Vasa Chapel , at the eastern end of the chancel , was originally known as the Chapel of the Virgin Mary . It later became a burial monument for Gustav Vasa and his family . Completed in 1583 , it is decorated with the national arms of Sweden as well as with some of the oldest known Swedish and Finnish coats of arms . The Finsta Chapel or St Eric 's Chapel on the north-west corner of the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy , the patron saint of Sweden , who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later built . His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building . In 1580 , King John III melted his shrine down but replaced it with a new gold-plated one which still contains Eric 's relics and crown . The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born . They were entombed in the chapel in 1328 . A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small gold-plated shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990 . Next to the Finsta Chapel , the Sture Chapel is the memorial tomb of the three members of the Sture family who were murdered in by King Eric XIV in 1567 . The reredos ( 1520 ) depicts the story of Mary 's parents , Anne and Joachim . At the end of the 16th century , the church 's sacristy was converted into a burial chapel for Queen Catherine Jagellon or Katarina Jagellonica , the wife of King John III , who is also entombed there . The Jagellonica Chapel takes its name from her . The monument , crowned by a marble vault , was designed by Willem Boy . = = = Windows = = = Several windows maintain their original shape and size . The original stained-glass decorations were almost all lost in the 1702 fire and were simply replaced by normal glass . The current stained-glass designs were added during the renovation at the end of the 19th century , most of them by the Gothenburg firm , Svenska Glasm\u00e5leri . The large windows above the portals depict the Trinity : God the Father over the west door , God the Son above the south door ( the largest in the church ) , and God the Holy Spirit above the north door . Crafted in limestone , the rose window at the north portal is the oldest , unchanged since the 13th century . = = = Treasury and artefacts = = = Located in the north tower , the cathedral Treasury Museum displays a number of gold and silver articles used in the religious services . There is also a collection of textiles including Queen Margaret 's golden gown . The burial regalia of Gustav Vasa , John III and their wives can also be seen . Other artefacts in the cathedral include tapestries in the Chapel of Remembrance from 1976 which record important events in the cathedral 's history . The ornate pulpit ( 1710 ) , the largest in Sweden , was designed by Nicodemus Tessin and carved by Burchard Precht . It was a gift from Queen Hedvig Eleonora after the fire of 1702 . Decorations include John the Baptist preaching in the desert , Saint Paul in Athens and the parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard . One of the new bells installed after the devastating fire of 1702 is called Thornan . It was taken from Toru\u0144 , Poland as war booty in 1703 by the Swedish forces of Carl XII during the Great Northern War . In the Vasa Chapel , there are seven large fresco paintings executed by Johan Gustaf Sandberg ( 1782 \u2013 1854 ) over a period of several years . They depict important events in the life of Gustav Vasa . One of the most famous is Talet till dalkarlarna vid Mora kyrka ( Speech to the people of Dalarna outside Mora Church ) . Frescos also decorate the vaults of the nave . Initially , as in some of the continental cathedrals , the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components . Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes . In the 15th century , frescos of figures in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted in various parts of the church . Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf . Unfortunately , they have now been heavily restored . The frescos in the chancel were probably painted by Albertus Pictor 's workshop . = = Interred notables = = A number of Swedish monarchs and other notable people were buried inside the cathedral : Gustav Vasa , 16th-century King of Sweden . Nearly a decade before his death , he had expressed a wish to be buried in the cathedral . He is buried with his three wives , although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy . The king and his wives are interred in what was once the Chapel of the Virgin Mary . The only remaining indication of the original intention of the chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling , symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition . John III ( died 1592 ) , the second son of Gustav Vasa , and his second wife Gunilla Bielke are also buried in the Virgin Mary Chapel . His first wife , Catherine Jagiellon from Poland , has a burial chapel of her own on the north side of the chancel . Princess Elizabeth ( died 1597 ) , Gustav Vasa 's youngest daughter is buried in the Finsta Chapel adjacent to Virgin Mary 's Chapel . The noblemen Svante Sture ( 1517 \u2013 1567 ) and his sons Nils ( 1543 \u2013 1567 ) and Erik ( 1546 \u2013 1567 ) who were all killed by Erik XIV in the Sture Murders are entombed in the Sture Chapel . The clothes they were wearing at the time of their death are displayed in the Treasury Museum . Carl Linnaeus ( 1707 \u2013 1778 ) , the 18th-century world-famous botanist and professor at Uppsala University , has a memorial designed by Tobias Sergel next to the Chapel of Remembrance . Olaus Rudbeck , Swedish polymath and one of the discoverers of the lymphatic system . Emanuel Swedenborg , 18th-century scientist and mystic . He was not originally interred here , but his remains were transported to Uppsala from England in 1908 . Nathan S\u00f6derblom ( 1866 \u2013 1931 ) , archbishop of Uppsala and Nobel Peace Prize recipient . His tomb is at the foot of the steps to the high altar . Eric the Saint , 12th-century king and national saint , whose relics are in the Finsta Chapel . Laurentius Petri ( 1499 \u2013 1573 ) , Sweden 's first Lutheran archbishop , buried at the foot of the altar steps . Relics of Saint Bridget or Heliga Birgitta ( 1303 \u2013 1373 ) have been placed in a shrine in the Finsta Chapel inspired by the clothing of the Saint Bridget Order .

It is located close to Edzell , and is around 5 miles ( 8 km ) north of Brechin , in Angus , Scotland . Edzell Castle was begun around 1520 by David Lindsay , 9th Earl of Crawford , and expanded by his son , Sir David Lindsay , Lord Edzell , who also laid out the garden in 1604 . The castle saw little military action , and was , in its design , construction and use , more of a country house than a defensive structure . It was briefly occupied by English troops during Oliver Cromwell 's invasion of Scotland in 1651 . In 1715 it was sold by the Lindsay family , and eventually came into the ownership of the Earl of Dalhousie . It was given into state care in the 1930s , and is now a visitor attraction run by Historic Scotland ( open all year ; entrance charge ) . The castle consists of the original tower house and building ranges around a courtyard . The adjacent Renaissance walled garden , incorporating intricate relief carvings , is unique in Scotland . It was replanted in the 1930s , and is considered to have links to esoteric traditions , including Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry . = = History = = = = = Origins = = = The first castle at Edzell was a timber motte and bailey structure , built to guard the mouth of Glenesk , a strategic pass leading north into the Highlands . The motte , or mound , is still visible 300 metres ( 980 ft ) south-west of the present castle , and dates from the 12th century . It was the seat of the Abbott , or Abbe , family , and was the centre of the now vanished original village of Edzell . The Abbotts were succeeded as lords of Edzell by the Stirlings of Glenesk , and the Stirlings in turn by the Lindsays . In 1358 , Sir Alexander de Lindsay , third son of David Lindsay of Crawford , married the Stirling heiress , Katherine Stirling . Alexander 's son , David , was created Earl of Crawford in 1398 . Edzell became the property of a junior branch of the Lindsay family descended from the 3rd Earl , and in 1513 it was inherited by David Lindsay ( d . 1558 ) . Around 1520 , David Lindsay decided to abandon the original castle , and built a tower house and barmkin , or courtyard , in a more sheltered location nearby . The selection of a site overlooked by higher ground to the north suggests that defence was not the primary concern . David became the Earl of Crawford in 1542 , on the death of his cousin the 8th Earl , who had disinherited his own son Alexander , the \" Wicked Master \" . He proceeded to extend the simple tower house , in around 1550 , by the addition of a large west range , incorporating a new entrance gate and hall . Lord Crawford also built Invermark Castle , 12 miles ( 19 km ) north of Edzell , possibly as a hunting lodge , at around the same time . = = = Sir David Lindsay , Lord Edzell = = = David Lindsay , the 9th Earl 's son , was educated in Paris and Cambridge , and travelled in continental Europe . His father had nominated the son of Alexander , the Wicked Master , as heir to the earldom , returning the title to the senior line of the family , and thus Lindsay did not succeed to the earldom on his father 's death . However , he was knighted in 1581 , became a Lord of Session ( a senior judge ) , taking the title Lord Edzell , in 1593 , and in 1598 was appointed to the Privy Council . A Renaissance Man , he undertook improvements to his estates , including mining and woodland planting . Two German prospectors from Nuremberg , Bernard Fechtenburg and Hans Ziegler , were invited to search for precious metals around Edzell . In August 1562 , David Lindsay received Mary , Queen of Scots , at Edzell . The Queen was on a Royal progress , with the aim of subduing the rebellious Earl of Huntly , and spent two nights at Edzell . During her stay she convened a meeting of the Privy Council , attended by the nobility of Scotland . Her son , King James VI , visited Edzell twice ; on 28 June 1580 , and in August 1589 . Sir David further extended the castle in the late 16th century , with the addition of a large north range with round corner towers . He laid out the garden in 1604 , with symbols of England , Scotland and Ireland , to celebrate the Union of the Crowns of the previous year , when James VI acceeded to the English throne on the death of his cousin , Elizabeth I. Sir David died in 1610 , heavily in debt as a result of fines handed down for the unruly conduct of his son , and with both the garden and the north range incomplete . = = = Damage and decline = = = Edzell was not affected by the campaigns of the Royalist Marquess of Montrose in the 1640s , although other properties of the Covenanting Presbyterian David Lindsay ( son of Sir David ) , were attacked . During the Third English Civil War , Oliver Cromwell invaded Scotland and , in September 1651 , his troops took Edzell , and were stationed there for one month . By the time of the Presbyterian settlement of 1689 , the Lord of Edzell , David 's son John Lindsay , had switched allegiances from Presbyterianism to Episcopalianism . Along with the parish minister , he was barred from the parish church , and Episcopal services were held in the great hall at Edzell . The castle began to decline around the time of the 1715 Jacobite Rising . The last Lindsay lord of Edzell , another David , was a Jacobite , a supporter of the exiled James Stuart , the \" Old Pretender \" . Faced with mounting family debts , David sold the castle to the 4th Earl of Panmure , a fellow Jacobite , for \u00a3 192,502 Scots , equivalent to \u00a3 16,042 sterling . Lord Panmure , however , forfeited his lands and property for taking part in the failed rebellion . Edzell was sold , by the Crown , to the York Buildings Company , a London waterworks company which had branched into the buying and selling of forfeited property . They proceeded to \" asset strip \" the property . The castle saw its last military event in 1746 , when a unit of government troops , of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders , occupied the building , causing further damage . By 1764 , the York Buildings Company was bankrupt , and the remaining contents of the castle , including the roofs , were removed and sold to pay the company 's creditors . The avenue of beech trees , which linked the castle and the village , was felled , and the property was sold to William Maule , Earl Panmure , nephew of the attainted Earl of Panmure . He died in 1782 , and the property passed to his nephew , George Ramsay , 8th Earl of Dalhousie . = = = Later history = = = The castle remained the property of the earls of Dalhousie , who appointed a caretaker from the 1870s , and built a cottage for him in 1901 , which is now in use as a visitor centre . In 1932 , the walled garden passed into state care , followed by the rest of the castle in 1935 . The castle and garden are currently maintained by Historic Scotland and are open to the public year round . The motte and castle are protected as Scheduled Ancient Monuments , while the castle is also a Category A listed building , the highest level of protection for an historic building , and the garden is included in the Inventory of Historic Gardens and Designed Landscapes , the national listing of significant gardens . The caretaker 's house is a Category B listed building . = = Description = = = = = The motte = = = The motte , still known as Castlehillock , is the only remainder of the first Edzell Castle . It lies 300m south-west of the later castle , by a bend in the West Water , and comprises a low , partially natural mound . The motte is aligned north-west to south-east , and is around 36 metres ( 118 ft ) long by 16 metres ( 52 ft ) across at its broadest point , and around 4 metres ( 13 ft ) high . An outer bailey , or courtyard , up to 61 metres ( 200 ft ) across formerly surrounded the motte , and was bordered by a deep ditch . = = = The castle = = = The castle comprises the early 16th-century tower house , the slightly later west range , and the late 16th-century north range . Other buildings to the east and south have now vanished . The red sandstone walls were originally harled . The four-storey tower house was named the Stirling Tower after the original lords of Edzell , the Stirlings of Glenesk , although it is not old enough to have been built by them . It is 16 metres ( 52 ft ) high , and measures 13 metres ( 43 ft ) by 10 metres ( 33 ft ) on plan . The walls are over 2 metres ( 6.6 ft ) thick at the basement , narrowing to 1.5 metres ( 4.9 ft ) on the first floor . The tower house is entered from the north , via a door protected by \" inverted keyhole \" shaped gun holes . A slot adjacent to the door would have held a draw-bar , to reinforce the entry , and several mason 's marks remain around the door . The hall occupies the first floor , above two vaulted cellars . Marks in the wall show the position of a minstrels ' gallery and a timber screen , which concealed a serving area accessed via a narrow stair from the cellar . The broad main spiral stair led up to three further storeys of private chambers , before reaching a caphouse , a small rooftop chamber giving access to a parapet walk . The four corners of the tower have bartizans , or open turrets , and similar projections occur halfway along each wall . The parapet is supported on projecting stones , or corbels , arranged in a pattern of two tiers which alternate , rendering the lower tier purely decorative . Edzell represents an early occurrence of this style , known as chequered corbelling , which became more widespread later in the 16th century . The two-storey west range contains the main entrance , which enters the courtyard via an arched passage . Above the outside gate are spaces where armorial panels were once displayed . The windows on this front , larger than the original ones in the tower house , had iron grilles , and small gun holes beneath them . Beside the entrance was a kitchen , and above , a larger hall and drawing room . Only the western part of the three-storey north range was completed , although the Lindsays planned to complete the courtyard . This range had another kitchen , as well as private chambers within the round tower at the north-west corner . It was entered via a stair turret in the courtyard , fragments of which remain , including parts of an intricately carved door surround . Only the foundations of the east and south buildings remain , which probably contained a bakehouse and stables . = = The walled garden = = In addition to extending the castle , Sir David Lindsay also created Edzell 's most unusual feature , the walled garden , or \" Pleasaunce \" . Similar gardens were probably relatively common in Scotland during the Renaissance , but Edzell is a rare survivor . The garden would have provided a retreat from the castle , and was intended to delight , entertain , and instruct Sir David 's distinguished guests . It was started around 1604 , and shows signs of being hastily completed at his death in 1610 . It is a rectangular enclosure some 52 metres ( 171 ft ) north to south , and 43.5 metres ( 143 ft ) east to west , surrounded by a 3.6 metres ( 12 ft ) high wall . The north wall is part of the castle courtyard , but the remaining three are intricately decorated . The walls are divided by pilasters ( now removed ) into regular sections , or compartments , each 3 metres ( 9.8 ft ) across . Each compartment has a niche above , possibly once containing statues . Those on the east wall have semi-circular pediments carved with scrolls , and with the national symbols of thistle , fleur-de-lis , shamrock and rose , recalling the Union of the Crowns of England and Scotland , under James VI in 1603 . The pediments on the south wall are square , while there are no niches on the west wall , indicating that work may have prematurely come to a halt on Sir David 's death . Below the niches , the compartments are of alternating design . Three sets of seven carved panels occupy every other compartment . Between them , the walls are decorated with a representation of the Lindsay coat of arms , with eleven recesses in the form of a fess chequy , or chequered band , surmounted by three seven-pointed stars , taken from the Stirling of Glenesk arms . Several spaces within the walls , including inside the stars , may have been intended as nesting holes for birds . = = = The carved panels = = = The sets of carved panels depict the seven Cardinal Virtues on the west wall , the seven Liberal Arts to the south , and the seven Planetary Deities on the east wall . Each panel is approximately 1 metre ( 3.3 ft ) high by 60 \u2013 75 cm ( 2-2 \u00bd ft ) wide . The deities are depicted in vesica-shaped ( elliptical ) frames , the arts under arches , and the virtues in plain rectangles . W. Douglas Simpson describes the arts panels as the weakest set of carvings , again suggesting money was short for the west wall . He declared the arts panels to be the finest work , and compares the style of the deities to contemporary carvings found in Aberdeenshire , suggesting that the mason responsible may have come from there . The carvings are all based on popular series of engravings , which were often published in pattern books . Nuremberg was the origin of numerous such books , and one may have been brought to Edzell by the miner Hans Ziegler . Specifically , the images of the deities are derived from engravings of 1528 \u2013 29 by the German artist Georg Pencz ( or Iorg Bentz , c . 1500 \u2013 1550 ) , a pupil of Albrecht D\u00fcrer ; the initials I. B. appear on the carving of Mars . The arts and virtues are both based on engravings derived from paintings by the Flemish artist Marten de Vos . The engravings , by Jan Sadeler and Crispijn de Passe , were widely distributed in Scotland , along with those of the deities . Indeed , the image of Prudence is identical to that used by the King 's Master of Works William Schaw , in the spectacular display to welcome Queen Anne to Scotland , following her marriage to James VI in 1589 . = = = Buildings and planting = = = To complement the garden , a bath house and summer house were constructed at the corners of the garden furthest from the castle . The bath house is ruined , but the two-storey summer house survives intact . It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room , with an upper chamber , containing the only surviving example of the castle \u2019 s carved-oak wall panelling . Charles McKean attributes the design and construction of the garden buildings to Thomas Leiper , an Aberdeenshire stonemason , based on the elaborately decorated gun holes in the summer house . The planting was recreated in the 1930s . No original plan of the renaissance garden survives , although records show fruit was grown in the 17th century . The garden has decorative hedges , trimmed into the shapes of the Scottish thistle , English rose , and French fleur-de-lis . Further planting is clipped into letters , spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes , Dum Spiro Spero ( while I breathe I hope ) , and Endure Forte ( endure firmly ) . = = = Interpretations = = = The symbolism of the garden , particularly of the carvings , as well as the repetition of sevens and threes , has inspired many interpretations . The engravings upon which the carvings are based were commonplace in Scotland at the time , and were frequently used in the art of memory , a mnemonic memory technique associated with Freemasonry . The art of memory had become a feature throughout Scottish culture , from the court of Queen Anne , Danish consort of James VI , to the lodges of operative stonemasons . The potential influence of Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe 's symbolic garden at Uraniborg , which was visited by James IV of Scotland in 1590 , has also been noted . Sir David Lindsay would have been well aware of the symbolic allusions of the carvings . In correspondence with his brother , Lord Menmuir , he discusses the relationship of the planets to the metals , which he had employed Hans Ziegler to search for on his land . Sir David 's nephew , David Lindsay , 1st Lord Balcarres , was noted for his interest in alchemy and the Rosicrucians . Historian Adam McLean has suggested that the garden is associated with the Rosicrucians , and \" should be seen as an early 17th-century Mystery Temple \" . McLean describes the garden as a place of instruction , and remarks that the whole structure is reminiscent of \" Eliphas Levi 's description of the ancient Tarot of the Egyptians carved into the walls of their initiation temples , to which the candidate was taken to contemplate the sequence of the symbols \" . He backs up this suggestion with the observation that the Mantegna Tarocchi , a set of 15th-century engravings formerly thought to be a tarocchi or tarot deck , includes all these images amongst its symbols .",

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building , and its architecture has been praised by a number of writers . It is possible that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era , although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman . The present ground plan was established in the 13th and 14th centuries , from which time the church 's external appearance dates , apart from a major rebuilding in the later part of the 15th century , when the range of high windows or clerestory was added . All styles of English Gothic architecture , are represented in the church : Early English , Decorated , and Perpendicular . During the civil war , a group of Roundheads stabled their horses in the church . In the 19th century the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott ; some wall paintings were revealed , and stained glass was added . The church has a number of special features . These include its exceptionally wide nave for a village church , and its trapezoidal shape . The tower is separate from the body of the church , joined to it by a passage with a porch . There are two other porches : the three-storey west porch and the two-storey south porch . Inside the church are medieval fittings and furniture and many memorials . The churchyard contains numerous gravestones from the 17th century and five listed structures , including a canopied tomb . St Mary 's continues to be an active church in the centre of its village . It provides the usual services of an Anglican church and runs a number of organisations catering for children and adults . = = History = = The origins of the church are unclear . The Domesday survey of 1086 records the presence of a priest at Astbury , but not a church . The discovery nearby of fragments of stone with apparent Saxon decoration , coffin lids , and the lower stages of a cross \u2013 all of which might date from before the Norman conquest \u2013 suggest that an earlier church may have been on the site . The earliest fabric in the present church is a round-arched doorway . Architectural historian Andor Gomme dates this from about the middle of the 12th century and states that at that time the church would have been a simple rectangular building , and mainly timber-framed . Gomme suggests further that in the middle of the 13th century the east end of the church would have been rebuilt in stone , with a chancel and sanctuary . Subsequently the rest of the body of the church was built , consisting of the nave and north and south aisles ; the work was completed in the 14th century . The tower was built towards the end of the 13th century , not in the usual position at the west end of the church but to the north of the west bay of the north aisle , separated from it by a distance of 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) . During the 14th century the south porch , with its priest 's room or treasury in the top storey , was added . It is not known whether the tower 's spire was built in the 14th or the 15th century . Major rebuilding work took place in the later part of the 15th century . It is thought that it began with the south arcade , followed by the north arcade and the addition of a clerestory . The rebuilding was probably complete by about 1525 , although the north aisle may not have been completely re-roofed until the early 17th century . The west porch was probably started in the 14th century , and the upper two storeys added in the following century . The nave roof was repaired in 1615 . During the civil war , while nearby Biddulph Hall was under siege , Sir William Brereton 's Roundheads stabled their horses in the church . They damaged the medieval glass windows and removed some of the church furniture , including the organ . There have been few significant changes since that time . The church was restored during the 19th century by Anthony Salvin , and later , in about 1857 , by George Gilbert Scott , who removed plaster from the walls and built a small gallery . During the Victorian era , the reredos and most of the stained glass were added . = = Architecture = = = = = Exterior = = = The body of the church is constructed in yellow sandstone ashlar , and the tower in millstone grit , an unusual material for churches in Cheshire . The architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor draws attention to the crispness of the details of the stonework in the tower 500 years after it was carved , compared to the sandstone , which is prone to weathering . The roof is metal . The church incorporates elements of Norman , Early English , Decorated , and Perpendicular architecture . The overall plan is that of a trapezium ; the west end is 8 feet ( 2.4 m ) wider than the east . The body of the church consists of a seven-bay nave and chancel with no structural division , and north and south aisles . The aisles are rectangular , thus the narrowing takes place entirely within the nave and chancel . The west end of the nave , between the piers ( columns ) of the arcades , is 40 feet ( 12.2 m ) wide . This is exceptionally wide for a parish church , and slightly wider than the nave of Chester Cathedral . The aisles extend along the sides of the chancel , forming north and south chapels . The tower stands to the north of the west bay of the body of the church , and is joined to it by a short passage with a porch on its east side . There are also porches on the west and south sides of the church . The tower is in three stages and is supported by buttresses . In the lowest stage , on the west side , is a doorway in Romanesque style , on the north side is an ogee-headed lancet window . On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch . The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side , above which is a circular clock face , and on the north and east sides are lancet windows . The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side . The parapet is plain , and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle . The spire is octagonal , with two tiers of lucarnes ( dormer windows ) . The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays . The second bay from the east contains a priest 's door , above which is a lancet window . To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window . The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery . Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory . The clerestory has seven bays on either side , each containing a four-light Perpendicular window . At the east end are three windows . The central window , at the end of the chancel , is Perpendicular with seven lights . This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery , the one to the right having four lights , and that to the left five lights . The southern side of the church has nine bays , again divided by buttresses . In the third bay from the west is a porch . The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads . The porch is in two storeys , with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles . The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch , and the upper storey has a two-light window . The doorway and window are set slightly to the west of the centre , as the east wall contains a stairway . Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups ( holy water fonts ) . The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones . On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial . The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style , and has five bays . At its centre is another porch , this one with three storeys . At the west front are diagonal buttresses , and in the bottom storey is a double doorway , over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint . In the middle storey is a three-light window , in the top storey a two-light window , and at the summit is a battlemented parapet . There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage , and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret . Inside the porch are four corbels ( supporting brackets ) carved with musicians . On each side of the porch is a four-light window . At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window , and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle . = = = Interior = = = The nave and chancel are divided from the aisles by seven-bay arcades , the piers being without capitals . At the top of each pier , facing the nave , is a carved human face . The roofs are divided into panels and contain much carving , including bosses ( protrusions ) , shields , inscriptions and three pendants . The chapel at the west end of the south aisle is known as the Lady Chapel , and that on the north side is dedicated to Saint Mary . The church contains more medieval fittings and furniture than any other Cheshire church . Between the nave and the chancel is a screen , and there are parclose screens between the aisles and the chapels . The chancel screen , dated 1500 , is elaborately carved with representations of birds , roses , vines and foliage . It has ten bays with lierne vaulting . The chancel stalls and the carved wooden eagle lectern date from around the same period . The lectern is one of the oldest eagle lecterns in the United Kingdom . The stalls have hinged seats , and formerly had misericords ( shelves to support a standing person ) . Much of the furniture dates from the 17th century and is in Jacobean style . This includes the altar rails , the octagonal pulpit , the box pews , the reredos ( screen behind the altar ) in the Lady Chapel , and the font cover . The font itself is Perpendicular . The reredos in the chancel of 1866 was designed by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther . The royal arms of Charles II are in the north aisle . During the 1852 restoration whitewash was removed from the walls , revealing the royal arms of Henry VII , and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George . Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500 . Other glass comes from the Victorian era . This includes the east window from about 1858 , and the window at the east end of the north aisle from about 1861 , both by William Warrington , and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes . The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O 'Connor and dated 1871 . There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel . In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with interlace decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11th century . There are 76 memorials in the church . These include the 14th-century tomb of Ralph Davenport with the recumbent figure of a knight wearing plate armour with a gorget ( collar ) of mail ( armour consisting of linked metal rings ) and a conical helmet , a tomb chest of 1654 , and a recumbent effigy ( statue ) of Lady Egerton , who died in 1599 . The church also contains two sanctuary chairs and six old chests , one of which is iron-bound and dates from the 13th century . There is a ring of eight bells , six of which were recast in 1925 by Taylor 's of Loughborough from the metal of the previous four 17th-century bells . The other two bells were added in 1998 and were also supplied by Taylors . The organ was made by J. J. Binns for King 's Hall , Stoke-on-Trent in 1912 . It was presented to the church by Stoke City Council in 1962 and was rebuilt and installed by Reeves and Merner . The parish registers begin in 1572 and the churchwardens ' accounts in 1711 , but the latter are incomplete . = = External features = = The churchyard contains 51 gravestones dating from the 17th century . The most important monument is the canopied tomb of a member of the Venables family , which dates from the late 13th century ; crocketed pinnacles on the canopy date from the 17th century . Formerly inside the church , the tomb contains two figures , male and female , with their hands clasped in prayer . The only one of its kind in Cheshire , it is listed Grade II * , and is a scheduled monument . There are two further notable memorials in the churchyard , one to the north and the other to the south of the Venables tomb . Both are in yellow sandstone , date from the medieval period , and include weathered recumbent effigies . The one to the north possibly depicts a cleric with his hands in prayer , and the one to the south is a knight in armour with a missing leg . The churchyard also contains a sundial , consisting of two octagonal steps that were originally the base of a 16th-century cross supporting an 18th-century octagonal pillar . In addition to being listed , it is also a scheduled monument . The gateway to the churchyard dates from the 17th century , and consists of a yellow sandstone arch with crocketed pinnacles and a battlemented parapet . All of these structures are listed as Grade II . The churchyard contains the war graves of 16 British servicemen , 15 of World War I , and one of World War II . A yew tree in the churchyard is believed to be over 1,000 years old . = = Assessment = = The church was designated on 14 February 1967 by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building . Grade I listing means that the building is acknowledged to be \" of exceptional interest , sometimes considered to be internationally important \" . The architectural historian Raymond Richards , writing in 1947 , considered it to be one of the most beautiful churches in the county . The authors of the Buildings of England series call it \" one of the most exciting Cheshire churches \" . Clifton-Taylor includes it in his list of \" outstanding \" English parish churches . = = Present day = = St Mary 's Church stands in an elevated position overlooking the village green on the south side of the village . It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester , the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Congleton . The church holds traditional Anglican services and activities for younger people on Sundays . It runs a Prayer Group , a Toddler Group , and groups for other ages of children . The church publishes a monthly parish magazine .",

                    "text": "All Saints Church , Patcham = All Saints Church is the Anglican parish church of Patcham , an ancient Sussex village which is now part of the English city of Brighton and Hove . A place of worship has existed on the hilltop site for about 1,000 years , but the present building has Norman internal features and a 13th-century exterior . Several rounds of restoration in the Victorian era included some structural additions . A wide range of monuments and wall paintings survive inside , including one commemorating Richard Shelley \u2014 owner of nearby Patcham Place and one of the most important noblemen in the early history of Brighton . The church , which is Grade II * listed , continues to serve as the Anglican place of worship for residents of Patcham , which 20th-century residential development has transformed from a vast rural parish into a large outer suburb of Brighton . Patcham 's first church served a large rural area north of the fishing village of Brighthelmston \u2014 the ancient predecessor of Brighton . A nucleated settlement developed around this building , which was reconstructed during the Norman era . A wide-ranging series of alterations were carried out by Victorian church restorers to improve the building 's structural condition and provide more space to cater for the growing population . As Patcham developed into a suburb in the 20th century , more churches opened in the area and were administered from All Saints Church . The building 's plain exterior contrasts with its well-preserved and , in parts , ancient interior whose features include wall paintings and stone memorials . The churchyard has a set of Grade II-listed tombs . = = History = = The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that the area now covered by the county of Sussex was reached by Saxon forces in 477 . Within a few years , they controlled land along the English Channel coast as far as Pevensey . By the 10th century , the Kingdom of the South Saxons was fully established ; its boundaries match those of the present county . The area was divided into smaller administrative areas called hundreds . Patcham and its neighbouring village of Preston were part of Preston Hundred , one of four hundreds covering present-day Brighton and Hove . The lowest administrative level was the parish , based around a church . The parish of Patcham was recorded ( under the name Piceham ) at the time of the Domesday survey in 1086 , by which time a church existed at the centre of a small village on a spur of land near the top of the South Downs . The parish , which covered 4,325 acres ( 1,750 ha ) , was unusually large , and its 11th-century population of about 1,750 was one of the largest for any Sussex parish . William de Warenne , 1st Earl of Surrey , who held most of the land in the local hundreds , owned the manor . The area around the church gradually became the centre of population within the parish , and a village developed on the hillside leading up to the church , east of the modern London Road . The Saxon church was rebuilt in the 12th and 13th centuries , and the only feature which may survive from that era is a blocked doorway . It was reset in the north aisle when that was built in 1898 . The doorway has been described as \" Norman or possibly earlier \" , \" pre- [ Norman ] Conquest \" and \" could be Saxon \" by various sources . The Victoria County History of Sussex goes further by stating it was originally in the north wall of the nave , but identifies it as 12th-century . The chancel arch , a \" plain \" structure , was inserted between the chancel and the nave in the 12th century , and the nave is of the same period . The 12th-century chancel was added to in the following 200 years ; its Decorated Gothic windows are 14th-century . Similar windows were inserted in the nave at the same time . In the 13th century , a narrow tower was built at the west end , with thin lancet windows characteristic of the era . Its broach spire dates from the mid-19th century . The tower was given substantial diagonal buttresses with sandstone quoins . Also at this time , the exterior underwent complete restoration with some rebuilding work . The only other changes made before the 19th century was the addition of a porch at the south end and some buttresses on the south wall of the nave , both in the 16th or 17th century . Having stood for more than 600 years with little alteration , the church was completely changed by four reconstructions and restorations in a 74-year period in the 19th century . The last of these , in 1898 , was the most substantial : it added a north aisle , much larger and taller than the rest of the building , and a vestry . In the early 19th century , the building had been in better structural condition than many in Sussex \u2014 a survey in 1825 by Sir Stephen Glynn of the Ecclesiological Society noted that it was \" decently fitted up \" \u2014 but rebuilding ancient churches was fashionable in the Victorian era , and the condition of a surviving medieval corbel suggests that the exterior walls were in poor condition . The three earlier periods of restoration were 1824 \u2013 25 , 1856 and 1880 \u2013 83 . During the third of these , a 13th-century wall painting of Christ in Judgement was discovered above the chancel arch , hidden under 30 layers of whitewash and the remains of two later paintings ; it may be one of the oldest such murals in England , but it was repainted after its rediscovery . In 1898 , at the same time as the north-side extension , the outside walls of the west , east and south sides were coated with grey cement , probably to improve their structural condition ; although this has been described as \" unsightly \" and \" kill [ ing ] the exterior stone dead \" , one historian has argued that because many medieval churches were rendered in this way , rather than having uncovered flint walls , it gives the impression of what a typical church of that era may look like . Patcham 's proximity to the ever-growing resort of Brighton \u2014 it is 2 miles ( 3.2 km ) north of the Palace Pier on the English Channel coast \u2014 encouraged suburban growth from the mid-19th century . From a low point of 286 in 1801 , the population of the village steadily rose and had nearly quadrupled by the time of the United Kingdom Census 1901 . Brighton Corporation ( the forerunners of the present city council ) built an estate of council housing in Moulsecoomb ( then still part of Patcham parish ) in the early 1920s , and on 1 April 1928 all but 152 acres ( 62 ha ) of the 4,325-acre ( 1,750 ha ) parish were annexed by Brighton to become part of the urban area , known at the time as Greater Brighton . Four large housing estates were built , and the population reached 5,241 in 1930 and continued to rise thereafter . The opening of the north aisle improved capacity at a time when new houses were already surrounding the ancient village centre ; but as development spread to more distant parts of the parish , two more churches were opened \u2014 both initially as chapels of ease to All Saints Church : a temporary building erected on the Braybon Avenue estate in south Patcham became the Church of Christ the King , which was replaced by a permanent brick-built church in 1958 ; and in the same year , architect John Wells-Thorpe designed and built the Church of the Ascension in Westdene , a newly developed suburb west of the London Road . The original temporary church at Braybon Avenue became a church hall for Christ the King 's congregation , and All Saints Church gained its own hall in 1937 when Mackie Hall was built on Mackie Avenue . It was closed in 1995 . Another round of restoration took place in 1989 . The interior was redesigned , and a reredos was made out of old choir stalls which had been removed . = = Memorials = = The church contains several memorials , of which the oldest is a wall tablet commemorating Richard Shelley , one of the earliest owners of Patcham Place , who died in 1594 . Patcham Place has its origins in a 16th-century manor house in an isolated position west of the London Road . Its first owner , William West , 1st Baron De La Warr , passed it to Richard Shelley \u2014 son of Sir John Shelley of Michelgrove and a member of the family which later became the first Shelley Baronetcy . Shelley lived in Patcham from 1546 , and was an important figure in Brighton 's early history : in 1579 , he and three other local noblemen were appointed by the Privy Council to form a commission to record and regulate the \" ancient customs \" of the villagers and to mediate between the fishermen and the farmers , who often had conflicting needs . The commissioners produced a book , The Book of All The Auncient [ Ancient ] Customs heretofore used amonge the fishermen of the Toune of Brighthelmston , whose orders were enshrined in law . The memorial , of which only parts remain intact , is flanked by pilasters , the Shelley coat of arms and a naked grave-digger on each side . Elsewhere in the church , three generations of the Paine family are commemorated by tablets in the chancel ; John Paine of the second generation rebuilt Patcham Place in 1764 . He was the uncle by marriage of Thomas Read Kemp , who developed Brighton 's high-class Kemp Town estate in the 19th century . The Roe family and its descendants of Withdean are also represented . William Roe and his son William Thomas Roe were closely involved with the former Board of Customs ( now Her Majesty 's Customs and Excise ) ; William Roe was its chairman for 14 years . William Thomas Roe also served on The Board of Admiralty . His son , his daughter 's husband and their son also have their own memorials . The manor of Withdean Cayliffe , one of the manors within the parish of Patcham , passed through the family after William Roe acquired it in 1794 . Outside , there are seven nearly identical chest-tombs , all of which are several centuries old and appear to belong to members of the Scrase family . Together with two unrelated tombs nearby , which are 18th- or early 19th-century , they were listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 26 August 1999 . On the north side of the churchyard , which is traditionally used for burials of criminals and those who committed suicide , a memorial survives to \" a smuggler , unfortunately shot \" . = = Architecture and fittings = = The plan of All Saints Church comprises a west tower with heavy buttresses and a broach spire , a three-bay nave with a tall aisle on the north side ( described by one historian as \" quite out of proportion to the rest of the building , particularly in height \" ) , and a porch on the south wall , a chancel and a vestry . Although the north aisle of 1898 was flint-built with courses of red brick , the rest of the church 's exterior was clad in cement at the same time . Before this , the outside walls had been entirely flint with stone dressings and sandstone quoins . Both sides of the nave are buttressed , as is the southwest corner of the tower . These buttresses may have been added in the 16th century . The roof of the tower , below the squat 19th-century spire , is of slate ; the rest of the church has a tiled roof . The porch has a gabled roof above a 14th-century archway . The tower contains three bells . One is dated 1639 , and another is known to have been repaired in 1724 . The chancel roof is panelled , while the nave roof has vertical queen-post supports with ancient tie-beams . The nave and chancel are separated by an ancient chancel arch which has recesses for a reredos on each side . These may be contemporary with the 12th-century structure . Above the chancel arch are the remains of a 13th-century wall painting showing Christ in Judgement . It has been dated to c . 1230 , and depicts the ascension to Heaven of the dead and the weighing of their souls by Jesus Christ , who is flanked by the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist . The fresco was in fragmentary condition when it was discovered in the 1880s , and has been redrawn . Other paintings may have existed elsewhere on the walls , but none are visible now . There are lancet windows in the north and south walls and on the tower , some with stone tracery ( including the east window in the main body of the church ) . The chancel and nave windows are 14th-century and in the Decorated Gothic style common at the time , while the tower windows and bell-openings are smaller and in the Early English style popular in the 13th century , when the tower was built . The largest window , which sits under a hoodmould , is in the east end of the chancel ; it is a three-light lancet with prominent tracery in the curvilinear / reticulated style . The window dates from the 14th century , which may make it the same age as a small window next to the porch , which has twin lights with foliated heads set below a quatrefoil in an ogive arch . Both windows also have scrollwork drip-moulds . Most other windows are plain trefoil-headed single lancets . The blocked doorway in the modern north aisle is the oldest surviving part of the church . Its lintel is 10 inches ( 25 cm ) thick and sits below 11 voussoirs , each about 8 inches ( 20 cm ) across . Below the lintel , the former opening is 6.8 feet ( 2.1 m ) high and 2.75 feet ( 0.84 m ) wide ; gradual settling into the ground has masked its original 7.5-foot ( 2.3 m ) height . The jambs are made up of five stones of equal height , but the uppermost is wider because it served as an impost . Inside the church , the jambs and arch are visible , but there is no lintel . The wall of the chancel retains a trefoil-arched piscina added during the 14th-century restoration work . The font \u2014 a \" rather florid circular \" example \u2014 dates from 1864 , and the church possesses Eucharistic objects dating from the 16th and 17th centuries , such as a chalice of 1568 and a paten dating from 1666 . The west wall has a wide range of old carved prayer and commandment boards , which are a common feature of Sussex churches . Ancient examples of graffiti , consisting of etched crosses and dates , also survives inside ; such \" curious carvings \" are also common in Sussex . = = Current status = = All Saints Church was listed at Grade II * on 13 October 1952 . Worship at All Saints is in the Open Evangelical style . There is a Sunday school and regular youth group . All Saints is the church in the Benefice of Patcham All Saints , which also incorporates the Church of the Ascension in Westdene , a postwar suburb west of Patcham . This is a modern building of brick and glass , designed in 1958 by architect John Wells-Thorpe . The ecclesiastical parish of All Saints covers the north of Brighton and its rural hinterland , incorporating Withdean , Westdene , Patcham , Hollingbury , part of Preston ( as far south as Preston Park railway station ) , and the scattered residential buildings north of the A27 Brighton Bypass and south of Pyecombe . Following a review by the Diocese of Chichester in 2005 , parts of the west side of the parish were transferred to the Church of the Good Shepherd on Dyke Road in Brighton , and at the south end another section was ceded to St John the Evangelist 's Church in Preston Village . At the same time the decision was taken to close the Church of Christ the King ( which had been the parish church of South Patcham ) and divide its parish between All Saints and St John the Evangelist 's churches . All Saints Church therefore received the congregation from the northern part of the Church of Christ the King 's parish . The diocese declared the Church of Christ the King redundant from 1 December 2006 , but from 20 July 2007 it was in use again as a place of worship . In that year , two displaced congregations whose churches had been demolished joined to form a new church community , which bought the building and renamed it the Fountain Centre . The Elim Balfour Road Church in Preston Village , a Pentecostal church , was demolished in 2007 , and the Immanuel Community Church had been using the former St Augustine 's Church building near Preston Park since the destruction by fire of their church in Hanover in 2003 .",

                    "text": "Alchi Monastery = Alchi Monastery or Alchi Gompa is a Buddhist monastery , known more as a monastic complex ( chos- ' khor ) of temples in Alchi village in the Leh District , of the Indian state under the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council of Jammu and Kashmir . The complex comprises four separate settlements in the Alchi village in the lower Ladakh region with monuments dated to different periods . Of these four hamlets , Alchi monastery is said to be the oldest and most famous . It is administered by the Likir Monastery . Alchi is also part of the three villages ( all in lower Ladakh region ) which constitute the \u2018 Alchi group of monuments \u2019 ; the other two villages adjoining Alchi are the Mangyu and Sumda Chun . The monuments in these three villages are stated to be of \u201c unique style and workmanship \u2019 , but the Alchi monastic complex is the best known . The monastery complex was built , according to local tradition , by the great translator Guru Rinchen Zangpo between 958 and 1055 . However , inscriptions in the preserved monuments ascribe it to a Tibetan noble called Kal-dan Shes-rab later in the 11th century . Dukhang or Assembly Hall and the Main Temple ( gTsug-lag-khang ) , which is a three-storied temple called the Sumtseg ( gSum-brtsegs ) , are built in Kashmiri style as seen in many monasteries ; the third temple is called the Manjushri Temple ( ' Jam-dpal lHa-khang ) . Chortens are also an important part of the complex . The artistic and spiritual details of both Buddhism and the Hindu kings of that time in Kashmir are reflected in the wall paintings in the monastery . These are some of the oldest surviving paintings in Ladakh . The complex also has huge statues of the Buddha and elaborate wood carvings and art-work comparable to the baroque style . Shakti Maira has vividly explained the beauty of this small monastery . = = History = = The history of the monuments in the Alchi complex and in the other two villages in the Alchi group is not precise , in spite of many inscriptions and texts displayed on the walls . Traditionally , the creation of the Alchi complex is attributed to the famous scholar-translator Rinchen Zangpo ( 958 \u2013 1055 ) in the 10th century , along with the Lamayuru Monastery , the Wanla , the Mang-gyu and the Sumda . During the tenth century , the Tibetan King Yeshe Od of Guge , in order to spread Buddhism in the Trans Himalayan region , took the initiative by allocating 21 scholars to the region . However , due to harsh climatic and topographic conditions , only two survived , one of them the esteemed scholar and translator Rinchen Zangpo who established Buddhist activity in the Ladakh region and other areas of India including Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim . During his sojourn there , he also went to the neighbouring countries of Nepal , Bhutan and Tibet . Zangpo became known by the epithet \u201c Lohtsawa \u201d or the \u201c Great Translator \u201d ; he is credited with building 108 monasteries in the trans-Himalayan region in his quest to disseminate Buddhism . He institutionalized Buddhism in the region ; these monasteries are considered the mainstay of Vajrayana of Tibetan Buddhism ( also known as Lamaism ) . Zangpo engaged Kashmiri artists to create wall paintings and sculptures in the legendary 108 monasteries ; only a few of these have survived , with the Alchi Monastery complex in Ladakh having pride of place among all monasteries that he built . Since the monasteries of this period did not belong to any of the established Tibetan schools , they were initially brought under the control of the Kadampa order . When the condition of the monasteries deteriorated , they were mostly taken over by the Gelukpa order , with the exception of Lamayuru which was placed under the Drigunkpa sect . After worship at Alchi monastery ceased for some reason in the fifteenth century , it also became under the Gelugpa sect controlled from Likir . = = Geography and visitor information = = Alchi is located on the south bank of the Indus River at an altitude of 3,100 metres ( 10,200 ft ) and 65 kilometres ( 40 mi ) outside of Leh ( to its west ) . Leh is connected by air from Delhi . The road approach to Leh starts at Manali , a route that is accessible from May or June to October , depending on the snow fall conditions in the valley . The village is in the high altitude rain shadow area of Ladakh . It is laid out in four settlements on the banks of a tributary of the Indus River . The monastic complex is separate from the other village settlements . = = Structures = = The monastery complex has three major shrines : the Dukhang ( Assembly hall ) , the Sumtseg and the Temple of Manjushri , all dating from between the early 12th and early 13th centuries . Chortens are also an important part of the complex . In addition , the Alchi complex has two other important temples , the Translator 's temple called the ' Lotsabha Lakhang ' and a new temple called the ' Lakhang Soma ' . This collection of four small shrines in the Alchi village has been described by The Hindu : ... as a jewel of colours and forms that is so utterly beautiful that the normal state of breathlessness in this high altitude becomes a deep gasp . The artistic and spiritual details of both Buddhism and the Hindu kings of that time in Kashmir are reflected in the wall paintings in the monastery complex . These are some of the oldest surviving paintings in Ladakh . The complex also has huge statues of the Buddha and \" lavish wood carvings and art-work \u2014 almost baroque in style . \" Shakti Maira vividly explains the beauty of this small monastery as \" stylistically rendered in an eclectic mix of Tibetan and Kashmiri faces and clothes . \" = = = Dukhang = = = Dukhang or the Assembly Hall is at the heart of the monastery complex , where monks perform worship and ceremonies . It is large and ancient , and the original wooden door frame is retained . Many additions were made to the ancient structure during the 12th and 13th centuries . The colonnaded veranda leads to the hall from a front courtyard and frescoes of one thousand Buddhas are depicted in the passageway . The Wheel of Life and Mahakal can be seen at the outer gate . The walls of the Dukhang , dedicated to Panch Tath\u0101gatas , are painted with six different mandalas that surround the Vairochana , the main deity worshipped in the hall . The mandalas are set among by many paintings of Buddhas , Bodhisattvas , goddesses , fierce divinities and guardians of dharma , and also lesser divinities . = = = Sumtseg = = = The Alchi Sumtseg in the Alchi complex is one of the most outstanding , but its purpose is not clearly established . The Sumtseg ( gSum-brtsegs ) means a three storied building , though small , was built with loam and natural stone ( reflected in the bland exterior ) in the Tibetan building tradition . However , the luxuriant woodwork columns , facades , walls , clay images and paintings in the interior of the monastery were made by Kashmiri artists . The sanctum in the ground floor and the first floor measures 5.4 metres ( 18 ft ) x5.8 metres ( 19 ft ) with the niches of 2.1 \u2013 2.7 metres ( 6.9 \u2013 8.9 ft ) width and 4 metres ( 13 ft ) height ( niches in the main wall are larger in size vis-a-vis the side walls ) . The niches depict the main images of three Bodhisattvas ( all in standing posture and about 4 metres ( 13 ft ) in height ) and its associate secondary deities ( four in each niche ) with two flying goddesses in each niche . Except for the main wooden door on the top floor , which is dilapidated , the rest of the Sumtseg is well preserved in its original form , as built in the early 13th century . The second floor of the building is more in the form of a balcony with a lantern mounting . Image of Maitreya , the largest in size ( 4.63 metres ( 15.2 ft ) ) , is deified on the back wall and flanked by the images of Avalokiteshwara to its right and Manjushri to its left . An interesting aspect of the elegant drapery ( dhotis ) worn by the deities is the display of different themes printed in different textile patterns ; Maitreya 's dhoti depicts the life of Buddha , the Avlokiteshwara 's dhoti shows holy places and royal palaces and Manjushri 's dhoti has adepts ( of 84 Mahasiddhas ) printed on it . Iconographically , the deities have a single head with four arms but differently portrayed . Each deity is identified to a different Buddha . Maitreya has a five Buddha crown representing Vairochana . Avalokiteshwara 's crown represents Amitabha and Manjushri 's crown represents Akshobhya . An inscription in the main niche states that the three images are reliquaries representing body , speech and mind-compared to the three bodies of the Buddha-namely , Maitreya denoting the Buddha body of reality , Avolokiteshwara representing pure rapture and Manjushri representing emanational body . In simple terms , they represent the Buddhist concepts of Compassion , Hope and Wisdom . Further , depiction of Buddha \u2019 s life in textile prints on the dhoti is a unique representation of the cycle of the life of Buddha that is arranged in a reverse sequence . It is in medallion form painted red , with each medallion measuring 15 centimetres ( 5.9 in ) over a blue background . 48 scenes representing 41 episodes with five preaching scenes and two scenes of punarnirvana \u2013 all are arranged in pre-determined sequence representing the events in Buddha 's life between the last journey in Tushita heaven and the first sermon in Sarnath . Dating of the Sumtseg has been made on the basis of the names of the priests inscribed on the top floor of the structure . The last name inscribed is that of the Drigungpa school of Drigungpa or Jigten Gonpo ( 1143 \u2013 1217 ) from which it is inferred that Sumsteg was established in the early 13th century . = = = Manjushri Temple = = = From various analysis of the iconography of the temple compared with that of the Sumtseg and Sumda Assembly hall , it has been inferred that the temple dates to around 1225 AD . Manjushri Temple , also called ' Jampe Lhakhang ' , is built around the four central images of Manjushri ( seated back to back ) seen on a common platform that is 5.7 metres ( 19 ft ) square . Four pillars form the enclosure for the images ; the pillars are supported with cross bracing connected to the painted wood ceiling . The paintings on the wooden ceiling are similar to those in the Sumtseg and the two chortens , but are unrefined . Located close to the Indus river , the temple is not well preserved except for wood carvings on the doors and pillars . The Lhotsava or Lotsawa temple to its left side is a later addition . The Manjushri images are on a common pedestal ( 85 centimetres ( 33 in ) high ) , painted recently to give an overall picture of fright since the decorative scrolls are derived from the tails of Makara surrounded by images of animals , gods and symbols . The normal colour attributed to Manjushri images is orange , but in this temple they are depicted with different colours . Each of the four images is single-headed with four arms that are adorned with a sword , a book on top of a lotus , a bow and an arrow . Each wall in the shrine is dedicated to a Buddha image . Manjushri is depicted on the main wall , seated on a lion throne ; the side walls have images of Amitabha on the right and Aksharabhya on the left . The images are set around the central image of Manjushri in a niche in the wall . Manjushri is adorned with jewellery ( pearls and other moulded forms ) and a crown made of a flower band . In the base of the throne on which the Manjushri image is deified , is a depiction of ' Seven Jewels ' and ' Eight Suspicious Symbols ' ( flanked by lions ) enclosed in a square frame that is distinctive . The top of the throne frame has makara mountings . = = = Chortens = = = The earliest recorded Chortens are the Great Chorten and the Small Chorten ( stupa ) to the early 13th century , following the building of the Sumtseg . These chortens are decorated gateways known locally as ' Kakani Ch\u00f6rten ' and ' Ka-ka-ni mchod-rten ' that are considered unique to Alchi with historical link to other monuments . More chortens were added between the 13th and 14th centuries . In the Alchi complex , there are also three other chortens , which have ancient paintings .",

It lies to the north of the village of Kewstoke , and the stretch of coastline called Sand Bay north of the town of Weston-super-Mare . On a clear day it commands views over Flat Holm , of the Bristol Channel , South Wales , Clevedon , the Second Severn Crossing and the Severn Bridge . A line drawn between Sand Point and Lavernock Point in South Wales marks the lower limit of the Severn Estuary and the start of the Bristol Channel . Middle Hope is a sequence of carboniferous limestone with unusual geological features including a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and as a result has been designated as a regionally important geological site . The underlying geology and soil types support scarce plants such as the smallflower buttercup , honewort , Cheddar pink and Somerset hair grass . Human use of the sites is shown by a bowl barrow and disc barrow from late Neolithic or Bronze Age and the site of a likely motte-and-bailey castle . Woodspring Priory , a former Augustinian priory which was founded in the early 13th century , sits just inland of the rocky promontory . The priory and surrounding land is owned by the National Trust and is a popular place for walking . = = Geology = = At Middle Hope a sequence of carboniferous limestone is exposed , which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas , demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections . The site contains a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and shore platform . These features have led to the designation of Middle Hope as a regionally important geological site ( RIGS ) . The raised beach of wave-cut platforms has been created by changes in sea level of the Bristol Channel since the Quaternary period . The arrangement of volcanic and sedimentary rocks , including the Black Rock Limestone , illustrates the events of 350 million years ago . The strata have been tilted and compressed during the variscan orogeny . = = Flora = = Among scarce plants found on Sand Point are smallflower buttercup , and honewort . The range of soils at the site support various flora and fauna . The calcareous grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata , while the scrub towards the west of the site is dominated by hawthorn ( Crataegus monogyna ) and blackthorn ( Prunus spinosa ) , while that to the east consists of common gorse ( Ulex europaeus ) and bramble ( Rubus fruticosus agg ) . Less common plants include the cheddar pink ( Dianthus gratianopolitanus ) and Somerset hair grass ( Koeleria vallesiana ) . = = History = = Evidence of early human occupation if provided by a bowl barrow and disc barrow from the late Neolithic or Bronze Age have been identified on the higher ground . The bowl barrow is 10 metres ( 33 ft ) in diameter and approximately 0.5 metres ( 1 ft 8 in ) high . Slightly west of the bowl barrow is a disc barrow surrounded by a bank and ditch which enclose an area about 8 metres ( 26 ft ) across . These are situated at the highest point where the Ordnance Survey have constructed a triangulation station . A motte-and-bailey castle may have been constructed after the Norman Conquest . The site is known as Castle Mound or Castle Batch and can be seen as a 2 metres ( 6 ft 7 in ) high mound which is approximately 30 metres ( 98 ft ) in diameter and marked by a ditch on the landward eastern edge . The mound was damaged by the construction of a building during World War II . The medieval date for the construction is in doubt with some sources suggesting that the mound may have been a watchtower constructed in the 16th century . The walls of the sheep fold were built by prisoners from the Napoleonic Wars . Hope Cove on the northern coast had a reputation for smuggling as it was \" well away from the men of HM Customs and Excise \" . Woodspring Priory was an Augustinian priory . It was founded by William de Courtney , in the early 13th century , and dedicated to Thomas Becket . The small community built a church and monastic lodgings during the next hundred years . They were Victorine Canons who were influenced by the Cistercians emphasis on manual labour and self-sufficiency . As a result , the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm , as well as providing clergy for surrounding churches . Despite endowments of land the priory was not wealthy until the 15th century when further building work , including the current priory church , infirmary and barn was undertaken . It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers . In 1969 the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work , and since the 1990s have rented out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation . The surviving buildings include the priory church , which was a 15th-century replacement for the earlier 13th century structure , infirmary , barn and 16th century prior 's lodging which was converted into a farmhouse . The whole site was arranged around a central cloister from which only the east wall and west wall of the chapter house remain , the sacristy , refectory , chapter house , lady chapel and parlour having been demolished . Because of the biological and geological interest the site was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest in 1952 . In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune . During World War II weapons were tested at Sand Point , in association with the base at Birnbeck Pier which was commissioned as \" HMS Birnbeck \" by the Admiralty as part of the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development ( DMWD ) for research into new weapons . To support this buildings were constructed at St Thomas Head , east of Middle Hope . Some of these have since been removed and the site is now used by QinetiQ as an explosives and shock test facility .",

It depicts the installation of the Sigismund Bell in the Wawel Cathedral in Krak\u00f3w in 1521 . The bell was installed in the Sigismund Tower and rung for the first time on 13 July 1521 . The bell is considered to be one of the national symbols of Poland . This painting is one of a number of historical paintings by Matejko . It shows a crowd of people , with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance . It conveys the Golden Era of the Polish Renaissance , and the power of the Kingdom of Poland . There are several alternative names for the painting . They include The consecrating of the Sigismund bell ... ( Po\u015bwi\u0119cenie dzwonu Zygmunta ... ) , as proposed by Mieczys\u0142aw Treter , The raising of the Sigismund bell ... , King Sigismund 's Bell , or just Sigismund Bell ( Dzwon Zygmunta ) . = = History = = The Sigismund Bell painting was created in 1874 . During his work , Matejko commissioned craftsmen to create a replica of a scaffolding that was used to move the bell , and he identified its likely original location , in order for it to be portrayed realistically . There are numerous anecdotes associated with this painting . Matejko used his family for models , and likely the painting contains nearly all the members of his family . The painting was well received by contemporaries , and Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski published an extensive and positive review in 1875 in Przegl\u0105d Polski . The work was displayed in Paris in 1875 , and probably contributed to Matejko 's recognition by the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise ; three years later it was displayed there again , during the Exposition Universelle ( 1878 ) , and ( together with two other paintings \u2013 the Unia lubelska ( Union of Lublin ) and Wac\u0142aw Wilczek ) yielded him an honorary golden medal . The painting is in the collection of the National Museum , Warsaw . = = Composition and significance = = Matejko was deeply interested in the era of the Renaissance in Poland , and this painting is one of a number of historical paintings that he set in that period . The composition is very colorful , yet realistic . It conveys the Golden Era of Polish Renaissance , and the power of the contemporary Kingdom of Poland , both its elites and the common people . The left side of the painting is focused on the richness and glory of the era , while the right notes the hard work of ordinary people that made this greatness possible . Although the painting is usually known as the The hanging of the Sigismund bell .. , in fact it shows not the moment of hanging but the moment of the bell 's emergence from the mold in which it was cast . The painting shows a crowd , with a number of identifiable figures of historical importance . On the left , there is the royal court , but only the king , Sigismund I , his family ( including queen Bona Sforza ) , and the court jester , Sta\u0144czyk , can be identified . Sigismund , the patron of the Sigismund Bell , and his son Sigismund August , were Polish kings that inspired other works of Matejko , including The Babin Republic ( 1881 ) and The Founding of the Lubranski Academy in Pozna\u0144 ( 1886 ) . Sigismund I 's portrayal on the Hanging ... painting is the one where Matejko shows him with pride and respect . Other figures in the court include banker Jan Boner , merchant and official Seweryn Bethman , and castellan and voivode Stanis\u0142aw Kmita . Bishop Jan Choje\u0144ski is also shown on the painting , consecrating the bell , with canon Grzegorz Lubra\u0144ski nearby . Outside the court , master bell-founder Hans Beham is seen above the bell . Between him and the court there are two dark-clad figures . These are the Wawel architect Bartolommeo Berrecci , and a musician , Valentin Bakfark , who according to a legend threw a string from his instrument into the melted bronze ( in fact , he arrived in Poland two decades after the bell was cast ) . In the background , Wawel Castle can be seen . As he would often do , Matejko included people whom he considered significant for the era , but who could not be present in the scene , like Sigismund I 's son , Sigismund II August , who would have been only one year old . In 1885 Matejko would paint a sequel-like picture , Zygmunt I s\u0142uchaj\u0105cy Dzwonu Zygmunta ( Sigismund I listening to the Sigismund Bell ) , showing an older Sigismund and Sta\u0144czyk , contemplating the passing of their era .",

In antiquity , the area was named Pharsalos , and became known for the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BCE , where Julius Caesar defeated Pompey during the Great Roman Civil War . Heuzey and the architect Henri Daumet were involved in an official mission to collect objects related to Caesar 's campaigns ; they also were interested in other artifacts unrelated to their work . In 1863 , they found this marble bas-relief embedded in the walls of a church in the neighborhood of Paleo-Loutro in Farsala and named it The Exaltation of the Flower . Heuzey was informed that the stone was originally discovered in a garden , close to another stone that was not recovered . Heuzey purchased the stone and had it sent to the Louvre in Paris . Back in France , Heuzy would become curator of the Louvre , where he would retire in 1908 . = = Description = = A precise description and interpretation of the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century . Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others . British Greek art scholar Martin Robertson notes that both women can be seen wearing the tubular peplos garment common to the Classical period . According to the descriptive text found in the Atlas database of the exhibited works of art at the Louvre , the women also are wearing a kekryphalos , a hairnet in the Greco-Roman hairstyle , and appear to hold a type of flower , perhaps poppy or pomegranate . One of the women in the stele carries what resembles a bag , presumed to be carrying seeds in the interpretation . = = Analysis = = In his 1868 paper , Heuzey argued that the images in the stele suggested the goddesses Persephone ( Kore ) and Demeter , referring to the cult of Kore and the legend of Demeter found in the Homeric Hymns . French archaeologist and art historian Maxime Collignon explained , \" Heuzey believes that this monument refers to the cultus of Core , daughter of Demeter , a divinity suggesting in Greek legend the ephemeral but incessantly recurring bloom of nature . \" French archaeologist Olivier Rayet ( 1847 \u2013 1887 ) disagreed with the interpretation Heuzy offered . While Heuzey 's perspective still has adherents , it has largely fallen out of favor among art historians . According to the Perseus Project at Tufts University , \" It is now generally agreed ... that the figures represented are mortals rather than goddesses . \" German archaeologist Heinrich Brunn believed the decorative qualities of the Pharsalos stele originated in Asia Minor . Following this line of reasoning , Scottish archaeologist Alexander Stuart Murray compared the facial features of the stele , such as the eyes , lips , and nose , to similar facial features found in the Harpy Tomb relief from Xanthos in Lycia . American curator Edward Robinson notes the influence of the Ionic schools on this and other artwork from ancient Aeolia , now known as Thessaly : \" It is now a question whether these works were done by local artists under this influence , or by Ionic artists who may have established themselves in Thessaly , as they did in other parts of Greece . \" The Ionian style 's influence also may be seen in the depiction of the hair-net worn by the women in the relief . French scholar Charles Picard ( 1883 \u2013 1965 ) argued that if the stele fragments were reconstructed , the bottom missing fragment would have showed the figure on the left standing and the one on the right seated : Neither can the oblique trend of the drapery , belt-high in the silhouette ( in profile ) of the elder , be explained \u2026 without accepting that she was seated , her left forearm resting on her thigh . Only thus could the dice be handled . Only thus , moreover , can so extreme a slope in the pleats coming away from the shoulder , pleats that would have to fall vertically in a non-seated figure , become understandable . On the right , let it not be readily forgotten that all the pleats turn strongly forward , so that they pass the centerline of the stele , marked by the high , triumphant flower and the mingled group of hands . For the maiden on the left , although the cascade of pleats is generally much more direct \u2014 as appropriate to a standing posture \u2014 some of them , curiously arched , turn forward as well , for example at the left armhole . They can scarcely be understood without again invoking the supporting effect produced by the leg of the seated woman . The folds of Kore \u2019 s sleeve , which in 1939 I drew a little too short in the descent , carry on to Demeter \u2019 s lap , where they spread out . German classical archaeologist Roland Hampe ( 1908 \u2013 1981 ) disagreed with Picard 's hypothesis , saying that the size of the stele should demonstrate that both women were standing , not sitting . = = Flowers , fungi , or bones = = It is generally agreed that the plants depicted in the stele fragment are either poppies or pomegranate flowers , however , classical archaeologists and historians of ancient Greek art discuss different species in the literature : German scholar Ernst Langlotz ( 1895 \u2013 1978 ) thought that the women were holding a type of rose ; Picard recognizes the symbolism of Demeter and Kore and identifies the flowers as a species of poppy , possibly the opium poppy , the Oriental poppy , or the Iranian poppy . Careful examination of the thick ' stems ' fails to resemble that of the flowers . German scholar Eugen Petersen ( 1837 \u2013 1919 ) proposed that the figures were holding knucklebones ( talus bones from goats or sheep used to play the game of jacks ) in their left hand and roses in the right hand ; Hampe argues that the stele depicts only knucklebones , not flowers . In 1911 , Greek scholar and archaeologist Rufus B. Richardson , formerly of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens , observed that what was being described as flowers in the relief , looked similar to mushrooms . English classicist Robert Graves and Italian ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini both have referred to the fragment as evidence for the entheogen hypothesis , speculating that the significant items depicted in the work are a type of psychoactive mushroom that was used in the Eleusinian Mysteries . Graves even featured the image as the cover of one edition of The Greek Myths , noting that although it might be depicted in artwork , it would remain unnamed in texts because of its sacredness . American classicist Carl A. P. Ruck has made similar arguments . Although the entheogen hypothesis is controversial and generally rejected by mainstream scholarship , in a review of Hampe 's Die Stele aus Pharsalos im Louvre ( 1951 ) , Picard notes that \" one may be increasingly reminded that Pharsalos was indeed an Eleusinian center \" . = = Alternate titles = = The work is referred to by many different titles in contemporary literature .

The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match . This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles , and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time . According to the Australian federal government the team \" is one of Australia 's most cherished sporting legends \" . Including five Test matches , Australia played a total of 31 first-class fixtures , plus three other games , two of the non-first-class matches being played in Scotland . They had a busy schedule , with 112 days of play scheduled in 144 days , meaning that they often played every day of the week except Sunday . Their record in the first-class games was 23 won and 8 drawn ; in all matches , they won 25 and drew 9 ; many of the victories were by large margins . They won the Test series 4 \u2013 0 with one draw . The strength of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up , which included Bradman , Arthur Morris , vice-captain Lindsay Hassett , Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes , and the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . Due to the popularity of Bradman , generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time , and the fact that he had announced that it was his farewell international tour , the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country , and many records for match attendances were broken . The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times , in the Second , Third and Fourth Tests , and stands to this day . = = Touring party = = = = Significance = = The 1948 Australian team has great significance in cricket history as it is the only side to tour England unbeaten , earning the sobriquet The Invincibles . The tour was captain Donald Bradman 's last Test series , and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in . It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians . Even so , various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians as one of the best cricket teams ever , and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team , Warwick Armstrong 's Australian side of just after World War I , the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s . This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton , Bradman 's batting rival from the 1930s , who wrote ' the 1948 Australian side to England , side that some critics , ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season , dubbed the \" best Australian team ever \" \u2013 which was just moonshine . Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948 ' , but his view is very much in the minority . The high regard with which The Invincibles are held in the annals of Australian and world cricket is reflected in the various honours accorded to the players . Bradman , Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . Hassett , Morris and Harvey were later inducted , so that 20 % of the inductees are from the 1948 team . Of these six , all except Hassett were selected in Australia 's Team of the Century , with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy . Bradman , Lindwall , Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame . In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians . Graveney strongly disagreed with the result , writing ' there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman 's Australian tourists of 1948 ' . The computer regarded Sam Loxton as a member of the team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey , if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team . = = Preparations = = Since the resumption of cricket following World War II , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and their captain Donald Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . The committee that selected the touring party was Bradman , Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer . They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced the team that day . The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling . This was in large part because England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six-ball overs in the Tests ; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs , which usually takes more than 55 overs to accumulate , the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available . A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling , so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack , in this case Australia . Australia had injury concerns to key players ahead of the tour . Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack , and he only made the trip after a 3 \u2013 2 vote by a medical panel , despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit . Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon . In addition , his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action . The injury was worked on ahead of the tour , while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action . The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled , and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied . Bradman 's counsel was effective , as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour . Bill Jeanes , who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , was offered the job of managing the 1948 team , but turned it down . Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that cricket historian Gideon Haigh has called \" increasingly officious and liverish \" . He was replaced by Keith Johnson , the New South Wales delegate to the Australian Board of Control . Johnson had previously managed the Australian Services team \u2014 which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett \u2014 in the Victory Tests that took place in 1945 at the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe . = = = Warm-up matches in Australia = = = Before they sailed for England , Australia played three warm-up matches . The first two were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart and at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground , Launceston ; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth . In Hobart , Australia scored 538 / 5 declared with centuries by Barnes , Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122 . Using a mixture of pace and spin , they reduced Tasmania to 186 / 7 when time ran out . In Launceston , Australia won by an innings and 49 runs . Toshack took 5 / 24 as Tasmania fell for 123 . Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116 , Barnes taking 3 / 1 . Four days later , on Saturday 13 March , the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia . Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112 , while five bowlers took two wickets each . Australia replied with 442 / 7 declared , including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman . Western Australia only had time to reach 62 / 3 and the game was drawn . The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500 . = = Voyage and stopover in Ceylon = = The team set sail on board RMS Strathaird from Fremantle on Friday 19 March . En route to England , the Australians berthed in Colombo where they played a one-day single-innings match \u2014 not limited overs \u2014 against the Ceylon national team at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . The local newspaper The Islander ran a headline of \" Bradman Will Definitely Play \" and this guaranteed a crowd of more than 20,000 . Australia batted first and became suspicious about the pitch as the morning went on . At lunch , Ian Johnson demanded that the pitch be measured and it was found to be only 20 yards ( 18 m ) long . After that , the bowlers delivered from two yards behind the crease . Australia made 184 / 8 declared ( Barnes 49 , Miller 46 ) before a monsoon ended the match with Ceylon at 46 / 2 in reply . The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to a resounding welcome . Bradman announced the delivery of 17,000 food parcels as a gift to the British people from the State of Victoria . Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post-war austerity . = = Popularity = = Despite Australia 's ruthless on-field dominance and a succession of one-sided victories , the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest . Bradman 's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team 's popularity with the public , especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign . A leading cricket writer of the time , R. C. Robertson-Glasgow , said \" we want him to do well . We feel we have a share in him . He is more than Australian . He is a world batsman . \" The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \" cities , towns and hotels are beflagged , carpets set down , and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome . He is the Prince of Cricketers . \" Writing later , Haigh opined that \" perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer \" . Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day , and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live , causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin . Of Bradman 's retirement , Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack : \" ... a miracle has been removed from among us ... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal . \" As a team , the Australians were greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country , even when wet weather curtailed the matches . The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times , in the Second Test at Lord 's , the Third Test at Old Trafford , and the Fourth Test at Headingley . The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil . Off the field , the Australians were inundated with requests for social functions , including appointments with government officials and members of the royal family , and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements , with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days . Three-day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day , although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days . Team manager Keith Johnson , the only administrator in the touring party , was flooded with phone calls and letters . Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson 's tireless work would cause health problems and that \" it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through \" . Wisden said \" Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager , Mr Keith Johnson , hard-working and always genial ... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players , Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour . \" Bradman said that \" no side could have wished for a better manager \" . = = Bradman 's role = = Bradman 's position as a selector gave him more power than previous Australian captains , who did not have an explicit vote in team selection . This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while still an active player , a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history . According to Haigh , he \" was the dominant figure in Australian cricket \" , and an \" unimpeachable figure \" . At the age of 40 , Bradman was by four years the oldest player on the team ; three quarters of his team were 32 or younger , and some viewed him as a father figure . Bradman wrote that this was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . However , some players expressed displeasure at Bradman 's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition . Miller deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia 's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex . He also deplored Bradman 's hard-nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as \" festival matches \" . Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability , Miller played with reckless aggression , rather than a measured style in line with his captain 's aim of remaining undefeated . Bradman 's letters in later life , published posthumously , revealed his hostility towards Miller . Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence \u2014 one of the reserve batsmen \u2014 to partake in meaningful matchplay due to captain 's reluctance to risk Australia 's unbeaten run . = = Roles and strategy = = As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week \u2014 Sunday was always a rest day \u2014 Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate , except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire , the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson-Gower 's XI , when they chose their strongest team . As a result , no member of the squad \u2014 Bradman included \u2014 played in more than 23 of the first-class matches . Thus , the vice-captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested , and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them . Wisden opined that \" in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders \" . Likewise , the batting was regularly rotated . The three openers Barnes , Morris and Brown took turns sitting out , while the middle-order was changed frequently and the wicket-keeping duties divided between Tallon and Saggers . Australia 's bowling attack was led by Lindwall and Miller , who took the new ball in the Tests . Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something that usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs , and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign . The new ball rule also meant that spin bowling was less effective in the Tests , so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests , off spinner Johnson , until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring . Together they took only eight wickets . Things were different in the county matches . As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests , he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches , and the three spinners Ring , Johnson and McCool did more of the work , especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests . Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests , despite not being in Bradman 's first-choice team . Bradman even used Hamence , a reserve batsman , to open the bowling at times , in order to rest his bowlers , and in the second match against Yorkshire , decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win , so that his bowlers could recuperate . = = Ashes Test matches = = The five-Test Ashes series was won convincingly by Australia 4 \u2013 0 . England was captained by Norman Yardley and their batting was strong on paper , the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton , Cyril Washbrook , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . They were supported by the likes of Joe Hardstaff junior , Tom Dollery , Charlie Barnett , Jack Crapp , John Dewes , Allan Watkins , Yardley and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans . However , they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall , Miller and Johnston \u2014 supported by the medium pace of Toshack \u2014 a real handful , especially with the 55-over new ball rule . Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers , with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen . Prior to World War II , pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body . England were yet to develop similar bowlers , and as a result , Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation . At one stage , the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton , something that provoked great controversy . Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece , at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively , while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15 . For England , the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton , who scored 562 runs at 62.44 . Washbrook ( 356 runs at 50.85 ) was the only other player to average beyond 45 . In contrast , Australia 's batsmen had relatively little difficulty against the hosts ' attack . England 's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line-up he managed only 18 wickets at 38.22 . Alec Coxon , Dick Pollard , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support . Jim Laker , Jack Young , Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action . Bedser was the only English bowler to take more than nine wickets . Morris led the runscoring and century-making with 696 runs at 87.00 and three triple-figure scores , supported by Bradman ( 508 at 72.57 ) and Barnes ( 329 at 82.25 ) . With the first three batsmen in such form , Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings , averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets . The resounding Australian victories gave the England selectors many problems as they sought to find a combination that could challenge the tourists ' superiority . As a result , England used 21 players in all , while Australia only used 15 , one of which was forced by injury . Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests , while England only had seven such players . = = = First Test = = = Since the Second World War , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first-class matches , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . It was thought that Bradman would play Ring , but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The first innings set the pattern of the series as the England top-order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather , but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton . During the interval , heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption . Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall . At 15 / 2 , Compton came in , and together with Edrich , they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring , leaving England at 46 / 4 . Two runs later , Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board . Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74 , England only had two wickets left . Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Both fell within two runs , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top-scored with 63 . Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch . Australia 's openers Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes . Ideal batting conditions greeted the players on the second day . Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris . Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62 . Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker . Australia scored slowly , as Yardley employed leg theory to slow the scoring . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24 . Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 . Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes , with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes . It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs . On the third morning , Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg . Johnson and Tallon came and went , failing to pass 21 . The scoring was slow during this passage of play \u2014 Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs . Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting . Both fell in quick succession , but Australia 's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners , with Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44.2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook and Edrich fell early , leaving England at 39 / 2 . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton , who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day . Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The English had the better of the late afternoon period , scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes . Hutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated and a thunderstorm stopped proceedings . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending a 111-run partnership at 150 / 3 . The innings was then repeatedly interrupted by poor light . Wisden opined that \" rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day \" . Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack , and Barnett followed soon after at 264 / 5 . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge , aided by a 57-run partnership with his captain before Johnston dismissed Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead , with Compton on 154 . Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , which was briefly interrupted twice by rain . After the resumption , Compton was out hit wicket for 184 after attempting to hook Miller . He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden opined that \" No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances \" . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour . England finished at 441 , leaving Australia a target of 98 . Lindwall 's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each \u2014 Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg . This left Australia 48 / 2 . Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries . = = = Second Test = = = Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge . On the other hand , England made three changes ; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young , all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5.batsman . Following his injury in the previous Test , Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman , who gambled on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat . Miller played , but was unfit to bowl . Barnes fell for a duck , and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings , slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser . In the meantime , Morris , after a slow start , made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket , including 14 fours and one six . His innings was noted for powerful , well-placed cover drives . His dismissal left Australia at 166 / 3 , quickly followed by Miller , left Australia at 173 / 4 . Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly , taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225 / 6 . Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258 / 7 . Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Tallon batted on , supported by Johnston and Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Australia 's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston \u2014 who scored 29 . Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell . Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers , ending with 4 / 100 from 43 overs , while debutant Coxon took 2 / 90 from 35 overs . Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball . He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over . Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32 / 2 . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later . England were 46 / 4 and Australia were firmly in control . Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings , scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes . After the tea break , Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball . Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53 . One run later , Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134 / 6 with their skipper dismissed for 44 . Johnson then removed Evans for nine , before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket . After 85 minutes of resistance , Johnston removed both . England 's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9 / 207 . On the third morning , Lindwall removed Bedser , ending England 's innings at 215 , giving Australia a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall ended with 5 / 70 . The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings . Barnes was given an early life and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122 before Morris was bowled for 62 . Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket . Barnes accelerated after reaching his half-century . Once he reached his century , Barnes became particularly aggressive . He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs , including two successive sixes before finally falling for 141 , caught on the boundary from Yardley . He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings . The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296 / 2 after 277 minutes when he departed . Hassett was bowled first ball , so Miller came to the crease at 296 / 3 to face Yardley 's hat-trick ball . Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball . Bradman fell to Bedser again , this time for 89 . Brown joined Miller at 329 / 4 and Australia reached stumps at 343 , without further loss . After the rest day , the fourth morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 117 runs . Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller , who was out for 74 , followed by Lindwall for 25 . Bradman declared with Australia at 460 / 7 , 595 runs ahead . Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers , with two each . Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times . Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 , before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13 . Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65 / 3 . However , Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106 / 3 . The final day started poorly for England , with Compton being caught off Johnston from the second ball of the day . Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over . Eight runs later , Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer that stayed low . Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141 / 8 . England were bowled out for 186 , ceding a 409-run victory . Toshack ended the innings with 5 / 40 , while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively . The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were \u00a3 43,000 \u2014 a record for a Test in England . = = = Third Test = = = When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short-pitched bowling . The omission generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . Hutton 's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett . England made three further changes . Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department . Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp . Australia dropped Brown , who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings , for the all rounder Loxton . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The change in England 's opening pair did not result in better results . A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball , and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that helped the bowlers . Both fell early , leaving England 28 / 2 . Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves . Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer , but edged it into his face . This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting , resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added . They reached lunch at 57 / 2 . Upon the resumption , Crapp accelerated , hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson . Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37 . Dollery then fell for one . England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 / 4 . After 170 minutes of slow batting , Edrich fell to Lindwall . At 119 / 5 , Compton returned to the field , his wound having been stitched . Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141 / 6 , bringing Evans to the crease . Compton and Evans added 75 runs , before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216 / 7 . England resumed on the second day at 231 / 7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball . Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes , adding 37 and featuring in a 121-run partnership with Compton . Soon after , Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes , who was standing at short leg , forcing him into hospital . The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363 . Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting , having struck 16 fours . Lindwall took 4 / 99 and Johnston 3 / 67 . Barnes 's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener . Johnson was deployed as Australia 's makeshift second opener , but made only one , and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13 / 2 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell . Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126 / 3 at stumps . Australia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Miller fell for 31 . Four runs later , Morris fell for 51 , leaving Australia 139 / 5 . Barnes came in , despite having collapsed in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest . He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell . Lindwall came into bat at 172 / 6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled , leaving Australia 208 / 7 , five runs behind the follow-on mark . Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221 , giving England a lead of 142 runs . During his innings , Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich . One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand , evoking cheers from the crowd . Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers , taking 4 / 81 and 3 / 53 respectively . Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Lindwall did not bounce Edrich , but Miller did , earning the ire of the crowd . Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes . This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook . Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six , but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit . Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball , as England reached 174 / 3 at the close , with Washbrook unbeaten on 85 . The rest day was followed by the fourth day , which was abandoned due to persistent rain . Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day , leaving Australia a victory target of 317 , but the rain meant that the entire first session was lost . The tourists batted in a defensive manner to ensure a draw . They ended at 92 / 1 in 61 overs . Morris finished unbeaten on 54 , his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series . The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test . = = = Fourth Test = = = Australia made two changes for the Test . Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps . England made three changes . Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position . Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young . Dollery , who had made only 38 in three innings , was replaced by all-rounder Cranston . England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch . Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168 , the best by England in the series . Washbrook refrained from the hook shot , which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series . The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall . Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich , the pair batted until late in the first day , when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day . His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs . Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268 / 2 , with Edrich on 41 . The next day , Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich . The pair saw England to lunch without further loss , and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out after almost three hours of batting for 79 . Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes . Edrich fell three runs later at 426 / 4 for 111 . With two new batsmen at the crease , Australia quickly made further inroads to leave England at 473 / 6 . Loxton then successively removed Cranston , Evans and Laker as England fell from 486 / 6 to 496 / 9 , before Miller bowled Yardley to end England 's innings at 496 . The home team had lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs . Loxton took 3 / 55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two . Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury . With Barnes injured , Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris . Morris fell for six , before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63 / 1 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring , finishing unbeaten on 31 . On the third morning , England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 in the same over . This left Australia struggling at 68 / 3 . Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner \" Let 's get stuck into ' em \" . If England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six , but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , prompting Wisden to liken it to a \" hurricane \" . Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England 's firm control . Loxton was particularly severe on Laker , lifting his deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours . At the other end , Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329 / 6 . Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson , and 15 runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 , while Saggers only managed five , leaving Australia at 355 / 8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He was the last man out at 458 , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3 / 92 . Laker took 3 / 113 , while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each . England set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day . For the second time in the match , Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership . Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57 , leaving England at 129 / 2 . Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off , adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54 . England lost wickets at regular intervals late in the day to be 278 / 6 . When Johnston removed Compton for 66 , England were 7 / 293 with no recognised batsmen remaining , having lost 4 / 33 . Wicket-keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362 / 8 at the close of the fourth day . England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365 / 8 , with Evans on 47 not out . Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures , with 4 / 95 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin . This left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce . Only 44 runs came in the first hour . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack ; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121 / 1 . In the half hour preceding the interval , Australia had added 64 runs . Both had given chances , but England fumbled them . Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Compton , who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin , aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs . This prompted Yardley to take the new ball . Australia reached 202 , halfway to the required total , with 165 minutes left . Morris passed his century , and was then dropped on 126 . Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity . Australia reached tea at 288 / 1 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182 , having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required . He fell with eight runs still needed . Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs . Australia had won by seven wickets , setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase , with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours . The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds . The attendance remains a record for a Test in England . = = = Fifth Test = = = With the series already lost , England made four changes to their team . Dewes replaced the injured Washbrook , while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder . Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut . England played two spinners ; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker , while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard 's pace . The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes . Australia made three changes . Off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring . Australia 's second change was forced on them ; the injured seamer Toshack was replaced by the recovered batsman Barnes . The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury . The match saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch . Precipitation during the week meant that the start of the Test was delayed until the afternoon . The humid conditions , along with the rain , assisted the bowlers , with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Miller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2 / 1 , before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10 / 2 . Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch , and Miller then removed Crapp , who failed to score in his 23-ball innings , leaving England at 23 / 4 . After the lunch break , England had struggled to 35 / 4 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston dismissed him for a duck to leave England at 42 / 6 . Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match . Lindwall then removed Evans , Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Tallon , who grasped the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left . In his post-lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16.1 overs . Bradman described the spell as \" the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket \" . Hutton was the only batsman to resist , scoring 30 in 124 minutes from 147 deliveries . No other player passed seven . Miller and Johnston took 2 / 5 and 2 / 20 respectively , and Ring was not needed to bowl . In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , and Morris and Barnes passed England 's first innings total by themselves . The score had reached 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61 , ending a partnership that had taken only 126 minutes . This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day . As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat . Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers . With 6996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket , but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly . Hassett came in at 117 / 2 and Australia closed at 153 / 2 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 . On the second morning , Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett 's fall for 37 . The following four batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20 . Morris was finally removed for 196 , ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving ; it took a run out to remove Morris . Australia were eventually out for 389 . Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took 5 / 131 . England had relied heavily on spin ; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners . England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears . Lindwall made the early breakthrough , and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54 / 1 . Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes . On 39 , Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall . Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64 , having top-scored in both innings , to leave England at 153 / 4 . Thereafter , England collapsed in the fading light , . prompting the umpires to call off play . The ground was then hit by rain , resulting in a premature end to the day 's play . England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178 / 7 . England resumed on the fourth morning and Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs . Johnston ended with 4 / 40 and Lindwall 3 / 50 . This result sealed the series 4 \u2013 0 in favour of Australia . The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches . = = Other matches in Great Britain = = = = = v Worcestershire = = = At Worcester , 28 , 29 , 30 April . Worcestershire ( 233 and 212 ) lost to the Australians ( 462 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 17 runs . The pitch was slow , and the weather was cold and showery for the traditional tour opener against Worcestershire . Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than \u20a4 4000 . The hosts elected to bat , and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137 / 1 after 133 minutes . However , the dismissal of Charles Palmer , who top-scored with 85 , precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233 . Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets , with Johnson taking 3 / 52 . In their sole innings , Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris ( 138 ) and Bradman ( 107 ) . This took them to 265 / 1 , before they declared at 462 / 8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time . Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6 / 135 for the locals . In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs , with 70 minutes to spare . McCool took 4 / 29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets . = = = v Leicestershire = = = At Leicester , 1 , 3 , 4 May . The Australians ( 448 ) defeated Leicestershire ( 130 and 147 ) by an innings and 171 runs . Australia elected to bat , and Miller , who had been promoted to No. 3 , shared century partnerships with Barnes ( 78 ) and Bradman ( 81 ) . A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack , but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century . He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448 . The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler , taking 5 / 91 . Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings ; another Australian expatriate , Jack Walsh , top-scored with 33 . Ring took 5 / 34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs . Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced the prospect of being bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5 / 83 . After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day ; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat . Johnson ended with 7 / 42 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Bradford , 5 , 6 May . Yorkshire ( 71 and 89 ) lost to the Australians ( 101 and 63 / 6 ) by four wickets . This low-scoring game was the closest that Australia came to defeat on the tour . The game was played in cold , blustery , overcast and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers . Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings . Miller mixed medium-paced off-breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6 / 42 . At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4 / 22 from 26 overs . Together the pair bowled almost unchanged , delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs . Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4 / 38 . Miller came in at the start of the second day 's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added , before falling at 7 / 86 , part of a collapse of 5 / 27 . He hit two sixes in his innings , including one from the first ball that he faced , feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions . Australia ended at 101 , and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury . Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire , 6 / 51 . Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings , which followed a similar pattern to their first effort . Wickets fell steadily as Johnston ( 6 / 18 ) and Miller ( 3 / 49 ) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs . Australia were set a target of 60 runs for victory , and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett \" might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch \" . Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down . Australia slumped to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease . Harvey was given two chances , once when he was on one , and Tallon was also missed . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 , but Harvey won the game with a straight drive over the fence . Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece , and at the rate of every four overs . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 8 , 10 , 11 May . The Australians ( 632 ) defeated Surrey ( 141 and 195 ) by an innings and 296 runs . Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for the opening stand before the latter fell for 65 . Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket . Barnes ' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes . After Bradman departed at 403 / 3 , wickets began to fall more regularly , but Hassett held up his end and made 110 , while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50 . Surrey 's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4 / 104 . On the second afternoon , Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings . Johnson took 5 / 53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out , but received little support , the next highest scores being 15 and 10 . Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day . They made continual inroads on the final day , and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win . Johnston took 4 / 40 and Johnson 3 / 40 . = = = v Cambridge University = = = At Fenner 's , Cambridge , 12 , 13 , 14 May . Cambridge University ( 167 and 196 ) lost to the Australians ( 414 / 4 declared ) by an innings and 51 runs . Cambridge elected to bat and wickets fell regularly . No player made over 33 and the hosts were out in the second session of the first day for 167 . Miller was prominent with the ball and in the field , taking 5 / 46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers . In reply , Australia were already 184 / 1 at stumps , with Brown heading for a consecutive century . He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence , who made 92 . Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter , prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414 / 4 , having reached 61 not out himself . In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool , who took 7 / 78 as the match ended early on the third morning . Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000 . = = = v Essex = = = At Southend , 15 , 17 May . The Australians ( 721 ) defeated Essex ( 83 and 187 ) by an innings and 451 runs . After electing to bat , Australia made history on the first day by breaking the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day . Ironically , it was the only time they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour . With centuries from Brown ( 153 ) , Bradman ( 187 ) , Loxton ( 120 ) and Saggers ( 104 * ) , Australia 's first innings totalled 721 ; they were dismissed on the close of the first day 's play . Bradman 's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown 's 153 lasted three hours ; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145 / 1 . Bradman came in and seized the initiative , reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch , including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore . Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364 / 2 only halfway through the day 's play . Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia 's merciless crushing of their hosts , something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman . Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races , but this was refused by Bradman . The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest , but still did not get to go to the races . Later , Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket , before an late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5 / 57 , leaving Saggers unbeaten , but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career . After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen on the first day , Essex made only 83 in their first innings , capitulating within 37 overs . Toshack took 5 / 31 and Miller 3 / 14 , and Australia enforced the follow-on . Essex 's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46 / 6 . However , a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187 . Johnson ended with 6 / 37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day . The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record . = = = v Oxford University = = = At Oxford , 19 , 20 , 21 May . The Australians ( 431 ) defeated Oxford University ( 185 and 156 ) by an innings and 90 runs . Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss , and the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on 139 . Brown scored his third century in succession , before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108 . Morris , Loxton , McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431 . Oxford 's best batting performance came in the form of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings , resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket . Despite Kardar 's innings of 54 and 29 , the top-score in both innings , Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily . The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists ; Toshack took three in each innings , while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match . = = = v Marylebone Cricket Club = = = At Lord 's , 22 , 24 , 25 May . The Australians ( 552 ) defeated Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) ( 189 and 205 ) by an innings and 158 runs . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and with two other capped players , were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first-choice team . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage . After winning the toss , Australia batted first . After the loss of Morris early , Barnes ( 81 ) and Bradman ( 98 ) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160-run stand . Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98 , which took two hours , and Hassett then took over and added 51 . Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407 / 5 . He continued the next day and Australia 's highest scorer with 163 , and Johnson supported him with 80 . Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair 's departure , Australia reached 552 . Bradman 's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker . They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning . Miller and Lindwall then sought to gain an advantage over England 's leading batsmen \u2014 Hutton and Compton \u2014 before the Tests . The MCC side , composed almost entirely of Test players , reached 91 / 2 , Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104 / 5 . He took three more wickets to end with 6 / 51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189 , conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs . Some English observers decried Toshack 's leg stump attack as being negative , but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack 's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played . Bradman opted to enforce the follow on , and his spinners did most of the damage , McCool taking 4 / 35 and Johnson 3 / 37 . Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match , scoring 52 and 64 , and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory . The total attendance was 60,000 . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Manchester , 26 , 27 , 28 May . The Australians ( 204 and 259 / 4 ) drew with Lancashire ( 182 ) . The first day was abandoned due to rain . Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch . The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman 's wicket twice in the match , causing a media sensation . Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11 , the Australian captain 's first score on tour below 80 . The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40 . Australia looked set to concede a lead for the first time on tour as the hosts reached 3 / 129 , but Johnston ( 5 / 49 ) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire 's only innings , which ended on the third morning . With a result impossible , Australia had time for batting practice . Bradman reached 43 , and when Hilton came on , the Australian captain , perhaps perturbed by earlier events , attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack . After missing the first two balls , Bradman charged the third , swung and missed , fell over and was stumped . Harvey ( 76 * ) and Hamence ( 49 * ) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52 . = = = v Nottinghamshire = = = At Nottingham , 29 , 31 May 1 June . Nottinghamshire ( 179 and 299 / 8 ) drew with the Australians ( 400 ) . In Nottinghamshire 's first innings , Ray Lindwall took 6 / 14 from 15.1 overs , with only 10 scoring strokes being made off him . Reg Simpson made 74 and Joe Hardstaff junior 48 , but only one other batsman reached double figures . After their 98-run third-wicket stand was broken , Australia took 8 / 68 to bowl the hosts out for 179 . Lindwall , conceded less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall \" absolutely paralysed \" the batsmen , with some of his bowling \" in the real Larwood manner \" . Australia only batted once , and Brown top-scored with 122 in 3 hours 45 minutes , while Bradman added 86 . The Australia middle-order fell away and the tourists lost their last six wickets for 74 runs . In the county 's second innings , Keeton was hit in the chest by one of Lindwall 's deliveries and took no further part in the match . On the final day , Hardstaff hit the first century against the Australians on the tour , 107 , and Simpson again batted well , making 70 . Lindwall and the Australian pacemen were less incisive in the second innings , and Ring and Johnson took four and three wickets respectively . = = = v Hampshire = = = At Southampton , 2 , 3 , 4 June . Hampshire ( 195 and 103 ) lost to the Australians ( 117 and 182 / 2 ) by eight wickets . Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat against the Australians , who were led by Hassett while Bradman rested . The Australians were behind on the first innings for the first time on the tour and the match remained in the balance until the third afternoon . On a drying pitch , the hosts reached 116 / 3 before losing their remaining wickets for 79 to be all out for 195 , while Johnston took 6 / 74 . In reply , Australia fared worse and collapsed from 2 / 70 and made only 117 . Charles Knott 's off spin proved challenging for the Australians , but Miller scored three successive sixes from him before the collapse , top-scoring with 39 . In their second innings , both Miller and Johnston took five Hampshire wickets . John Arnold top-scored for the hosts in both innings , with 48 and 42 . Australia needed 182 runs in 175 minutes to win . Barnes went for a duck but Johnson , sent in five minutes before lunch , hit 74 out of a second-wicket partnership of 105 , including three sixes and seven fours . Brown , with 81 not out , and Hassett saw the Australians through to victory . = = = v Sussex = = = At Hove , 5 , 7 June . Sussex ( 86 and 138 ) lost to the Australians ( 549 / 5 declared ) by an innings and 325 runs . Lindwall won the match for the Australians with his bowling , taking 11 / 59 . After winning the toss , the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace , and he hit the off-stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6 / 34 . Loxton also bowled well in the first innings , taking 3 / 13 . Australia replied to Sussex 's 86 strongly , and were already 254 / 1 by the end of the first day . Powered by Morris 's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman ( 109 ) and Harvey ( 100 * ) , Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549 / 5 . They then still had time to send down 63.3 overs , enough to finish the match within two days . In Sussex 's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over . Harry Parks made 61 , but Sussex were all out for 138 , losing their last seven wickets for 59 . In all , eight of Lindwall 's wickets were bowled , five these by swinging yorkers , the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that \" Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions \" as Sussex \" crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew \" . At the other end , Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall . He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs . = = = v Northamptonshire = = = At Northampton , 16 , 17 , 18 June . Northamptonshire ( 119 and 169 ) lost to the Australians ( 352 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 64 runs . Starting the day after the First Test , the Northamptonshire match was interrupted by rain . Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7 / 61 before some tail-end resistance took them to 119 ; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each . The Australians passed the locals ' score on the first afternoon , and their innings was built around Hassett 's 127 , which included 17 fours . Morris and McCool also made fifties . Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings , Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each . In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Sheffield , 19 , 21 , 22 June . The Australians ( 249 and 285 / 5 declared ) drew with Yorkshire ( 206 and 85 / 4 ) . The Australians were made to work hard for their 249 , with only Bradman reaching 50 . Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores . Alec Coxon took 4 / 66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test . Yorkshire made 206 in reply , Toshack taking 7 / 81 and Johnston 3 / 101 : together , they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings . Like the Australians , the local batsmen struggled to make the most of their starts ; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40 . Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test , Bradman declared Australia 's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining . Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86 , putting on 154 for the second wicket . Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings . The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result . Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw . The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 30 June , 1 \u2013 2 July . Surrey ( 221 and 289 ) lost to The Australians ( 389 and 122 / 0 ) by 10 wickets . Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat . They made 221 , and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single-figure scores . As the match started the day after the Second Test , Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers , and Ring took three wickets , while the Test players only took two in total . Hamence opened the batting for Australia \u2014 Brown injured a finger while fielding \u2014 but he was out for a duck . Hassett ( 139 ) and Bradman ( 128 ) then put on 231 , Bradman making his sixth century of the tour . However , the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389 . Surrey made 289 in their second innings , with McCool taking 6 / 113 after bowling more than 40 % of the overs . The hosts batted steadily with three fifties , but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised . The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time . = = = v Gloucestershire = = = At Bristol , 3 , 5 , 6 July . The Australians ( 774 / 7 declared ) defeated Gloucestershire ( 279 and 132 ) by an innings and 363 runs . The Australians elected to bat and made the highest score of the tour , and it was also the second biggest score by an Australian team in England ( the 1893 team made 843 against a \" Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present \" at Portsmouth ) , and the highest score by an Australian team versus an English county . Morris 's 290 , made from 466 balls in five hours , was the highest individual score of the tour , and he featured in century stands with Barnes , Miller and Harvey . Loxton made 159 not out , Harvey 95 and McCool 76 . This match preceded the Third Test , and off spinner Tom Goddard was regarded as a candidate for England selection after strong performances in county cricket . However , Morris and Loxton 's aggressive attack gave Goddard figures of 0 / 186 from 32 overs , effectively ending his chances of selection . Former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \" Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . \" Instead , it was Loxton who forced his way into the Third Test . Gloucestershire replied with an innings of 279 , in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out , while Johnson took 6 / 68 . Made to follow on during the final day , the hosts made only 132 , losing their last eight wickets for 60 . Johnson took 5 / 32 to end with 11 / 100 for the match , while Ring took 5 / 47 to end with seven for the match . Australia 's spinners took 19 wickets . = = = v Middlesex = = = At Lord 's , 17 , 19 , 20 July . Middlesex ( 203 and 135 ) lost to the Australians ( 317 and 22 / 0 ) by ten wickets . Denis Compton hit a cautious 62 , but Middlesex lost wickets regularly to fall from 1 / 78 to 203 all out . Five bowlers shared the wickets , Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece . At one stage , Australia were 53 / 3 , but Morris ( 109 ) and Loxton ( 123 ) put on a partnership of 172 . No other batsman bettered Hamence 's 30 , and Jim Sims took 6 / 65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46 . Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings , with only John Dewes ( 51 ) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists , while eight managed only single figures . Five bowlers shared the wickets , and McCool was the only one to take three . McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs . = = = v Derbyshire = = = At Derby , 28 , 29 , 30 July . The Australians ( 456 ) defeated Derbyshire ( 240 and 182 ) by an innings and 34 runs . The Australians chose to bat first , and Brown top scored with 140 , his first 50 taking three hours . He shared century stands with Bradman , who made 62 , and Miller ( 57 ) . Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings , losing 7 / 142 . Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57 , while Miller , Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece . The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs . In their second innings they made 182 , with Denis Smith making 88 , the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians . However , only one other player reached double figures , as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9 / 72 , taking 6 / 77 , while Loxton took 3 / 16 . There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day . = = = v Glamorgan = = = At Swansea , 31 July , 2 \u2013 3 August . Glamorgan ( 197 ) drew with the Australians ( 215 / 3 ) . Rain prevented play after 3pm on the second day . No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197 , with the four Australian bowlers , Lindwall , Miller , Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets . The Australians ' 215 / 3 was based on an aggressive 84 from Miller , with five sixes and seven fours , and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett , who was 71 not out when the rain came . The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000 . = = = v Warwickshire = = = At Birmingham , 4 , 5 , 6 August . Warwickshire ( 138 and 155 ) lost to the Australians ( 254 and 41 / 1 ) by nine wickets . Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet pitch and the hosts struggled to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs . Martin Donnelly ( 28 ) was the only batsman to pass 20 , and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each . Australia scored 254 in reply ; Hassett top-scored with 68 , Lindwall made 45 , and the pair 's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match . Three other batsmen reached 30 , but most of the Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin of Eric Hollies , who opened the bowling and took 8 / 107 , the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour . This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call-up for the fifth and final Test . In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs , Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each , the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs . Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Old Trafford , Manchester , 7 , 9 , 10 August . The Australians ( 321 and 265 / 3 declared ) drew with Lancashire ( 130 and 199 / 7 ) . Cyril Washbrook 's benefit match brought him a then record sum , \u00a3 14,000 , but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test . The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes ( 67 ) reaching 50 . Nine of the Australians made a start , reaching 14 , but could not capitalise on their opportunities , and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123 . The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6 / 73 . Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38 , while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece , but the Australians did not enforce the follow on . Australia made 265 / 5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133 , his highest at Old Trafford , with 90 for Barnes . Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match , but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day . Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers . Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller , who refused to bowl , saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century . Lindwall ( 4 / 27 ) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century . = = = v Durham = = = At Sunderland , 11 , 12 August . The Australians ( 282 ) drew with Durham ( 73 / 5 ) . In the absence of the resting Bradman , Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . Attendance was 17,000 on the first day of this two-day non-first-class match . Rain prevented any play on the second day . After a poor start that saw them fall to 22 / 3 , McCool ( 64 ) and Miller ( 55 ) made half-centuries for the Australians . Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20 , but none went on . Paceman Keith Jackson took 5 / 76 for the hosts . Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match . = = = v Kent = = = At Canterbury , 21 , 23 August . The Australians ( 361 ) defeated Kent ( 51 and 124 ) by an innings and 186 runs . Australia elected to bat first and Brown made 106 , while Bradman ( 65 ) and Harvey ( 60 ) both scored half-centuries . Kent collapsed to the lowest score of the tour in the first innings , succumbing in only 23 overs . Johnston and Loxton both took 3 / 10 , and six local batsmen made ducks . Forced to follow on , half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings . Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71 , but the match , held in front of record crowds for the ground , ended inside two days , soon after Evans was run out . It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets . Lindwall took 4 / 37 in the second innings ; all his wickets were top-order batsmen . = = = v Gentlemen of England = = = At Lord 's , 25 , 26 , 27 August . The Australians ( 610 / 5 declared ) defeated the Gentlemen of England ( 245 and 284 ) by an innings and 81 runs . In his last match at Lord 's , Bradman won the toss and made his ninth century ( 150 ) of the tour against a side composed almost entirely of Test players . Brown ( 120 ) and Hassett ( 200 * ) also scored centuries , and Miller made 69 . Bradman elected to bat into the second day . The Gentlemen responded with 242 of which Reg Simpson made 60 and , following on , 284 , with Bill Edrich making 128 . There were no other scores beyond 30 in either innings . Ring took 5 / 70 for the innings and eight for the match , while Johnson secured seven wickets . The Victorian spin duo bowled the majority of the overs in both innings . = = = v Somerset = = = At Taunton , 28 , 30 August . The Australians ( 560 / 5 declared ) defeated Somerset ( 115 and 71 ) by an innings and 374 runs . After winning the toss , the Australians made all their runs on the first day , with centuries for Hassett ( 103 ) , Harvey ( 126 ) and Johnson ( 113 * ) and 99 for Hamence . The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket , through Hassett and Barnes , who was replaced by Harvey after retiring ill . The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries , and were keen to see Hamence do the same . The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone , only to see him stumped for 99 , his highest score for the season . On the Monday , the second day , on a pitch that was taking spin , Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total . McCool took 4 / 21 and 4 / 23 , and Johnston also took eight , including 5 / 34 in the second innings . He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner , and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls . = = = v South of England = = = At Hastings , 1 , 2 , 3 September . The Australians ( 522 / 7 declared ) drew with the South of England ( 298 ) . The tourists elected to bat and after losing the openers early , Hassett top scored with 151 , his third consecutive century . He was supported by Bradman ( 143 ) and Harvey ( 110 ) , whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total . Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey . Harvey 's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day . The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain , and Compton made 82 in the showers . Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4 / 16 in 4.1 overs to finish off the tail , the only time he bowled in first-class matches on the entire tour . There was no time left for the second innings . = = = v HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI = = = At Scarborough , 8 , 9 , 10 September . HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI ( 177 and 75 / 2 ) drew with the Australians ( 489 / 8 declared ) . This was the final match for Bradman in England , and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions . It was Australia 's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full-strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Ring . The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat , but Lindwall took 6 / 59 in an innings that lasted into the second day , bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively , sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62 . Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face , breaking his nose . Australia reached 2 / 407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8 / 469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result . Leveson-Gower 's XI played out time , with Bradman bowling the last over . = = = v Scotland = = = At Edinburgh , 13 , 14 September . The Australians ( 236 ) defeated Scotland ( 85 and 111 ) by an innings and 40 runs . The match against Scotland was a two-day fixture that did not have first-class status . Australia elected to bat and Morris top-scored with 112 , and McCool made 52 , but all struggled against the leg-spin of William Laidlaw , who took 5 / 51 . The Australians collapsed at the end , losing their last six wickets for 36 runs , and only three made double figures . Scotland collapsed against Johnston and Johnson , who took 6 / 15 and 3 / 18 respectively . Forced to follow on , a second innings opening stand of 50 preceded a second collapse , this time Ring and Morris took 4 / 20 and 5 / 10 . Only three Scottish players passed double figures in either innings . = = = v Scotland = = = At Aberdeen , 17 , 18 September . Scotland ( 178 and 142 ) lost to the Australians ( 407 / 6 declared ) by an innings and 87 runs . In another two-day non-first-class match , Scotland batted better than in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat , but still lost . Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts ' 178 , before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool , promoted to open , made 108 , while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5 . Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring . Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball , and the wickets were shared , with nobody taking more than four .",

It was the fourth event under the Against All Odds chronology and the second event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule . Nine professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card , four of which involved championships , while two matches were held prior to the event . The main event was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Samoa Joe as Special Outside Enforcer between then-champion Kurt Angle and the challenger Christian Cage .

On the January 31 , 2008 episode of Impact ! , Tomko defeated Angle after interference from Cage . This resulted in Tomko and Cage seeming to be on the same page on the February 7 , 2008 episode of Impact ! . The main storyline in TNA 's X Division revolved around Team 3D 's ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) attempt to eliminate the X Division . This feud began on the October 18 , 2007 episode of Impact ! when Team 3D attacked The Motor City Machine Guns ( Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin ; MCMG ) and proclaimed they were going to eliminate the X Division .

                    "text": "Survivor Series ( 1993 ) = Survivor Series ( 1993 ) was the seventh annual Survivor Series pay-per-view professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . It took place on Thanksgiving Eve , November 24 , 1993 , at the Boston Garden in Boston , Massachusetts . The event consisted of four tag-team elimination matches and a bout for the Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship . The main event match saw the All-Americans , a team of face wrestlers from the United States , competing against the Foreign Fanatics , a team of heels that represented other countries . The All-Americans won the match when Lex Luger was the last man remaining . In an undercard match , four members of the Hart family competed against Shawn Michaels and a group of masked men . The original plan was for the Harts to face Jerry Lawler , with whom they were feuding , but Lawler was not able to appear at the event . The Harts won the match , but a confrontation between Bret Hart and Owen Hart after the match led to Owen turning against the family the following year . The majority of the feuds remained unresolved and carried on to future events . Bam Bam Bigelow was scheduled to face his main rival , Doink the Clown , but Bigelow 's team ended up facing four other wrestlers wearing clown makeup instead . Matches from the Survivor Series also helped set up feuds for Royal Rumble 1994 , the WWF 's next pay-per-view . Razor Ramon 's rivalry with Irwin R. Schyster intensified at Survivor Series and led to Ramon defending his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Schyster at the Royal Rumble . This event also marked the beginning of The Undertaker 's feud with Yokozuna , and Yokozuna defended his WWF Championship against The Undertaker at the Royal Rumble . = = Background = = Several feuds surrounded the opening match , which saw the team of Razor Ramon , Marty Jannetty , the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid and Mr. Perfect face the team of Irwin R. Schyster ( I.R.S. ) , Diesel , Rick Martel , and Adam Bomb . Diesel made his WWF debut on June 6 , 1993 as a bodyguard for Shawn Michaels in a match between Michaels and Jannetty . Diesel 's interference in the match helped Michaels to defeat Jannetty and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship . Diesel was also at ringside to help Michaels when Michaels faced Mr. Perfect for the title belt at SummerSlam 1993 . Diesel attacked Perfect on multiple occasions during the match and ultimately caused Perfect to lose the match via countout . In September 1993 , Michaels was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship by WWF President Jack Tunney . A battle royal was scheduled to determine the top two contenders for the championship . Ramon and Martel were the last two wrestlers in the ring , and they faced each other in a title match on the September 27 episode of Monday Night Raw . Ramon won the match and was awarded the championship belt . Schyster had initiated a feud with Ramon in May 1993 after Ramon lost a match to The Kid ( later the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid ) , who was competing as a jobber at the time . Schyster and his tag team partner Ted DiBiase made fun of Ramon for the loss and offered him a job as a servant . In response , Ramon teamed with the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid for a series of matches against Schyster and DiBiase , and he also distracted Schyster during a match and caused him to lose to jobber P.J. Walker . Adam Bomb was not involved in any feuds with his opponents at Survivor Series , but there was animosity between Bomb and his teammate Rick Martel . Bomb 's manager , Harvey Wippleman , was at ringside to help Martel in a match against Ramon . Wippleman was standing in the way of the match , and Martel ran in to him . While Martel was distracted , Ramon pinned him to win the match . Martel then yelled at Wippleman and pushed him . Bomb came to the ring to defend his manager , and an argument ensued until Diesel and Schyster came to the ring to calm their teammates . Jerry Lawler spent much of 1993 building a feud with the Hart family . Lawler had been using the nickname \" The King \" since defeating Jackie Fargo for the AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship in 1974 . After Bret Hart won the WWF 's 1993 King of the Ring tournament , Lawler confronted him and claimed to be the only king in the WWF . Lawler then attacked Hart from behind , hitting Hart with the scepter and throne that had been set up for the coronation ceremony . The feud escalated when Lawler involved Helen and Stu Hart , Bret 's parents , by insulting them while serving as commentator for WWF television programs . In what was billed as a \" Family Feud \" match , Bret Hart was joined by his brother Owen , who also worked for the WWF at the time , as well as his brothers Bruce and Keith , both of whom had also wrestled professionally . Lawler 's partners were three masked wrestlers known only as the Blue Knight , the Red Knight , and the Black Knight . Lawler was unable to appear at the event , however , as he was indicted after being accused of raping and sodomizing a teenage girl , who later admitted to making up the story . Shawn Michaels , who replaced Lawler in the match , also had a rivalry with Bret Hart dating back to the previous year . Hart , who held the Intercontinental Championship for much of 1992 , defended the belt against Michaels many times , including in the WWF 's first ladder match . They had also wrestled each other in the main event of Survivor Series 1992 , when Hart defended his newly-won WWF Championship against Michaels . The Smoky Mountain Wrestling Tag Team Championship was defended at Survivor Series as part of a working agreement between WWF owner Vince McMahon and Smoky Mountain Wrestling ( SMW ) owner Jim Cornette . The Rock ' n ' Roll Express , who held the belts going into the event , had been feuding with The Heavenly Bodies over the title for over a year . The rivalry had been violent at times , including a barbed wire cage match and a Texas deathmatch . Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow throughout October and November with such pranks as throwing water and confetti on him and dumping a pail of water on Bigelow 's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon . He also tied a tripwire across the aisle during one of Bigelow 's matches ; after Bigelow fell over the wire , Doink attacked him with a broom . Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink 's matches and destroying Doink 's toy wagon . The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers , who occasionally appeared at the same time . The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger , who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton , and The Headshrinkers ( Samu and Fatu ) , a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages , to face four Doinks . To promote the match , Doink appeared on the video wall that was part of the set during Bigelow 's matches leading up to the event . The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time . In the main event , the team of the All-Americans , which consisted of Lex Luger , Tatanka , and the Steiner Brothers ( Rick and Scott Steiner ) faced the Foreign Fanatics , which consisted of Yokozuna , Ludvig Borga , and The Quebecers ( Jacques and Pierre ) . The main storyline behind the match began that summer when Yokozuna , a Japanese sumo wrestler , challenged any American athlete to bodyslam him on the deck of the USS Intrepid during an event on Independence Day . After several challengers were unable to lift Yokozuna , Luger arrived via helicopter and successfully performed what was termed \" the bodyslam heard around the world \" . Luger was granted a match for Yokozuna 's WWF Championship at SummerSlam . Luger got a victory via countout but did not win the title . In the dressing room after the match , Borga , a Finnish wrestler , interrupted Luger 's celebration by criticizing Luger and initiating a new feud . The Steiner Brothers spent the fall 1993 feuding with The Quebecers , a Canadian tag team . They had faced each other several times since The Quebecers had won the WWF Tag Team Championship from the Steiners on September 13 . Since arriving in the WWF , Tatanka had been on a two-year winning streak . Borga ended the streak on the October 30 , 1993 episode of WWF Superstars by pinning Tatanka after hitting him with a chair . After the match , Borga and Yokozuna attacked Tatanka , causing kayfabe injuries that forced Tatanka to withdraw from the match at Survivor Series . The All-Americans recruited The Undertaker to replace Tatanka . On the November 15 episode of Monday Night Raw , Luger defeated Pierre ; as a result of a kayfabe injury in the match , the Foreign Fanatics had to replace Pierre with Crush , the sole American of the team . Crush was feuding with Randy Savage going into the event . They had been on-screen friends , but Crush was angry that Savage had not saved him from an attack by Yokozuna on the July 12 , 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw . To make his injuries seem real , Crush did not appear on WWF television programming for several months . He made his return on October 18 , accompanied by Yokozuna 's manager , Mr. Fuji , claiming that they sympathized with Crush 's sense of betrayal by Savage . Savage tried to make amends with Crush , who then attacked Savage and announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States and was aligning himself with Yokozuna , Fuji , and Japan . = = Event = = Prior to the televised broadcast , Billy Gunn defeated The Brooklyn Brawler in a dark match . The first match on the pay-per-view event saw Razor Ramon , Randy Savage , the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid , and Marty Jannetty face Diesel , Irwin R. Schyster , Rick Martel , and Adam Bomb . Prior to the match , Ramon announced that Savage was taking the place of Perfect , who was unable to appear . Martel and Ramon began the match in the ring , but Martel soon tagged out to bring Bomb into the match . Ramon performed a suplex on Bomb and attempted to pin his opponent . Martel tried to rescue his partner but ended up hitting Bomb instead and causing an argument . The 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid entered the match but was overpowered by Bomb and Diesel . After the Kid tagged out , Savage performed a diving elbow drop on Diesel before getting the pinfall to eliminate Diesel from the match . Ramon was attacked by his opponents but eventually tagged Savage back into the match . Savage got distracted when Crush appeared in the aisle , however , which allowed Schyster to eliminate him from the match . Ramon then performed a Razor 's Edge on Schyster and pinned him . Ramon attempted the same move on Martel , but Schyster snuck back into the ring and hit Ramon with a briefcase . Ramon fell out of the ring and was counted out of the match . The remaining four wrestlers fought back and forth , but the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid eventually pinned Martel after a sunset flip . Almost immediately , Jannetty performed a sunset flip on Bomb to win the match for his team . The next bout was the \" Family Feud \" match that saw the Hart brothers ( Bret , Owen , Bruce , and Keith ) facing Shawn Michaels and His Knights . The knights wore masks to hide their identities , but it has been revealed that Jeff Gaylord was the Black Knight , Greg Valentine was the Blue Knight , and Barry Horowitz was the Red Knight . Ray Combs , then host of Family Feud , told jokes to insult Shawn Michaels prior to the bout and later served as guest commentator for the match . Michaels began the match by wrestling Bruce Hart . Although Michaels was able to go on the offensive against the Hart brothers , the knights were unable to achieve much success against the Harts . At one point , all four wrestlers brawled in the ring , but Owen was able to eliminate the Black Knight after performing a missile dropkick . Michaels and the knights regained control of the match , but Bret turned things around by eliminating the Red Knight via submission to the Sharpshooter . Bret sustained a kayfabe injury after being thrown out of the ring and sat out of the match for a few minutes . Meanwhile , Michaels provoked Stu Hart into punching him . Inside the ring , Owen forced the Blue Knight to submit to the Sharpshooter , which left Michaels by himself . While Bret was standing on the ring apron , however , Owen ran in to him and got distracted . This allowed Michaels to pin Owen and eliminate him from the match . Bret dominated the rest of the match against Michaels until Michaels walked back to the locker room . As a result , Michaels was counted out , and the Harts won the match . After the match , Owen returned to the ring and yelled at Bret , blaming Bret for causing him to be eliminated from the match . All four men began the SMW Tag Team Championship match in the ring . The Rock ' n ' Roll Express ( Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson ) controlled most of the opening of the match with aerial maneuvers against The Heavenly Bodies ( Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Pritchard ) . Del Ray tried to help his partner but superkicked him instead . The Heavenly Bodies gained the advantage after Pritchard performed a powerbomb on Morton , which Del Ray followed with a moonsault . Del Ray and Morton fought back and forth , with Del Ray performing another moonsault and Morton executing a hurricanrana . After all four wrestlers brawled in the ring once more , Del Ray hit Gibson in the back with a tennis racquet . Pritchard then pinned Gibson to win the belts for The Heavenly Bodies . The next match pitted Bam Bam Bigelow , Bastion Booger and The Headshrinkers ( accompanied by Luna Vachon and Afa ) against a team calling themselves the Four Doinks . After Bigelow 's team was introduced , Doink the Clown 's theme song began to play , but immediately switched to the theme of The Bushwhackers and Howard Finkel introduced the pair as Luke Doink and Butch Doink as they came down wearing clown wigs , with Luke riding a scooter and Butch pulling a wagon . As the fans waited to see who would be the other two Doinks , the intro to Doink 's theme played again and the two Doinks were joined by Mabel Doink and Mo Doink with their rapping manager Oscar Doink ; as they came to the ring they were referred to by Bobby Heenan as \" Doinks on a Mission \" . Headshrinker Samu was eliminated first after he bit several of the balloons being carried by his opponents . He was purposely offered one more balloon by the Doinks , which he willfully bit into . Samu was stunned to find out that the balloon was full of water , which caused him to stumble back in surprise and Luke rolled him up and pinned him . Later , Booger has a chance to pin Luke after he hit the Trip to the Batcave on him . However , Booger got off of Luke and went to the corner where Headshrinker Fatu offered him a banana . As Booger was looking to perform the move again , his teammates dragged him away and Booger landed on his knees . Luke and Butch performed their trademark battering ram on Booger . Mabel then executed a leg drop on Booger and pinned him . Down four wrestlers to two , Bigelow 's team appeared to be making a comeback when Fatu began taking down his opponents with the carcass of a turkey that Afa had been eating from the entire match . He then performed a top rope splash onto Mo . Fatu got distracted , however , and examined a banana peel with curiosity . Butch entered the ring with a bucket and faked out Fatu by making like he was going to toss the contents of the buckrt onto him . This resulted in Fatu slipping on the banana peel , and Butch pinned him to eliminate him from the match . Left by himself , Bigelow began brutally atracking three of the Doinks and seemed to get the upper hand when Mabel entered the ring and Bigelow was unable to do much to him . Meanwhile , Butch dumped a bucket of confetti all over Luna , which caused Bigelow to become momentarily distracted and Mabel and Mo sandwiched him in the corner . Bigelow fell , Mabel performed a splash on him , and the referee counted the pin as the other three Doinks piled on . After the match , the real Doink the Clown appeared on the video screen to taunt Bigelow . In the final match of the evening , The All-Americans , consisting of Lex Luger , The Undertaker , and The Steiner Brothers ( Rick and Scott ) , competed against the Foreign Fanatics ( Yokozuna , Ludvig Borga , Quebecer Jacques , and Crush ) . Scott Steiner and Jacques began the match , but Scott soon tagged in his brother Rick . Rick knocked Yokozuna out of the ring , but he was unable to perform much offense against Borga . Rick attempted a crossbody , during which Borga was supposed to catch him . Borga botched the move , but he pinned Rick anyway to eliminate him from the match . Crush faced Scott Steiner inside the ring , but Randy Savage then appeared in the aisle trying to get to the ring but was restrained by officials and The Smoking Gunns . Scott knocked Crush out of the ring , and Crush fought with Savage until being counted out of the match . Scott then turned his attention to Jacques before tagging Luger into the match . Luger eliminated Jacques with an elbow drop and a pinfall . Scott Steiner re-entered the match and executed a superplex on Borga . When he tried to pin Borga , however , Yokozuna entered the ring . Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Steiner and pinned him to even the match at two wrestlers each . Luger fought with Borga and Yokozuna before tagging The Undertaker into the match . The Undertaker gained control of the match , but Yokozuna turned the momentum around by performing his signature move , the Banzai drop , on The Undertaker . When he attempted the move a second time , The Undertaker sat up . The two men then fought outside the ring until both were counted out and eliminated from the match . Luger and Borga then fought back and forth until Luger performed a running forearm smash and pinned Borga to win the match . After the match , Santa Claus came to the ring to celebrate with Luger . = = Aftermath = = Razor Ramon continued with two of his feuds after Survivor Series . Irwin R. Schyster stole Ramon 's gold chains , which set up a match for the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1994 . Despite interference from Shawn Michaels , Ramon pinned Schyster to retain the title . Michaels and Ramon then faced each other at WrestleMania X. Diesel got involved , but Ramon won the match . Ramon then defended his title against Diesel on April 13 , 1994 . Diesel won the match and became the new WWF Intercontinental Champion . Ramon regained the belt in a rematch at SummerSlam 1994 , however . Meanwhile , the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid and Marty Jannetty continued with their push from the promotion and won the WWF Tag Team Championship on January 10 , 1994 . Owen Hart challenged Bret Hart to a match after Survivor Series , but Bret refused to fight his brother . The two reunited to face The Quebecers for the Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994 . Bret sustained a kayfabe injury during the match , which forced the referee to stop the match . Owen blamed Bret for the loss and attacked him after the match . They faced each other at WrestleMania X , where Owen defeated Bret . The rivalry continued , however , and the brothers feuded throughout 1994 and into 1995 . Bret 's feud with Lawler remained , but the two did not face each other again until In Your House 1 in May 1995 . The feud was reignited at that time , and they feuded at several pay-per-view events in 1995 . Bam Bam Bigelow 's feud with Doink the Clown remained unresolved for several months . They were in the ring at the same time during the main event of the 1994 Royal Rumble , which was a battle royal-style match . Bigelow attacked Doink and eliminated him from the match . The blow off match came at WrestleMania X , where Doink and his midget sidekick Dink faced Bigelow and his girlfriend Luna Vachon in a mixed tag team match . Bigelow and Vachon won the match to settle the feud . The Steiner Brothers continued to challenge The Quebecers , but they were unable to regain the Tag Team Championship . As a result of their confrontation at Survivor Series , The Undertaker and Yokozuna faced each other at Royal Rumble 1994 in a casket match for Yokozuna 's WWF Championship . Mr. Fuji , Yokozuna 's manager , recruited several heel wrestlers to help Yokozuna win the match . The Undertaker supposedly died and disappeared from the WWF for several months , although , in reality , he was simply recovering from injuries . He resumed the feud with Yokozuna upon his return , however , and defeated Yokozuna in a casket match at Survivor Series 1994 . Luger also continued his rivalry with Yokozuna . As a co-winner of the 1994 Royal Rumble match , Luger was granted a shot at Yokozuna 's WWF Championship . Mr. Perfect , who had returned to the WWF , was the referee for the match and turned heel by disqualifying Luger during the match . Ludvig Borga was scheduled to continue his feud with Tatanka in a match at Royal Rumble 1994 . Borga sustained a legitimate ankle injury , however , and never returned to the WWF . WWF writers had also planned to have Borga feud with Luger , but they were forced to drop the storyline because of Borga 's departure . Crush and Randy Savage also continued their feud . They fought each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1994 until Crush eliminated Savage . To end the rivalry , they faced each other in a Falls Count Anywhere match at WrestleMania X , which Savage won . = = = Reception = = = The attendance for the event was 15,509 , which generated $ 180,000 in ticket sales . This was the lowest attendance for a Survivor Series event since 1989 . The pay-per-view buyrate was 0.82 , down from 1.4 the previous year , and was the lowest buyrate in Survivor Series history to that point . The event has been rated by several sources . Adam Gutschmidt , writing for Online Onslaught , stated that \" many of the substitutions hurt the matches \" and that \" the main event was bland \" . The Other Arena opined that the Four Doinks match was the worst on the card and that the confrontation between Lex Luger and Ludvig Borga was boring . Scott Criscuolo and Justin Rozzero reviewed the event for The History of WWE . Both writers gave Survivor Series 1993 a \" C \" rating and viewed the Family Feud match as the worst on the card . Matt Peddycord , writing for 411mania.com , gave the event a 5.5 out of 10 rating .

                    "text": "Unforgiven ( 2005 ) = Unforgiven ( 2005 ) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . It was the seventh annual Unforgiven event and took place on September 18 , 2005 , at the Ford Center in Oklahoma City , Oklahoma . The event featured wrestlers and other talent that performed on the Raw program . To date , it is the only WWE pay-per-view event ever to be held in the state of Oklahoma . The main event was a standard wrestling match , in which Kurt Angle defeated WWE Champion John Cena , after Cena used the Championship belt on Angle , leading to a disqualification . In WWE , a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification , as a result , Cena retained the title . Two featured bouts on the undercard was another standard match , in which Shawn Michaels defeated Chris Masters . The other primary match was a steel cage match , where the ring is enclosed by a steel cage , in which Matt Hardy defeated Edge . Unforgiven grossed over $ 485,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of approximately 8,000 , and received about 243,000 pay-per-view buys . This amount was higher than the following year 's event . When the event was released on DVD , it reached a peak position of third on Billboard 's DVD Sales Chart . = = Background = = Eight professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event 's card beforehand , which were planned with predetermined outcomes by WWE 's script writers . The buildup to these matches and scenarios that took place before , during and after the event were also planned by the script writers . The event featured wrestlers and other talent from Raw 's brand \u2013 a storyline expansion in which WWE assigned its employees . Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick , as they followed a series of events which generally built tension , leading to a wrestling match . The main rivalry written into Unforgiven was between John Cena and Kurt Angle , who were competing for Cena 's WWE Championship . At SummerSlam , Cena defeated Chris Jericho to retain the WWE Championship . A rematch was held on the August 22 episode of Raw , one of WWE 's primary television programs , when authority figure Eric Bischoff , a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer , announced a match between Cena and Jericho in a \" You 're Fired \" match , in which the loser would be fired . The match saw Cena win , and Bischoff was scripted to fire a pleading Jericho , who was carried out of the arena by security . This angle was written after WWE 's official website confirmed that Jericho signed a short-term contract extension to stay with the company after his long-term contract expired , which presumably ended after his loss to Cena . Kurt Angle came down to the ring and attacked Cena by lifting Cena on his shoulders and spinning 90 \u00b0 to slam him down to the mat , a move Angle calls the Angle Slam . As Cena was down , Bischoff announced that Angle was the new contender for the WWE Championship , claiming that Jericho \" couldn 't get the job done \" . Angle continued his attacks on Cena before their scheduled match at Unforgiven . On the August 29 episode of Raw , Cena was scheduled in a Handicap match , a match where one wrestler or team of wrestlers face off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as two against one , or three against two . He faced Tyson Tomko and Angle . Cena won the match by pinning Tomko after lifting Tomko onto his shoulders and slamming him down to the mat . Afterwards , Angle assaulted Cena , which led to Angle being scripted to smash Cena 's ankle across the ring post , thus giving Angle the advantage heading into Unforgiven . Another major rivalry heading into the event was between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters . This feud began the night after SummerSlam , where Michaels lost a match to Hulk Hogan . Michaels admitted he fell victim to Hogan 's leg drop , a move where Hogan drops his legs across the opponent 's head or chest . He concluded that Hogan was the better man and it was time to get \" back to reality \" . Mid-way through Michaels ' speech , Masters interrupted him and informed Michaels that individuals like Hogan and Michaels did not know how to pass the torch to new wrestlers . Michaels went along with Masters ' comments and warned Masters to not group him with Hogan . Masters concluded by stating that he was not \" trying \" to steal the spotlight from Michaels , but that he was going to \" take it \" . Michaels responded by saying that he knew where Masters was coming from , which led to Michaels slapping Masters . The two then brawled , thus turning Michaels into an on-screen hero , as he had been a villain in rivalry between Hogan . On the September 5 episode of Raw , Michaels was involved in the Masterlock Challenge , a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Master 's full Nelson submission hold , which he calls the Master Lock . Despite Michaels ' best efforts , he could not break free . Upset at the vigorous resistance of Michaels , Masters released the hold and hit Michaels with a steel chair before re-applying the hold . The following week , Michaels issued a challenge to Masters at Unforgiven , in which he vowed to get revenge on Masters for his actions the previous week . The other predominant rivalry heading into the event was between Matt Hardy and Edge , a real life issue transformed into a storyline . At SummerSlam , Edge defeated Hardy after dropping him onto the top of a ring post . This was scripted to caused Hardy to bleed heavily , which forced the referee to end the match and declare Edge the winner because Hardy could not continue . The next night on Raw , Hardy had a match with Rob Conway , in which Conway pinned Hardy for the win . After the match , Edge attacked Hardy . On the August 29 episode of Raw , Edge and Hardy were scheduled to compete in a Street Fight , a match where there are no disqualifications , no countouts , and scoring conditions can occur anywhere in the arena . The match ended in a no-contest after Hardy and Edge brawled at the stage ramp . Hardy grabbed Edge by the side and threw both himself and Edge off the stage and into electrical equipment . Both Hardy and Edge laid motionless on the floor as sparks flew everywhere . Trainers and emergency medical technicians rushed to the scene and took both men away in ambulances for medical attention . The following week , Bischoff booked Hardy and Edge in a steel cage match at Unforgiven , where the ring would be enclosed by a steel cage . Following the announcement , Bischoff scheduled a match between Hardy and Snitsky , which Hardy lost . After the match , Snitsky threatened to hit Hardy with a ring bell but The Big Show came down . He was unable to stop Snitsky , and as a result , Snitsky succeeded in hitting Hardy with the bell . The Divas rivalry heading into the event was between Ashley Massaro and the stable known as Vince 's Devils . A week after winning the Diva Search , Massaro was attacked by Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle , who were traded to Raw , after they pretended to congratulate her , turning both Torrie and Candice into heels . After their villainous turns , Torrie and Candice aligned with Victoria to form Vince 's Devils , and the trio spent weeks tormenting her , which included Massaro suffering a pair of losses to Victoria and Torrie . On the September 12 edition of Raw , Trish Stratus returned from injury and helped Massaro fight off the Devils , leading to the announcement that Torrie and Victoria would face Massaro and Stratus at Unforgiven . = = Event = = Before the event went live on pay-per-view , Rob Conway defeated Tajiri in a match taped for Heat , one of WWE 's secondary television programs . = = = Preliminary matches = = = The first televised match was a standard wrestling match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship , which involved the champion Carlito and challenger Ric Flair . The match began with Flair taking down Carlito with a series of headlock takeovers . Carlito was able to hit Flair with his forearm , but Flair brought Carlito down with an Inverted atomic drop . Flair later went for the figure four leglock , but Carlito reversed it . After back and forth action between the two , Flair took the advantage and applied the figure four leglock on Carlito . By making him tap out , Flair became the new Intercontinental Champion , the oldest in WWE history at 56 . The next match was a tag team match featuring the team of Trish Stratus and Ashley against the team of Victoria and Torrie Wilson ( with Candice Michelle as Victoria and Wilson 's manager ) . The match started off with Wilson and Stratus in the ring . Wilson tagged in Victoria , who applied a full-body choke on Stratus , but Stratus started to work on Victoria 's arm . Victoria countered Stratus ' arm takedown . Stratus then performed a takedown by scissoring Victoria 's head with her legs and forcefully dragging her down to the mat . Back and forth action continued ; the match , however , came to an end when Stratus was able to perform a roundhouse kick on Victoria , giving the pinfall victory to Stratus and Ashley . The third match was a standard match between The Big Show and Snitsky . The match began with Big Show and Snitsky brawling as the bell rang . Big Show was able to perform a big slap to the chest and headbutt . Snitsky then took the upper hand over Big Show , as he applied an armbar hold , after countering a chokeslam , a move where The Big Show lifts the opponent by the throat and slams them down to the mat . Big Show then made a comeback when he lifted Snitsky by the waist and slammed him down to the mat . Big Show then got the victory after a successful chokeslam . The next match was another standard match involving Shelton Benjamin and Kerwin White . White tried to get in the ring , but Benjamin slid out and tripped him . Benjamin threw White into the ring barricade , which led him to throw him back in the ring as the bell rang to officially start the match . In the ring , Benjamin lifted and slammed White to the mat , which followed by a running forearm . White retaliated with a dropkick to Benjamin 's knee . The match concluded after White grabbed a golf club that he hid in the steel steps and tried to assault Benjamin with it . Benjamin , however , countered by throwing White up in the air and catching him by slamming him down to the mat . Benjamin covered White and got the pinfall victory . The fifth match was a Steel Cage match contested between Matt Hardy and Edge , who was accompanied by Lita . As the bell rang , Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into the cage wall but did not succeed . Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge . Lita began to climb up the outside of the cage , but Hardy hit the cage , making Lita fall off . As Lita distracted Hardy , Edge started to crawl out . Hardy noticed this , grabbed Edge , and threw him into a corner . Lita interfered , which led to Hardy grabbing Lita 's head in a forward position and forcefully pulling it down over his shoulders . Hardy turned around and was hit with a spear but he kicked out . Hardy knocked Edge off the turnbuckle Hardy got to the top of the cage and delivered a leg drop before covering Edge for the victory . = = = Main event matches = = = The next match was Rosey and The Hurricane taking on Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship . The match started with Hurricane and Cade locked up ( that is , grappling ) . Cade managed to gain the advantage over Hurricane with some fists . During the match , Murdoch drove Hurricane 's head into the floor on the outside of the ring . WWE Medical trainers came to ringside to check on Hurricane . The match concluded when Cade pinned the legitimately injured Hurricane , to win the World Tag Team Championship . The seventh match was a standard match between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters . The match started with Masters applying the Masterlock on Michaels . After breaking the hold , Michaels hit Masters with his forearm and slapped his chest several times . Masters , however , dominated Michaels , focusing on his back by lifting and sitting Michaels onto his shoulders and slamming him down to the mat several times . He also lifted Michaels vertically in the air and stalled him there before slamming him down . Michaels fought back , as he drove his cocked elbow onto Masters ' chest . Masters was able to lock in the Masterlock once more . Michaels tried to use the corners to break the hold , but Masters kept it locked on . Michaels then leaped over the top rope and landed on the ring apron , causing the referee to order Masters to break the hold . Michaels countered with a Sweet Chin Music , thus Michaels got the pinfall victory over Masters . The main event was between John Cena and Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship . The match began with Angle and Cena locking up , leading to Angle taking Cena down with a headlock takeover . Cena countered many attacks by Angle and was able to reverse the ankle lock . Cena tried to lift Angle onto his shoulders to slam him down to the mat , but Angle reversed it and lifted Cena on his shoulders and spun 90 \u00b0 to slam him down . Eric Bischoff came down the ramp and cheered for Angle , who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena . Cena rolled out of the move , grabbed the championship belt , which Bischoff had brought with him , and hit Angle with it . The referee saw this and called for the bell . As a result , Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship , ultimately resulting in him retaining his title . = = Aftermath = = The feud between John Cena and Kurt Angle , with the involvement of Eric Bischoff , continued . During Raw episodes , it saw Angle and Bischoff interfere in Cena 's matches , and even deciding the outcome of Cena 's matches . On the October 17 episode of Raw , Bischoff announced that a standard match involving three wrestlers , termed as the Triple Threat match , for the WWE Championship , would take place between Cena , Angle and the fans ' choice at Taboo Tuesday .

It was the fourth event under the Hard Justice name and the eighth event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule . Seven professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's card , three of which were for championships . The main event was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship , in which the champion Samoa Joe defeated the challenger Booker T to retain the title . Another heavily promoted bout was a Last Man Standing match between Kurt Angle and A.J. Styles , which the latter won . The card also featured a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship , which saw Beer Money , Inc . ( James Storm and Robert Roode ) defeat The Latin American Xchange ( Hernandez and Homicide ) to become the new champions . A New Jersey Street Fight was also held pitting the team of Christian Cage and Rhino against Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) . Cage and Rhino were the victors in the contest .

Hard Justice had a reported attendance between 2,300 and 3,500 people . Canadian Online Explorer writer John Pollock reviewed the show and felt it featured the \" usual assortment of wacky finishes and outside interference \" but that \" all in all it was a solid show . \" Wade Keller and James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter both reviewed the event , praising the Last Man Standing match saying it was a \" superb \" and \" epic match . \" = = Production = = = = = Background = = = The fourth installment under the Hard Justice name was announced in January 2008 with an August 10th date attached . In May , TNA hoped to host a PPV event in the Northeastern United States sometime before the end of the year . Hard Justice was the PPV under consideration . TNA issued a press release in late-June revealing that Hard Justice would be held at the Sovereign Bank Arena in Trenton , New Jersey . Tickets for the show went on-sale on June 27 . TNA released a poster to promote the event featuring the The Latin American Xchange ( Hernandez and Homicide ; LAX ) and Samoa Joe ; the poster also promoted a musical appearance by rap artists Filthee , Grandmaster Caz , and Ice-T. The official theme for the show was \" AyAyAya \" by Filthee . = = = Storylines = = = Hard Justice featured seven professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . The main event at Hard Justice was a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion Samoa Joe and the challenger Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA 's Slammiversary PPV event on June 8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title , which Joe won to remain champion . The duo also fought at TNA 's previous PPV event Victory Road on July 13 , which ended in a no contest after interference from Sting allowed Booker T to gain an unofficial pinfall counted by his legitimate wife Sharmell instead of an official referee . On the July 17 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! , Booker T proclaimed that he was the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion before Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T did not win the match and that Joe was still the TNA World Heavyweight Champion , despite Booker T having taken possession of the title belt . Cornette then scheduled a rematch between the two for the title at Hard Justice ; Joe did not retrieve physical possession of the title belt after this , instead chose to reclaim the physical belt after he beat Booker T at the event . On the July 24 episode of Impact ! , Joe and Booker T made the contest a Six Sides of Steel Weapons match . The predominate storyline heading into the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle , both members of The Angle Alliance . On the February 14 episode of Impact ! , TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle 's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen . Afterwards , Karen and Angle separated in the storyline on the March 13 episode of Impact ! . TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May 15 episode of Impact ! ; TNA began to phase out the marriage between Styles and Karen also . Karen refused Angle 's request on the May 22 episode of Impact ! , leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles . This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen . The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June 12 episode of Impact ! , which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles , Angle , Tomko , Christian Cage , Rhino , Abyss , and Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) . Afterwards , Team 3D and the team of Cage and Rhino became involved in the feud with Team 3D joining Angle , while Cage and Rhino sided with Styles . The two teams then fought in a Full Metal Mayhem at Victory Road , which the team of Angle and Team 3D won . The teams fought again on the July 24 episode of Impact ! , this time in a Six Man Tag Team Elimination Tables match , which Angle and Team 3D also won . On the July 31 episode of Impact ! , while Styles stood in a ring surrounded by a steel cage , Angle attacked Styles from behind and slammed him back-first into the mat , rendering him unconscious . As a result of this action , Styles challenged Angle to a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice ; Angle accepted the challenge . The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended at Hard Justice by LAX against Beer Money , Inc . ( James Storm and Robert Roode ) . On the June 12 episode of Impact ! , Roode and Storm teamed to face LAX for the World Tag Team Championship .

However , the attendance number has been disputed , with it also being reported that Hard Justice drew an attendance of 2,300 people . Canadian Online Explorer writer John Pollock reviewed the show and felt it featured the \" usual assortment of wacky finishes and outside interference \" but that \" all in all it was a solid show . \" Pollock commented on the musical performance shown at the beginning of the telecast , stating the \" crowd is silent in appreciation . \" \" Crowd is very hot for this opener and the atmosphere should hopefully add to this show , \" stated Pollock when covering the TNA X Division Championship match . Pollock discussed the Street Fight in his review , commenting that the \" crowd was really hot for this match . \" As for the Last Man Standing match , Pollock said it \" was an outstanding match . \" Pollock also felt that the main event got \" zero time . \" Pollock noted that the fans in attendance started chanting \" Fire Russo \" during the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match in his review , which was a reference to TNA writer Vince Russo . Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter rated the matches out of five stars in his review of the event . He gave the main event 2 3 / 4 stars and discussed the amount of time it was given , stating it was \" just enough time for a suitable main event \" but that it did not \" leave much flex time for things to run past the bare minimum for a PPV main event title match in a cage much less do whatever they 're going to do with Sting and Nash . \" Keller also disapproved of unprotected use of weapons in the bout , commenting that TNA management needed to start fining \" wrestlers for taking unprotected chairshots to the skull \" because it was \" just not worth the long-term cumulative risks associated with blunt trauma to the skull over years of wrestling . \" He gave the Last Man Standing bout 4 stars and said it was a \" superb match \" with a \" scaring finish \" since the \" potential for something going wrong given Angle 's legit neck problems was substantial \" even if \" everything was planned \" to work out that way . Keller rated the Street Fight 1 1 / 2 stars and stated it \" was pretty clunky late and early on the crowd brawling got a little repetitive \" and that it felt \" like yet another weapons match . \" \" The match was okay , but nothing more . The tuxedos and chain served as more of a circus-like distraction than a valuable prop for the match , \" said Keller in his coverage of the Black Tie Brawl and Chain match , which he gave 1 1 / 4 stars . Keller gave the World Tag Team Championship match 2 stars , but did not give his opinion outside the rating on the contest . He did comment on the X Division Championship match , saying it was a \" very good match \" and gave it 3 stars . James Caldwell , also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter , published a review of the show in which he also gave ratings out of 5 stars and some comments on the top matches on the card . He considered the main event \" underwhelming \" due to the \" audience having sat through every possible gimmick match combination prior to another Joe-Booker bout that everyone knew was going to end with some sort of gimmicky finish \" and that it was \" not memorable \" but that it would \" generate talk about Jarrett . \" He gave the bout 2 stars . \" That was an epic match , \" said Caldwell when discussing the Last Man Standing match . However , he felt the bout had a \" silly pin-and-count- ' em stipulation \" and that the \" all-too-real neck injury angle , followed by some post-match activity that took away from Styles 's win . \" Caldwell felt the match made Styles look \" like a star when he won , then he came across like a punk attacking Angle , then a fool being in position for Sting to take him out \" but that he had a \" memorable , star-making victory over Angle . \" He disapproved of Styles being \" used a means to the end of explaining Sting 's purpose-driven TNA life . \" Caldwell rated the encounter 4 stars . As for the Street Fight , he said it was a \" fun brawl for the audience \" and gave it 2 1 / 2 stars . Caldwell believed that the World Tag Team Championship match had \" good heat \" that \" over-rode the stream of outside interference , referee incompetence , and overall over-booking \" and that it was \" refreshing to see TNA use an injury angle from TV to set-up the finish of an important PPV match . \" He gave the match 3 stars . The X Division Championship match was given 3 stars and he said it would have been \" great \" if it had avoided involving \" outside interference . \" = = Aftermath = = The feud between Samoa Joe and Booker T ended after Hard Justice .

On January 23 , 2006 , they had their WWE television debut as a group , appearing on Raw and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry \" The King \" Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler .

                    "text": "SummerSlam ( 1988 ) = SummerSlam 1988 was the first annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view event . It was produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) and took place on August 29 , 1988 , in Madison Square Garden , located in New York City , New York . The pay-per-view was created to help the company compete against rival promotion World Championship Wrestling ( formerly Jim Crockett Promotions ) . It was one of the first four annual pay-per-view events produced by the WWF , along with WrestleMania , the Royal Rumble , and Survivor Series . The event consisted of ten professional wrestling matches . The preliminary matches included a title defense by Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man against a surprise challenger , who turned out to be The Ultimate Warrior . The Ultimate Warrior won the match in approximately thirty seconds to end the longest Intercontinental Championship reign . The main event was a match pitting The Mega Powers ( Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage ) against their long-time rivals , The Mega Bucks ( Ted DiBiase and Andr\u00e9 the Giant ) . Hogan and Savage won the match after Miss Elizabeth , Savage 's manager , distracted the Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase , by removing her skirt to reveal a bikini bottom . = = Development = = In the late 1980s , Vince McMahon 's World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) ' s main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions . McMahon countered Jim Crockett 's successful Starrcade pay-per-view , which began airing in 1983 , by creating the WrestleMania franchise . After WrestleMania III in March 1987 , the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history , McMahon created the Survivor Series franchise , which aired the same day as Starrcade 1987 in November 1987 . After defeating Crockett in the ratings war , McMahon created the Royal Rumble , an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988 . The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event . In retaliation , Crockett created the Clash of the Champions event , which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV . WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings , and not long after , Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner , who renamed it World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) . As the WWF continued to replace its closed circuit programming with pay-per-view programming , McMahon added more pay-per-views to the lineup to capitalize on the success of his previous events . In addition to WrestleMania in March , Royal Rumble in January , and Survivor Series in November , McMahon created an event for August , which he named SummerSlam . To keep the WWF from having a pay-per-view market monopoly , Turner began airing monthly WCW pay-per-views . As a result , both companies brought in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue . SummerSlam became one of World Wrestling Federation 's most successful events and one of the \" Big Four \" pay-per-views , along with WrestleMania , Survivor Series , and Royal Rumble . Those four events , along with the King of the Ring , are known as the \" Classic Five \" . = = Background = = Prior to SummerSlam , The Honky Tonk Man , a villainous character , had been the longest reigning Intercontinental Champion in WWF history . He was originally supposed to defend his championship against Brutus Beefcake , but Beefcake was unable to compete as a result of a ( storyline ) injury received from \" Outlaw \" Ron Bass the week before . Also prior to the event , Demolition ( Ax and Smash ) held the WWF World Tag Team Championship , which they had won at WrestleMania IV after only a year in the WWF , and would defend their titles at SummerSlam against former champions The Hart Foundation ( Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart ) , who had become fan favorites a few weeks earlier by turning on their manager Jimmy Hart . The on-screen feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began weeks before SummerSlam . As part of his gimmick , Rude would \u2014 after winning a match \u2014 invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring . On one occasion , one of the women refused to comply , later identifying herself as Robert 's wife , Cheryl . As the feud intensified , Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them , prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude , appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked , although the live audience saw him stripped to a g-string instead . For months prior to the pay-per-view , Hulk Hogan and undisputed WWF Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage , two of the WWF 's top crowd favorites , had feuded with Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Ted DiBiase , respectively . The two feuds first came together at WrestleMania IV , when \u2014 as the result of the vacating of the WWF Heavyweight Championship \u2014 a 14-man single-elimination tournament was set up to crown a new champion . Hogan and Andr\u00e9 had been disqualified in their quarterfinal match , while Savage and DiBiase reached the championship match ; in that final match , Savage defeated DiBiase with help from Hogan . Savage and DiBiase feuded over the title throughout the spring and summer , but Andr\u00e9 did not become involved until mid-summer when he and DiBiase helped instigate a 2-on-1 attack against Savage as he was delivering a promo . Savage quickly recovered and challenged Andr\u00e9 and DiBiase to a tag team match against him and a partner to be named . That partner later was revealed to be Hogan ; the team became known as \" The Mega Powers . \" The Andr\u00e9-DiBiase team \u2014 which dubbed itself \" The Mega Bucks \" \u2014 retaliated by announcing the guest referee would be someone they declared to be fair and neutral : Jesse Ventura , a color commentator on the WWF 's programs who favored the villains , though according to the main storyline , Ventura was chosen by WWF President Jack Tunney as the only person capable of handling such a match . = = Event = = The event began with a match between The British Bulldogs ( Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid ) and The Fabulous Rougeaus ( Jacques and Raymond Rougeau ) . As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun , Smith attacked Jacques . The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid over their heads so that he fell on his back to the mat . Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner , Smith , and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques . Despite having the upper hand , The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time , and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw . The next match was between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera . Before the bell rang , however , Brown attacked Patera , who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner . Patera then slipped both of his arms underneath Brown 's armpits and locked his hands behind his neck , using a submission move known as a full nelson . At the end of the match , Brown defeated Patera by striking him in the back of the head with his finishing move , the Ghetto Blaster . After the second match ended , Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog made their way to the ring . Their match began as Rude attacked Junkyard Dog from behind , who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times . Subsequently , Rude climbed to the wrestling ring 's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them . As a result , Jake Roberts , Cheryl Roberts ' husband , ran to the ring and attacked Rude , forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog . The next match was a tag team match between The Powers of Pain ( The Barbarian and The Warlord ) , who were accompanied by their manager The Baron , and The Bolsheviks ( Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff ) , who were accompanied by Slick . Immediately , The Powers of Pain chased The Bolsheviks from the ring . Slick , however , distracted The Powers of Pain long enough to give The Bolsheviks an advantage . Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope , which allowed The Barbarian to pin him . The fifth match of the event was an Intercontinental Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and the reigning champion The Honky Tonk Man , who was accompanied by Jimmy Hart . Before the match it had been announced that Honky 's original challenger , Brutus Beefcake , was unable to wrestle . Prior to the match , the Honky Tonk Man refused to be informed about Beefcake 's replacement and immediately before the match , even grabbed ring announcer Howard Finkel 's microphone and said \" Give me someone out here to wrestle , I don 't care who it is \" . His challenge was answered by The Ultimate Warrior . Warrior , who accidentally knocked Finkel to the floor when he rushed into the ring and hit the ropes , had the advantage from the beginning , attacking The Honky Tonk Man , who was still in his entrance attire . After body-slamming him to the mat and following it up with a clothesline , The Warrior bounded to the ropes and landed stomach-first on The Honky Tonk Man using his signature move , the Warrior Splash . The Ultimate Warrior then pinned The Honky Tonk Man after only thirty seconds to win the title . The longest Intercontinental title reign in WWF history had ended with one of the shortest IC title matches in history . This match was probably the one where the audience cheered the loudest ; the moment the Warrior defeated the hapless Honky Tonk Man , the fans erupted with cheers , with many even voting it the match of the year . The following contest was a re-match from WrestleMania IV between Dino Bravo and Don Muraco . Muraco , the crowd favorite , was in control for most of the match until Bravo 's manager Frenchy Martin distracted Muraco , allowing Bravo to use his side suplex and pin him for the win . The seventh match of the night was for the WWF Tag Team Championship . Reigning champions Demolition ( Ax and Smash ) , accompanied by both Mr. Fuji and Jimmy Hart , were challenged by The Hart Foundation ( Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart ) . As soon as the bell sounded , The Hart Foundation attacked both members of Demolition . Their control was brief , as Demolition then gained the advantage over Neidhart . As Bret Hart was tagged into the match , Neidhart chased Jimmy Hart from ringside and returned to tag back into the match . When all four men began fighting inside the ring , Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji , who was on the ring apron . At the end of the match , Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him with Jimmy Hart 's trademark megaphone . Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win . The next match was between the Big Boss Man , accompanied by Slick , and Koko B. Ware . With Slick as a distraction , the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match . After crushing Ware in between himself and the turnbuckle , Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match . Instead , he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Ware stomach-first , but missed . Ware then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin . Boss Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned , and he slammed his opponent into the mat , allowing him to pin Ware for the win . The second to last match of the night was between Jake Roberts and Hercules . When Roberts attempted to slam his opponent 's head on to the mat with a DDT , Hercules was able to escape the maneuver and take control of the match . As Hercules attempted to slam Roberts to the mat , Roberts reversed the move into a DDT , enabling him to pin Hercules for the win . The last match of the night was the main event between The Mega Powers ( Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage ) , accompanied by Miss Elizabeth , and The Mega Bucks ( Ted DiBiase and Andr\u00e9 the Giant ) , accompanied by Andr\u00e9 's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase 's bodyguard Virgil . Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee . The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase . After Hogan attacked Andr\u00e9 the Giant , who was on the ring apron , The Mega Bucks were able to regain control . After a while , all four men began brawling , and Andr\u00e9 knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring . Subsequently , as part of the scripted ending to the match , Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura , the referee , and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear . While the Mega Bucks were distracted , Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase , followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase . As Hogan pinned DiBiase , Ventura , a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks ( despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner ) , began an obviously slow three-count . As a result , Savage slammed Ventura 's arm down for the third time , indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match . = = Aftermath = = The Mega Powers continued to team together after the event , until a new storyline was developed where Randy Savage became jealous over Hulk Hogan paying attention to Miss Elizabeth , and as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion felt slighted over his perceived lower billing in the Mega Powers ' pecking order . Several key events were developed to foreshadow their burgeoning feud . These included Hogan asking Elizabeth to accompany him to televised matches , where he would act overly friendly with her ; and accidentally eliminating Savage from the Royal Rumble in January 1989 by knocking him over the top rope and to the floor . The final falling out happened on The Main Event , when Elizabeth received an on-screen injury during a tag team match . Savage , left alone in the ring while Hogan tended to Elizabeth , attacked Hogan backstage . This rivalry culminated in a match for Savage 's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V , where Hogan won the title by pinning Savage . As WWF Intercontinental Champion , the Ultimate Warrior began receiving more on-air time and more prominent matches . His feud with the Honky Tonk Man continued for several months , until Warrior was placed in a new feud with Rick Rude in early 1989 . After retaining their title against The Hart Foundation , Demolition held the WWF Tag Team Championship for another 11 months , as part of a record-breaking 16-month reign as champions , before eventually losing the title to The Brain Busters ( Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson ) on the Saturday Night 's Main Event . During the midst of their title reign , despite being billed as villains , Demolition 's popularity with fans continued to grow , and the tag team eventually was turned face at the 1988 Survivor Series . = = Production and reception = = The event was produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) and took place on August 29 , 1988 in New York City 's Madison Square Garden . The pay-per-view had a 4.5 buyrate , which means that 4.5 % of pay-per-view subscribers ordered the event . The original plan for SummerSlam was to bring Ric Flair over from the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) to the WWF . Vince McMahon , the owner of the WWF , wanted Flair to challenge Savage in the main event for the WWF Championship . Flair , however , felt obliged to the NWA and did not leave the promotion for the WWF . Therefore , Hogan and Savage were paired together to end their feuds with their respective on-screen rivals . In WWE.com 's 2007 list of the top ten SummerSlam moments in history , The Ultimate Warrior 's Intercontinental Championship title win was listed as number ten , while Miss Elizabeth 's distraction during the main event was listed at number nine . Calum Waddell , in Fighting Spirit Magazine , called The Ultimate Warrior 's win over the Honky Tonk Man \" genuinely captivating , \" and he said the match between The British Bulldogs and The Fabulous Rougeaus was an \" exciting battle \" . In contrast , he had a negative reaction to the main event match , citing it as \" predictably one-dimensional \" and \" abysmal \" . Similarly , Adam Nedeff of 411mania.com called the tag team match between The British Bulldogs and The Rougeaus \" a solid match \" but stated that the \" lack of a finish was a disappointment \" . Although he reviewed most of the matches negatively , he called the WWF World Tag Team Championship match a \" good match \" . Overall , he rated the event a 4.5 out of 10 and stated , \" Without Warrior 's big win and Elizabeth 's surprise finish , this is a totally forgettable show . \" = = Results = =",

Cardozo High School in Queens , New York , but wrestled part-time during his vacation time and on weekends . He resigned from his position as a teacher , however , when the school found out that he was using sick days as an excuse to keep up with his wrestling commitments . According to the school system 's Special Commissioner of Investigation , Kaye falsely claimed 11 sick days in December 2004 and February 2005 , during which time he was actually wrestling in Japan for Pro Wrestling Zero1 . Kaye later said in an interview that he would have taken personal days instead of sick days , but he \" didn 't know there was a difference . \" The Special Commissioner of Investigation recommended Kaye 's dismissal and also recommended that he should be considered ineligible for future employment in the public schools . Kaye , who was not tenured , chose to resign in April 2005 upon advice from his lawyer . = = Professional wrestling career = = = = = Early career ( 2000 \u2013 2005 ) = = = After being trained by Johnny Rodz at Gleason 's Gym in New York City , Kaye made his debut in 2000 . He initially worked for small independent promotions and quickly achieved success , winning 10 different championships during his first year . He also participated in the King of the Ring 2002 commercials . He wrestled for World of Unpredictable Wrestling ( WUW ) , where he won the WUW Continental Championship , Total Professional Wrestling , where he won the Light Heavyweight Championship and held the Tag Team Championship with Red Flair , and the East Coast Wrestling Association , where he won the ECWA Tag Team Championship with Ace Darling in February 2003 .

On June 19 , Striker and Diamond lost the USA Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship at a USA Pro Wrestling Show . A few hours later that same night , he appeared at a Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling ( 3PW ) show as \" The Ultimate Striker \" , an impersonation of the Ultimate Warrior and teamed with Rob Eckos in a loss to \" Slyck \" Wager Brown and April Hunter . He also appeared for 3PW impersonating \" The Macho Man \" Randy Savage , The Sandman , Sabu , Hulk Hogan , and Ric Flair . On August 21 , 2004 , he and Eckos entered a tag team battle royal as The Bushwhackers , The Road Warriors , and the team of The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff . While working full-time as a teacher in 2004 , he continued to wrestle during his vacation time and weekends , and using sick days .

After the revelation that Kaye was a teacher appeared in mainstream news publications , Kaye made a WWE second appearance on the July 11 , 2005 episode of Raw to face Angle for a second time , again using the name Matt Martel . His news coverage was played up by Angle , who told the audience that Martel was really Striker , and Angle defeated him again in under three minutes . The following week , he appeared on Raw again , still claiming to be called Matt Martel , and challenged Angle again . Angle exposed him as Matt Striker again , before defeating him for the third consecutive time . Striker went on to compete on Heat and appear in WWE 's developmental territory , Deep South Wrestling . Striker developed a heel ( villainous ) teacher gimmick , calling WWE his school and hosting a segment called Matt Striker 's Classroom on Raw , which debuted on December 12 . During the segment he ridiculed the audience , and treated the crowd as intellectual inferiors . During a match against Lance Cade at an untelevised event on December 18 , Striker suffered a shoulder injury . He was out of action until January 23 , 2006 , when he continued his Classroom segments once again , and then appeared mainly on Heat for several weeks . Striker would reappear on Raw on April 17 for another classroom segment where he claimed that \" school is cool \" . Carlito , another wrestler , took exception to Striker 's statement , and spat an apple in Striker 's face , in keeping with Carlito 's gimmick . Striker returned to Raw in-ring action on April 24 and participated in a six-man tag team match , in which he , Chris Masters and Shelton Benjamin were defeated by Carlito , Rob Van Dam , and Charlie Haas . During the Backlash pay-per-view , Striker hosted an edition of his classroom segment , with Eugene , who in storyline was mentally impaired , as his guest . Eugene attacked Striker during the segment , which led to Striker attacking Eugene with a dictionary the following night on Raw . The scripted feud between the two also involved Carlito , who attacked both Eugene and Striker after Eugene inadvertently caused Carlito to lose a match to Striker by Disqualification on the May 8 episode of Raw . The feud between the two ended when Eugene gained a mentor in \" Hacksaw \" Jim Duggan and defeated Striker , after losing to him only two weeks before . Following his loss to Eugene , Striker attacked him , but was stopped by Duggan , and ran away . Striker appeared only rarely on Raw throughout June and July , and his final match for the brand was on July 31 , when he was quickly defeated by John Cena . = = = = Matt Striker 's classroom and The New Breed ( 2006 \u2013 2008 ) = = = = At the end of August 2006 , Striker left the Raw brand to join ECW , making his debut on August 23 . He continued his Classroom segment on ECW , which provoked a feud with The Sandman as Striker insulted him . During one Classroom segment on September 5 , 2006 , however , Striker made a controversial remark that alluded to the death of Australian wildlife expert Steve Irwin , who had been killed by a stingray 36 hours earlier . Due to the outrage caused by the remark , the incident was edited out of the replayed Australian broadcast and WWE Chairman Vince McMahon released a public apology on WWE 's official website following the incident . Striker made his in-ring debut for the brand on the September 19 , 2006 episode of ECW , teaming up with Mike Knox and Test to face Tommy Dreamer , Sabu , and The Sandman . Striker , Knox , and Test lost the match by disqualification due to Test pushing the referee . Striker continued his feud with The Sandman until the October 17 episode of ECW , when The Sandman defeated Striker in a Singapore Cane on a Pole match . At the December to Dismember pay-per-view , Striker faced Balls Mahoney in a \" Striker 's Rules \" match , which meant that no eye gouging , hair pulling , top rope attacks , or foul language was allowed .

On February 6 , Striker aligned himself with Mr. McMahon 's New Breed stable ( faction ) , along with Elijah Burke , Kevin Thorn , and Marcus Cor Von . The New Breed immediately engaged themselves in a feud with the ECW Originals ( Rob Van Dam , Tommy Dreamer , Sabu and The Sandman ) . Different members of the New Breeds wrestled members of the ECW originals over several weeks , leading up to WrestleMania 23 . At WrestleMania , the New Breed was defeated by the ECW Originals in an 8-man tag team match , but won a rematch on the following episode of ECW . In the midst of the feud with the ECW Originals , tension began to appear between the leader Elijah Burke and Striker , after Striker and Cor Von were defeated by the debuting Major Brothers . As a result , Striker began trying to avenge the loss to the Major Brothers , and defeated Brett Major on the May 22 episode of ECW . The feud with the Originals lost momentum , however , as Sabu was released from his WWE contract in mid-May , and at the One Night Stand pay-per-view , the feud ended when Striker , Cor Von , and Burke lost to Dreamer , Sandman , and CM Punk in a tables match .

Nine professional wrestling matches and two pre-show matches were featured on the card , three of which were for championships . The main event at Unbreakable was a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship , in which then-champion Christopher Daniels defended the title against the challengers A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe . Styles ended up gaining the pinfall in the bout , thus winning the title . The NWA World Heavyweight Championship was defended in a Raven 's Rules match between then-champion Raven and the challenger Rhino . Raven pinned Rhino in the encounter to retain the championship . A Four Way Elimination Tag Team match for the NWA World Tag Team Championship was held at Unbreakable , in which then-champions The Naturals ( Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens ) defeated the teams of Alex Shelley and Johnny Candido , America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) , and Team Canada ( A-1 and Eric Young ) to remain champions .

The main event was ranked by TNA as the fourth greatest moment in the company 's history . Corey David Lacroix of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show an 8 out of 10 , stating \" TNA 's Unbreakable PPV was an astounding buffet of action , catering to the variety of tastes among professional wrestling fans . \" = = Production = = = = = Background = = = Unbreakable was announced in June 2005 to take place on September 11 , 2005 .

Raven then performed his signature Raven Effect DDT maneuver on Jarrett , forcing his head into the ring mat . Afterwards , Raven performed the Raven Effect DDT on Rhino and covered for the pinfall victory to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at 14 minutes and 28 seconds .

He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match . The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10 , while a 7 out of 10 was given to the NWA World Tag Team Championship contest . Commenting on the main event , Lacroix spoke of it as a \" certified match of the year candidate . \" Going onto describe in detail : \" Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event , featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title . Now , this is the part where I go into a detail review of the match , but I 'm not going to that . Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was . \" Regarding the Four Way Elimination match , Lacroix believed Johnny Candido 's participation was \" a nice gesture \" , but wonder \" if they could have come up with something else , preferably outside of the match . \" James Caldwell of the Pro Wrestling Torch published a review of the show . In his review he stated that the main event was an \" amazing , special match \" , which he felt was \" pro wrestling at its finest in 2005 . \" As for the Raven 's Rules match , Caldwell thought it was a \" brutal hardcore match \" , which was a \" good adrenaline rush but nothing separated the match from previous TNA hardcore matches . \" Regarding the NWA World Tag Team Championship bout , Caldwell say it was a \" decent tag match that could have been much better if Waltman and Shelley were around at the end where the formula could have been changed up . \" Wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer bestowed a rare 5 Star match rating to the Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship main event between A.J. Styles , Christopher Daniels , and Samoa Joe . TNA released a DVD counting down the top 50 moments in their history in 2007 , with the Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship ranked at number 4 . = = Aftermath = = The Three Way main event began an extended storyline revolving around the participants . At Bound for Glory , A.J. Styles defeated Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match to retain the TNA X Division Championship . TNA then held a Four-on-Four Tag Team Elimination X match at TNA 's Genesis PPV event on November 13 . In that match , Team Ministry ( Alex Shelley , Daniels , Samoa Joe , and Roderick Strong ) defeated the team of Austin Aries , Chris Sabin , Matt Bentley , and Sonjay Dutt . After the contest , Joe assaulted Daniels , performing his signature Muscle Buster maneuver on him twice , the second time on a steel chair . Daniels suffered an injury in the storyline due to the attack , sidelining him until December 11 at TNA 's Turning Point PPV event . At that event , Daniels saved Styles from an assault by Joe following Joe 's victory over Styles to win the TNA X Division Championship . Daniels then challenged Joe for the championship at TNA 's Final Resolution PPV event on January 15 , 2006 , but Joe retained the title . At TNA 's Against All Odds PPV event on February 12 , 2006 , Daniels , Joe , and Styles competed in another Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship ; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title . The three competed again , but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA 's Destination X PPV event on March 12 , 2006 . Daniels won , becoming the new TNA X Division Champion . The rivalry ended on the April 13 , 2006 episode of Impact ! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship . TNA promoted an Unbreakable rematch at their 2009 Turning Point PPV event on November 15 . This time it was a Three Way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between Styles , Daniels , and Joe . Styles won the match to retain the championship .

Following Unbreakable , Raven lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Jeff Jarrett at a Border City Wrestling event on September 15 after interference by America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ; AMW ) and Scott D 'Amore to win the championship . Raven did not receive a rematch for the title . Instead , Jarrett was scheduled to defend the championship against a returning Kevin Nash at Bound for Glory . Nash could not attend the event due to a legitimate medical emergency , with TNA holding a Ten-Man Gauntlet match to find his replacement at the show . Rhino won the match and took Nash 's place in the main event . There , Rhino defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship .

Despite not appearing on the show , Waltman was in Orlando and dressed to compete , but did not arrive at the arena in time . Waltman was not used by TNA until January 15 , 2006 when he appeared at their Final Resolution PPV event . = = Results = = Four Way Elimination Tag Team match 1 . ^",

M\u00e1scara Dorada 's real name has not been officially documented , a tradition in Mexican Lucha Libre where masked wrestler 's real names often are not a matter of public record . The wrestler currently known as M\u00e1scara Dorada made his debut in 2005 and has worked under other names , but achieved most success as M\u00e1scara Dorada . His ring name is Spanish for \" Golden Mask \" . At one time , M\u00e1scara Dorada was a quadruple CMLL champion , holding the Mexican National Trios Championship , the CMLL World Trios Championship , the CMLL World Super Lightweight Championship and the CMLL World Welterweight Championship at the same time . He is also the wrestler who has held the CMLL World Welterweight Championship , having held it four times in total . After a decade of working for CMLL in his native Mexico , Dorada signed with the Japanese promotion New Japan Pro Wrestling ( NJPW ) in January 2015 . After a year with NJPW , Dorada returned to CMLL in January 2016 . He made his in ring debut in 2005 , originally using the masked persona Plata II and later on would use the ring name \" Metallik \" where he held the local Occidente Welterweight Championship , but abandoned it when he was given the M\u00e1scara Dorada character . The \" M\u00e1scara Dorada \" was the first instance of a regular luchador being given a character based on a Mini-Estrella as he was introduced after CMLL introduced Mascarita Dorada in 2007 . = = Professional wrestling career = = = = = Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre ( 2005 \u2013 2016 ) = = = The luchador who would later be known as M\u00e1scara Dorada made his debut on July 14 , 2005 , after training with Gran Cochisse and El Sat\u00e1nico . His initial ring persona was that of Plata II , a copy of the original Plata that wrestled in the early to mid 1990s . His run at Plata II was short lived as he was quickly repackage as Metalik , a variation of the \" Metal based \" look that he also used as \" Plata II \" . As Metalik he worked mainly for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre 's ( CMLL ) Guadalajara branch , getting experience while working on a local level . On April 13 , 2008 Metalik defeated wrestler Depredador for the Occidente Welterweight Championship , the local Welterweight title . About a month later Metalik won his first ever Luchas de Apuestas match , winning the hair of Jeque . The title win and hair win indicated that CMLL had plans for Metalik 's future . Metalik was entered in the 2008 Torneo Gran Alternativa , where a newcomer teams up with a veteran , Metalik teamed up with Dos Caras , Jr. and made it all the way to the finals before losing to \u00daltimo Guerrero and Drag\u00f3n Rojo , Jr . In 2007 CMLL signed Mascarita Sagrada 2000 , but were not allowed to call him that as a rival promotion owned the copyright to the name . Instead CMLL chose to repackage the Mini luchador as Mascarita Dorada .

He remains the last undisputed middleweight champion , having unified the WBA , WBC , IBF , WBO , The Ring magazine and lineal titles in 2005 by beating Bernard Hopkins . This made Taylor the first boxer to ever claim each title from all four major boxing sanctioning organizations . He is also a two-time former IBF middleweight champion , having won the title for a second time in 2014 . Taylor made his professional debut in 2001 and won his first 25 bouts , which included victories over former champions Ra\u00fal M\u00e1rquez and William Joppy . Taylor , who began boxing officially at age 13 , earned numerous accolades throughout his amateur career , starting with his achievement of the 1996 Under-19 Championship . He went on to win a pair of Police Athletic League ( PAL ) Championships and National Golden Gloves titles and he finished second and third at the 1997 and 1998 United States Championships , respectively . In 1998 , Taylor won a bronze medal at the Goodwill Games . Then , in 2000 , he earned a spot on the U.S. Olympic boxing team , becoming the first boxer from Arkansas ever to compete in the Olympic Games .

Taylor controlled the fight by using his jab and right hand throughout the one-sided contest . Near the end of the ninth round , Taylor landed a right uppercut that staggered M\u00e1rquez . A follow-up right hand put M\u00e1rquez down just before the bell rung to end the round . Soon after M\u00e1rquez arrived to his corner , his trainer told the referee to stop the fight , resulting in a technical knockout victory for Taylor . On December 4 , 2004 , Taylor fought former WBA Middleweight Champion William Joppy in his hometown of Little Rock . For the majority of the fight , Joppy made the more aggressive Taylor chase him , while landing few punches and seeming more content to frustrate Taylor . Taylor landed several punches early in the fight and knocked Joppy down in the fifth round en route to a unanimous decision victory with scores of 120 \u2013 107 from all three judges .

He tended to move forward , while Hopkins was patient and waited for openings in Taylor 's defense . In round five , a clash of heads opened a cut on the top of Taylor 's head . In the tenth round , Hopkins hurt Taylor with two right hands that made his legs wobble and forced him to clinch . Taylor won the bout by split decision with two judges scoring the fight 115 \u2013 113 for Taylor and the other judge scoring it 116 \u2013 112 for Hopkins .

An agreement was made 10 minutes before a purse bid was to take place . Ozell Nelson , unsatisfied with Taylor 's progression between the first and second Hopkins fights , helped convince Taylor to replace Pat Burns with hall of fame trainer Emanuel Steward . Taylor received $ 3.75 million for the fight and Wright made $ 3.5 million . Wright only paid sanctioning fees for the WBC belt , while Taylor paid fees to the WBC and WBO . Taylor did not pay the fees to the WBA amid controversy of the organization removing him from their rankings after questions of whether Taylor followed all procedures for the WBA before his rematch with Hopkins . He was reinstated at the top the organizations ' middleweight rankings , but his title remained under review . The bout was evenly competitive through the first 10 rounds , with Wright winning most of the early rounds before Taylor became more active in the latter part of the fight . By the ninth round , Wright had swelling above both his eyes . Wright was winning the bout going into the final round on two of the judges ' scorecards , but he was generally passive in the round . Two of the three judges gave the round to Taylor , which resulted in a draw . The scores for the fight were 115 \u2013 113 for Taylor , 115 \u2013 113 for Wright and 114 \u2013 114 . On December 9 , 2006 , Taylor fought Kassim Ouma at the Alltel Arena in North Little Rock , Arkansas . Taylor hurt Ouma early in the first round and continued to control the fight through the middle part of the fight with jabs and hooks . During the second half of the fight , Taylor gradually began to tire and suffered a cut over the left eye . He allowed Ouma to back him into the ropes often as the fight came to an end . However , Ouma was unable to be effective with his punches . Taylor won the bout by unanimous decision with scores of 117 \u2013 111 , 115 \u2013 113 and 118 \u2013 110 . Afterwards , the WBA announced that Taylor was no longer the holder of its Middleweight Super Championship . On May 19 , 2007 , Taylor went up against former Undisputed Welterweight Champion Cory Spinks at the FedEx Forum in Memphis . Taylor dictated the fight by staying away from Spinks and landing one punch at a time . He hurt Spinks with a right hand in the seventh round . Spinks , with a much shorter reach , had difficulty getting within a closer range against his opponent . Taylor landed 101 of 319 punches , while Spinks landed just 85 of 542 . Taylor won the fight by split decision , with two judges scoring 117 \u2013 111 and 115 \u2013 113 in favor of him and the other scoring 117 \u2013 111 for Spinks . = = = Fights with Pavlik = = = In his next bout , Taylor fought Kelly Pavlik on September 29 , 2007 at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City , New Jersey . Pavlik began rising in popularity after an upset victory over Edison Miranda in a Middleweight Title Eliminator to determine the number one contender to fight Taylor . During their amateur careers , Taylor had defeated Pavlik on February 9 , 2000 in the opening round of the United States Olympic trials . In the second round of the bout , Taylor landed a right hand and followed-up with several more punches which resulted in the first knockdown of the fight . Pavlik got up and managed to make it to the end of the round . Entering the seventh round , Taylor had a commanding lead on all three judges ' scorecards . With less than a minute remaining in the round , Pavlik landed a right cross that sent Taylor into a corner . Pavlik closed in and threw a left uppercut followed by a left and right hook and right uppercut . Two more left hooks dropped Taylor to the canvas as the referee stepped in to halt the fight . It was the first time Taylor had lost in his professional career and the first time he had ever been knocked down . One month later , Taylor exercised a rematch clause in his contract with Pavlik . The rematch took place at a weight of 166 pounds ( 75 kg ) , six pounds higher than the middleweight limit . Due to disappointing performances , Emanuel Steward was fired as Taylor 's trainer and replaced with Ozell Nelson . Fighting at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on February 16 , 2008 , Taylor lost the rematch to Pavlik by unanimous decision . = = = Super Middleweight = = = After the two losses to Pavlik , Taylor moved up to the super middleweight division . On November 15 , 2008 , Taylor defeated Jeff Lacy by a dominant unanimous decision to earn a mandatory fight against the winner of a bout between Carl Froch and Jean Pascal for the vacant WBC Super Middleweight title , a fight that was won by Froch . On April 25 , 2009 , at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard , Connecticut , Taylor fought Carl Froch for the WBC Super Middleweight title . Taylor was able to control the first two rounds of the fight . In the third round , Taylor knocked Froch down for the first time in his career with a right hand . Entering the final round , Taylor was ahead 106 \u2013 102 on two of the judges ' scorecards , while Froch was ahead 106 \u2013 102 on the other . During the round , Froch landed two right hands that sent Taylor to the canvas . He got up , but Froch quickly went after him , trapping him against the ropes and landing a barrage of hard and fast punches . Taylor could not recoup or defend himself , desperately curling up against the ropes . Around 10 clean hard shots from Froch landed before the referee stepped in to stop the bout with only a matter of seconds left in the final round , earning Froch the technical knockout victory . = = = Super Six and retirement = = = Taylor competed in the preliminary round of the Super Six World Boxing Classic , a tournament by Showtime , to find out who is the best boxer in the super middleweight division . On October 17 , 2009 , in his first fight in the Super Six tournament at the O2 World Arena in Berlin , Germany , undefeated Armenian-German former champion , Arthur Abraham , defeated Jermain Taylor by KO in the 12th round with less than 10 seconds left in the fight . Taylor was hospitalized with a severe concussion , suffering short term memory loss , unable to remember details of this bout . After being released from the hospital , Taylor released a statement saying that he 's doing just fine and wanted to congratulate Abraham on his victory and wish him well in the tournament . At the time of the stoppage , the judges scorecards read : 104-102 , 107-102 and 106-102 , all in favour of Abraham . In January 2010 , Taylor , one of the original members of the Super Six World Boxing Classic , officially withdrew from the tournament . The former Undisputed Middleweight Champion issued a statement in early 2010 saying , \" I 'm going to take some time off from the sport of boxing and take myself out of the SHOWTIME Sports World Boxing Classic tournament . It 's important that I give my body and mind some much needed rest , because I have been boxing for nearly 20 years , \" said Taylor . \" I plan on keeping myself in shape and making a return to the sport sometime in the future . This was not an easy decision for me , having discussed it with my family , trainer , friends and my adviser Al Haymon , because I 'm a very competitive person-but I know this is the smart road for me to take . \" Taylor was later replaced by Allan Green . = = = Comeback = = = On December 30 , 2011 , after 26 months away from the ring , Taylor finally returned and faced Jessie Nicklow .

He made short work of Mu\u00f1oz , winning via second-round KO . Taylor 's next bout was against Juan Carlos Candelo on December 14 , 2013 . Jermaine won with a seventh round TKO . On October 4 , 2014 , Taylor fought Sam Soliman , in Biloxi , Mississippi for Soliman 's IBF Middleweight World Championship belt . After twelve grueling rounds , ( Soliman injured his knee badly midway through the fight ) and knocking Soliman down four times ( Soliman actually went down on his own from the knee injury , not primarily from punches from Taylor ) , Taylor won with a resounding unanimous decision . By regaining the belt he had lost to Pavlik in 2007 , Taylor became a two-time middleweight world champion . On February 6 , 2015 Taylor was scheduled to defend his title against Sergio Mora on ESPN2 's Friday Night Fights in Biloxi , Mississippi . However , the fight was cancelled after Taylor suffered an injury and was also later arrested and charged with multiple felonies following an incident on January 19 ( see Personal life below ) . The IBF subsequently stripped him of his title on February 6 , due to his inability to defend during his ongoing legal and mental health issues . = = Personal life = = Taylor is married to former Louisiana Tech University basketball player Erica Taylor , who was selected in the second round of the 2005 WNBA Draft by the Washington Mystics .

Bergman went down twice in the first round , but recovered in the second round , knocking Judah down . Judah knocked out Bergman in the fourth round to win the title . On June 20 , 2000 , Judah made his first title defense against Junior Witter in Glasgow , Scotland . It was an awkward fight for Judah , as Witter rarely engaged in an extended exchange of punches . Witter frequently switched between fighting right-handed and left-handed , making him an elusive opponent . Judah 's consistent body punching slowed Witter down , and in the fifth round , Judah caught Witter with a straight left hand that hurt Witter and sent his mouthpiece skittering across the ring . Judah defeated Witter by unanimous decision . Two months later , on August 5 , 2000 , at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut , Judah defeated former IBF Light Welterweight Champion Terron Millett by fourth round knockout .

Tszyu went after Judah , throwing another right hand that landed on his chin and sent Judah crashing to the canvas . Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady , but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time . When Judah collapsed , Nady waved the fight over , resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah 's first professional loss . While Tszyu celebrated in his corner , Judah was in disbelief of what just happened and became infuriated . Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring . While being restrained by his father and trainer , Yoel Judah , he broke loose and walked up to Nady and stuck his gloved fist into his neck and had to be pulled off by cornermen . A few minutes later , Jimmy Lennon , Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen . Judah was fined $ 75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission . After defeating Omar Weis by unanimous decision in July 2002 , Judah challenged DeMarcus Corley for the WBO Light Welterweight title on July 12 , 2003 , at the Orleans Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .

Judah had trouble at the start figuring out how to fight Spinks , the taller fighter . He could not move forward to get inside , but was having success moving laterally . Spinks scored a knockdown in the eleventh round , but Judah came back and put Spinks down to the canvas in the final round . In the end , Spinks defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 114 \u2013 112 twice and 116 \u2013 111 . For the rest of 2004 , Judah defeated Rafael Pineda by split decision and Wayne Martell by first round technical knockout . On February 5 , 2005 , Judah would get a rematch with Spinks at the Savvis Center in St. Louis , Missouri , Spinks ' hometown . The fight was the first major bout in St. Louis in more than 40 years , and it was a sellout . Judah was the aggressor throughout the fight . He knocked Spinks down to his knees at the bell in the seventh round , but it was not ruled a knockdown . Spinks had a strong start to the ninth round and connected with a left hand , then followed with a right hand and a combination , but Judah scored a knockdown moments later . Judah pressed the attack after the first knockdown and avoided Spinks ' desperate efforts to tie him up . After Spinks was knocked down for the second time , the referee stopped the fight , and Judah became the new Undisputed Welterweight Champion . = = = = Undisputed Welterweight Champion = = = = In his first fight as undisputed welterweight champion , he fought Cosme Rivera on May 14 , 2005 , at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas . Judah sent Rivera down with a straight left hand to the face less than 30 seconds into the bout . Rivera beat the count , but was knocked down again about 10 seconds later . Judah hit Rivera hard several times in the second round , and in the third round , he connected with a left uppercut , that caused Rivera to stagger backwards and fall into the ropes before hitting the canvas . Rivera rose at the count of five , but he was badly hurt and the referee stopped the fight . His next fight took place on January 7 , 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir . For Judah , the fight was viewed as a tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather , Jr . , which was tentatively scheduled for April . Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir . The stage was set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead of touching gloves to show sportsmanship . The early rounds of the fight were close , but as the rounds passed , Judah was doing less than necessary to win , while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah . In round seven , Judah was hurt by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah 's head along the ropes during the tenth round . Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115 \u2013 113 , 114 \u2013 113 and 115 \u2013 112 from the three judges . The Ring named Baldomir 's victory over Judah the upset of the year for 2006 . Judah 's IBF and WBA belts were not on the line , because Baldomir did not pay sanctioning fees to the IBF and WBA . Baldomir did win The Ring and WBC titles , while the WBA ( Super ) title was vacated after Judah 's loss ( WBA ( Regular ) titleholder Luis Collazo became the sole WBA Champion ) , but the IBF still recognized him as their champion . = = = = Judah vs. Mayweather = = = = With the loss to Baldomir , it appeared that Judah 's much anticipated bout with Mayweather was off , but Judah 's promoter Don King and Mayweather 's promoter Bob Arum reworked the deals so the fight would go on . Mayweather was scheduled to earn a minimum $ 6 million while Judah was to earn $ 3 million plus a percentage of the profits , but because of Judah 's loss , Mayweather earned a minimum $ 5 million while Judah was guaranteed $ 1 million plus a percentage of profits above $ 7 million . The fight took place on April 8 , 2006 , at the Thomas and Mack Center in Las Vegas . Judah started strongly and put up a valiant fight , at times matching Mayweather 's speed and punching precision . It appeared that Judah scored a knockdown in the second round when Mayweather 's glove touched the canvas ; however , referee Richard Steele ruled it a slip . In round four , Judah landed a right hand to the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up . The momentum changed in the fifth round , when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face . Then Mayweather landed a right hand on the bridge of Judah 's nose , and blood began to flow . The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point . Once again , he drew blood from Judah 's nose . A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner , and Judah 's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight . With about 10 seconds left in the tenth round , Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and followed it with a right hand to the back of Mayweather 's head . As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain , Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period . Mayweather 's uncle and trainer , Roger Mayweather , climbed into the ring and approached Judah . Yoel Judah entered the ring and threw a punch at Roger . At that point , members of both fighters ' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued . More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation . After the ring was cleared , Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight . Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds on his way to a unanimous decision victory by scores of 116 \u2013 112 , 117 \u2013 113 and 119 \u2013 109 . After the fight , the purses for both fighters were withheld until video of the fight could be reviewed . Don King argued that Mayweather should have been disqualified because his uncle was the first person to enter the ring . At an April 13 hearing , the Nevada State Athletic Commission fined Roger Mayweather $ 200,000 and revoked his boxing license for one year . At a hearing on May 8 , the Commission disciplined the other offenders in the melee . It fined Yoel Judah $ 100,000 and revoked his license for one year , fined Mayweather cornerman Leonard Ellerbe $ 50,000 and suspended his license for four months , and fined Zab Judah $ 350,000 and revoked his license for one year . = = = = Return from Suspension = = = = On April 13 , 2007 , Judah made his return to the ring against Ruben Galvan at the Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel in Tunica , Mississippi . Judah came out strongly in the first round , landing numerous shots on Galvan . During the round , a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan 's head . The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor to take a look at the cut . Due to the severity of the cut , the fight was waved off . The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds , the fight was ruled a no contest . = = = = Judah vs. Cotto = = = = On June 9 , 2007 , Judah took on WBA Welterweight Champion Miguel Cotto in New York City before a soldout crowd at Madison Square Garden . In the first round , Cotto landed a low blow that put Judah to the canvas . Referee Arthur Mercante , Jr. offered a stern warning to Cotto . In the third round , Judah took yet another low blow from Cotto , which resulted in Cotto receiving a point deduction . Cotto and Judah delivered an all-action brawl , but after weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah 's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed , Cotto took over the bout . In round seven , both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times . In round nine , Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto 's aggressive style . By the tenth round , Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes , but Judah stayed upright . Early in the eleventh round , Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas . He managed to get to his feet , but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack , turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches . That forced the referee to stop the fight . Judah , who trailed 97 \u2013 91 on all three scorecards , claimed he had been weakened by the two low blows early in the fight . He said , \" The first low blow was very hard . The second one took a lot out of me . The low blows affected me from the time they hit me . \" Cotto earned $ 2.5 million plus a piece of the pay-per-view profits , while Judah earned $ 1 million plus a percentage of the profits .

In round nine , Judah suffered a cut over his right eye and the fight was stopped after he said he could not see . The referee had ruled the cut was caused by an accidental clash of heads and so the fight went to the scorecards .

The Brooklyn native began the busier fighter , using the jab and trying to land uppercuts for the first two rounds , while Matthysse worked on the body . In round three , a clash of heads opened a cut outside of the left eye of Judah . Matthysse displayed more aggression and became the aggressor in the third and the fourth round and Judah switched to a defensive tactic . In the next two rounds , the American boxer picked up the pace , beginning to land more combinations . The seventh round was less active but in the eight , Judah landed some hard right counter shots . Judah continued to box throughout the ninth round but Matthysse began to show more power in the tenth , focusing on the head of his opponent and knocking down the American boxer after a hard right hand to the jaw .

After a heated week of pre-fight confrontations , fans were expecting something special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah . And the fighters delivered , though in an unanticipated fashion . From early on it was clear that the bad blood would not adversely impact the fight , as both men fought strong technical fights . During the early rounds , Garcia steadily pulled ahead , outboxing Judah throughout . Judah was in serious trouble in rounds 5 and 6 , then finally went down in the 8th . From there , things took a surprising turn . Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late , Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch . Judah took the last 3 rounds , though his deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn 't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision ( 115-112 , 114-112 , 116-111 ) = = Professional boxing record = = = = Titles in boxing = = Major World Titles : Interim IBF Light Welterweight Champion ( 140 lbs ) IBF Light Welterweight Champion ( 140 lbs ) WBO Light Welterweight Champion ( 140 lbs ) WBC Welterweight Champion ( 147 lbs ) WBA ( Super ) Welterweight Champion ( 147 lbs ) IBF Welterweight Champion ( 147 lbs ) ( 2 ) IBF Light Welterweight Champion ( 140 lbs ) Minor World Titles : International Boxing Council Light Middleweight Champion ( 154 lbs ) The Ring / Lineal Championship Titles : The Ring Welterweight Champion ( 147 lbs ) Regional / International Titles : Interim USBA Light Welterweight Champion ( 140 lbs ) WBO Inter-Continental Welterweight Champion ( 147 lbs ) WBO NABO Welterweight Champion ( 147 lbs ) = = Personal life = = Judah has nine brothers and two sisters .

He was also known as Count Combat or Conde Koma in Spanish and Portuguese , a nickname he picked up in Spain in 1908 . Along with Ant\u00f4nio Soshihiro Satake ( another naturalized Brazilian ) , he pioneered judo in Brazil , the United Kingdom , and other countries . Maeda was fundamental to the development of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu , including through his teaching of Carlos Gracie and others of the Gracie family . He was also a promoter of Japanese emigration to Brazil . Maeda won more than 2,000 professional fights in his career . His accomplishments led to him being called the \" toughest man who ever lived \" and being referred to as the father of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu . = = Biography = = Maeda was born in Funazawa Village , Hirosaki City , Aomori Prefecture , Japan , on November 18 , 1878 . He attended Kenritsu Itiu high school ( currently Hirokou \u2014 a Hirosaki school ) . As a child , he was known as Hideyo . He practiced sumo as a teenager , but lacked the ideal build for the sport . Because of the interest generated by stories about the success of judo at contests between judo and jujutsu that were occurring at the time , he changed from sumo to judo . In 1894 , at seventeen years of age , his parents sent him to Tokyo to enroll in Waseda University . He took up Kodokan judo the following year . = = = Formative years at the Kodokan = = = Arriving in the Kodokan , Maeda , who was 164 cm tall and weighed 64 kg , was confused with a delivery boy due to his country manners and demeanor . He was spotted by judo 's founder Kano Jigoro , and assigned to Tsunejiro Tomita ( 4th dan at the time ) , the smallest of the teachers of the Kodokan 's shiten-no , to illustrate that in judo size is not important . Tomita was the first Kodokan judoka and a close friend of Kano . According to Koyasu Masao ( 9th dan ) : Although the weakest of Kodokan shiten-no , Tomita was able to defeat the great jujutsu champion of that time , Hansuke Nakamura , from the Tenjin Shin 'y\u014d-ry\u016b style . With Soishiro Satake , Maeda formed the head of the second generation of Kodokan judoka , which had replaced the first by the beginning of the 20th century . Satake , at 175 cm and 80 kg , was unmatched in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself was not able to match Maeda in judo . Satake would later travel to South America with Maeda and settle in Manaus , Amazonas State , while Maeda continued traveling . Satake would become the founder , in 1914 , of the first historically registered judo academy in Brazil . He and Maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in Brazil . At that time , there were few graduated Kodokan judoka . Maeda and Satake were the top graduated professors at Waseda University , both sandan ( 3rd dan ) , along with Matsuhiro Ritaro ( nidan or 2nd dan ) and six other shodan ( 1st dan ) . Kyuzo Mifune registered at the Kodokan in 1903 and attracted the attention of Maeda , who commented , \" you are strong and competent , therefore , you will certainly leave your mark in the Kodokan ... \" Mifune went to learn under Sakujiro Yokoyama and later , already a celebrated judoka , Mifune said that Maeda 's words were a great incentive , as he regarded Maeda with the greatest admiration , even though Yokoyama was his sensei ( instructor ) . According to Mifune , in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi , after defeating three adversaries in succession , but in a following tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries in a row and was awarded the rank of 4th dan ( yondan ) . Mifune also states that Maeda was one of the most vigorous promoters of judo , although not by teaching the art , instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from other disciplines . Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike , throwing them as if in real combat . He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students , but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters , who would abandon him in favor of other professors . = = = Prelude to Kodokan 's expansion = = = In 1879 , Ulysses S. Grant , the former President of the United States , visited Japan . While in Tokyo , he attended a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi 's home in Asukayama . Kano Jigoro was one of the jujutsuka present . At that time , jujutsu was just starting to become known in Europe and the Americas . Excepting literal circus acts , few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing or learning about the art . Even in Japan , judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time . Indeed , it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan , and outside Japan , judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s . In 1903 , a senior Kodokan instructor named Yamashita Yoshiaki traveled to the United States at the request of the Seattle businessman Sam Hill . In Washington , DC , Yamashita 's students included Theodore Roosevelt and other prominent Americans . At Roosevelt 's request , Yamashita also taught judo at the US Naval Academy . Capitalizing on the publicity , the Japanese Legation in the USA asked the Kodokan to send more judo teachers to America , providing continuity to Yamashita 's work . Tomita reluctantly accepted the task ; Maeda and Satake embraced the opportunity . = = = Career = = = = = = = United States = = = = Tomita , Maeda , and Satake sailed from Yokohama on November 16 , 1904 , and arrived in New York City on December 8 , 1904 . Early in 1905 , Tomita and Maeda gave several public demonstrations of judo . On February 17 , 1905 , Tomita and Maeda gave a demonstration at Princeton University , when Maeda threw N. B. Tooker , a Princeton football player , while Tomita threw Samuel Feagles , the Princeton gymnasium instructor . On February 21 , 1905 , they gave a judo demonstration at the United States Military Academy at West Point , where Tomita and Maeda performed kata ( patterns ) \u2014 nage-no , koshiki , ju-no , and so on . At the request of the crowd , Maeda wrestled a cadet and threw him easily . Because Tomita had been the thrower in the kata , the cadets wanted to wrestle him too . Tomita threw the first ( Charles Daly ) without any trouble . However , Tomita twice failed to throw another football player named Tipton using tomoe-nage ( stomach throw ) . Afterwards , the New York sportswriters claimed the victory for the cadets because Tomita was thrown , whereas the Japanese embassy staff proclaimed that Tomita had achieved a moral victory , on the grounds that he was a far smaller man . A conflicting account provided by the New York Times on February 21 , referring to Tomita as \" Prof. Tomet , \" states that In any event , later that year the US Military Academy hired a former world champion professional wrestler , Tom Jenkins , instead of a judo teacher , a job Jenkins kept until his retirement in 1942 . The Japanese experts did better at the New York Athletic Club on March 8 , 1905 : \" Their best throw was a sort of flying cartwheel , \" said an article in the New York Times , describing Maeda 's match with John Naething , a 200 lb wrestler . \" Because of the difference in methods the two men rolled about the mat like schoolboys in a rough-and-tumble fight . After fifteen minutes of wrestling , Maeda secured the first fall . Ultimately , however , Naething was awarded the match by pin fall . \" On March 21 , 1905 , Tomita and Maeda gave a \" jiu-do \" demonstration at Columbia University attended by about 200 people . Following introductions , Tomita demonstrated falls and throws , then Maeda threw the university 's wrestling instructor . According to the student newspaper , \" Another interesting feature was the exhibition of some of the obsolete jiu jitsu tricks for defense with a fan against an opponent armed with the curved Japanese sword . \" Translations were provided by chemist Takamine Jokichi . During April 1905 , Tomita and Maeda started a judo club in a commercial space at 1947 Broadway in New York . Members of this club included Japanese expatriates , plus a European American woman named Wilma Berger . On July 6 , 1905 , Tomita and Maeda gave a judo exhibition at the YMCA in Newport , Rhode Island . On September 30 , 1905 , they gave a demonstration at another YMCA , in Lockport , New York . In Lockport , the local opponent was Mason Shimer , who wrestled Tomita unsuccessfully . On November 6 , 1905 , Maeda was reported visiting professional wrestler Akitaro Ono in Asheville , North Carolina ; after this , Maeda was no longer routinely associated with Tomita in the US newspapers . On December 18 , 1905 , Maeda was in Atlanta , Georgia , for a professional wrestling match with Sam Marburger . The contest was best of three , two falls with jackets and one without , and Maeda won the two with jackets and lost the one without . According to the Atlanta papers , Maeda listed his residence as the YMCA in Selma , Alabama . Maeda was fond of the name and started using it to promote his art thereafter . = = = = Cuba , Mexico , and Central America = = = = During November 1908 , Maeda went to Paris , France , apparently to see his friend Akitaro Ono . From Paris , he went to Havana , arriving there on December 14 , 1908 , and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular . On July 23 , 1909 , Maeda left Havana for Mexico City . His debut in Mexico City took place at the Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14 , 1909 . This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets . Shortly afterwards , Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater . His standing offer was 100 pesos ( US $ 50 ) to anyone he could not throw , and 500 pesos ( US $ 250 ) to anyone who could throw him . The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money . During September 1909 , a Japanese calling himself ' Nobu Taka ' arrived in Mexico City for the purpose of challenging Maeda for what the Mexican Herald said would be the world jujutsu championship . After several months of public wrangling , Taka and Maeda met at the Colon Theater on November 16 , 1909 ; Taka won . There was an immediate rematch , and four days later , Maeda was pronounced the champion . It was later revealed that Taka was , in fact , Maeda 's old friend , Soishiro Satake . In January 1910 , Maeda took part in a wrestling tournament in Mexico City . During the semifinals , Maeda drew with Hjalmar Lundin . This is a different result than Lundin recalled in his 1937 memoirs . Said Lundin , \" Having been accustomed to handling the big Greco-Roman wrestlers with ease , the Jap thought he could do likewise with me , but in the first encounter I got the better of him , after which my confidence returned . I had no trouble then in winning the match . It was a surprise to the crowd and a set-back for Koma . He had been the hero all week , but as soon as he was beaten the fans , true to form , called him a bum . \" In July 1910 , Maeda returned to Cuba , where he tried to arrange matches with Frank Gotch and Jack Johnson . The Americans ignored him \u2014 there was no money to be made wrestling him , and much money to be lost if they lost to him . On August 23 , 1910 , Maeda wrestled Jack Connell in Havana ; the result was a draw . During 1911 , Maeda and Satake were joined in Cuba by Akitaro Ono and Tokugoro Ito . The four men were known as the ' Four Kings of Cuba.' The Four Kings were very popular in Cuba , and the Japanese media were proud of the reputation they were bringing to judo and Japan . Consequently , on January 8 , 1912 , the Kodokan promoted Maeda to 5th dan . There was some resistance to this decision because there were those in Japan who did not approve of his involvement in professional wrestling . In 1913 , Tokugoro Ito stayed in Cuba while Maeda and Satake went to El Salvador , Costa Rica , Honduras , Panama , Colombia , Ecuador and Peru . In El Salvador , the president was assassinated while Maeda was there , and in Panama , the Americans tried to pay him to lose ; in response , they kept moving south . In Peru they met Laku , a Japanese jujutsuka who taught the military , and invited him to join them . They were then joined by Okura in Chile , and by Shimitsu in Argentina . The troupe arrived in Brazil on November 14 , 1914 . = = = = Brazil = = = = According to a copy of Maeda 's passport provided by Gotta Tsutsumi , head of Bel\u00e9m 's Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Paramaz\u00f4nica Nipako , Maeda arrived in Porto Alegre on November 14 , 1914 , where his first exhibition in Brazil took place . After appearing in Porto Alegre , Maeda and his companions moved throughout the country : on August 26 , 1915 , Maeda , Satake , Okura , Shimitsu , and Laku were at Recife ; during October 1915 , they were in Bel\u00e9m , finally arriving in Manaus on December 18 , 1915 . Tokugoro Ito arrived some time later . On December 20 , 1915 , the first demonstration in Bel\u00e9m took place at the Theatro Politheama . The O Tempo newspaper announced the event , stating that Conde Koma would show the main jiu-jitsu techniques , excepting the prohibited ones . He would also demonstrate self-defense techniques . After that , the troupe would be accepting challenges from the crowd , and there would be the first sensational match of jiu-jitsu between Shimitsu ( champion of Argentina ) and Laku ( Peruvian military professor ) . On December 22 , 1915 , according to O Tempo , jiu-jitsu world champion Maeda , head of the Japanese troupe , and Satake , New York champion , performed an enthusiastic and sensational jiu-jitsu match . On the same day , Nagib Assef , an Australian Greco-Roman wrestling champion of Turkish origin , challenged Maeda . On December 24 , 1915 , Maeda defeated in seconds the boxer Barbadiano Adolpho Corbiniano , who became one of his disciples . On January 3 , 1916 at Theatro Politheama , Maeda finally fought Nagib Assef , who was thrown off the stage and pinned into submission by arm-lock . On January 8 , 1916 , Maeda , Okura , and Shimitsu boarded the SS Antony and left for Liverpool . Tokugoro Ito went to Los Angeles . Satake and Laku stayed in Manaus teaching , according to O Tempo , jiu-jitsu . After 15 years together , Maeda and Satake had finally split up . Of this last trip , little is known . Maeda went from England to Portugal , Spain , and France , coming back to Brazil in 1917 alone . Settling in Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1 , Maeda married D. May Iris . Maeda was still popular in Brazil , and recognized as a great fighter , although he only fought sporadically after his return . Around 1918 \u2013 1919 , Maeda accepted a challenge from the famous capoeirista P\u00e9 de Bola . Maeda allowed P\u00e9 de Bola to use a knife in the fight . The capoeirista was 190 cm tall and weighed 100 kg . Maeda won the match quickly . In 1921 , Maeda founded his first judo academy in Brazil . It was called Clube Remo , and its building was a 4 m x 4 m shed . Later , it was moved to the Fire Brigade headquarters and then to the church of N. S. de Aparecida . In 1991 , the Academy was located in the SESI and was run by Alfredo Mendes Coimbra , of the third generation of Conde Koma 's descendants . On September 18 , 1921 , Maeda , Satake , and Okura were briefly in New York City . They were aboard the Booth Line steamship SS Polycarp . All three men listed their occupations as professors of \" juitso \" . After leaving New York , the three men went to the Caribbean , where they stayed from September to December 1921 . At some point in this trip , Maeda was joined by his wife . In Havana , Satake and Maeda took part in some contests . Their opponents included Paul Alvarez , who wrestled as Espanol Icognito . Alvarez defeated Satake and Yako Okura \u2014 the latter being billed as a former instructor at the Chilean Naval Academy \u2014 before being himself beaten by Maeda . Maeda also defeated a Cuban boxer called Jose Ibarra , and a French wrestler called Fournier . The Havana papers attributed Maeda with a Cuban student called Conde Chenard . = = = Later years = = = In 1925 , Maeda became involved with helping settle Japanese immigrants near Tome-a\u00e7\u00fa , a Japanese-owned company town in Par\u00e1 , Brazil . This was part of a large tract in the Amazon forest set aside for Japanese settlement by the Brazilian government . The crops grown by the Japanese were not popular with the Brazilians , and the Japanese investors eventually gave up on the project . Maeda also continued teaching judo , now mostly to the children of Japanese immigrants . Consequently , in 1929 , the Kodokan promoted him to 6th dan , and on November 27 , 1941 , to 7th dan . Maeda never knew of this final promotion , because he died in Bel\u00e9m on November 28 , 1941 . The cause of death was kidney disease . In May 1956 , a memorial to Maeda was erected in Hirosaki City , Japan . The dedication ceremony was attended by Risei Kano and Kaichiro Samura . = = Influence on the creation of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu = = Gast\u00e3o Gracie was a business partner of the American Circus in Bel\u00e9m . In 1916 , Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda . In 1917 , Carlos Gracie \u2014 14 \u2011 year-old son of Gast\u00e3o Gracie \u2014 watched a demonstration by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided to learn judo ( also known at the time as ' Kano Jiu-Jitsu ' ) . Maeda accepted Gracie and Luiz Fran\u00e7a as students [ 1 ] , and the youth went on to become a great exponent of the art and ultimately , with his younger brother H\u00e9lio Gracie , founded Gracie Jiu-Jitsu , modern Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu . In 1921 , Gast\u00e3o Gracie and his family moved to Rio de Janeiro . Carlos , then 17 years old , passed Maeda 's teachings on to his brothers Osvaldo , Gast\u00e3o , and Jorge . H\u00e9lio is considered by many as the founder of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ( though others , such as Carlson Gracie , have pointed to Carlos as the founder ) . = = Maeda 's philosophy of combat = = According to Renzo Gracie 's book Mastering Jujitsu , Maeda not only taught the art of judo to Carlos Gracie , but also taught a particular philosophy about the nature of combat based on his travels competing and training alongside catch-wrestlers , boxers , savate fighters , and various other martial artists . The book details Maeda 's theory that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases , such as the striking phase , the grappling phase , the ground phase , and so on . Thus , it was a smart fighter 's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat that best suited his own strengths . The book further states that this theory was a fundamental influence on the Gracie approach to combat . The approach included armed versus armed , armed versus unarmed , unarmed , standing ( tachiwaza , \u7acb\u3061\u6280 ) , kneeling ( suwariwaza , \u5ea7\u6280 ) , and ground work ( newaza , \u5bdd\u6280 ) , close quarters ( hakuheijugi , \u767d\u5175\u4e3b\u7fa9 ) , and other forms of combat . It was employed by other proponents of judo ( ' Kano jiu-jutsu ' ) who , like Maeda , engaged in challenge match fighting overseas as judo spread internationally ( e.g. , Yukio Tani in the United Kingdom from 1905 , Mikonosuke Kawaishi in France , and others ) .",

                    "text": "Australian cricket team in England in 1948 = The Australian cricket team in England in 1948 was captained by Don Bradman , who was making his fourth and final tour of England . The team is famous for being the first Test match side to play an entire tour of England without losing a match . This feat earned them the nickname of The Invincibles , and they are regarded as one of the greatest cricket teams of all time . According to the Australian federal government the team \" is one of Australia 's most cherished sporting legends \" . Including five Test matches , Australia played a total of 31 first-class fixtures , plus three other games , two of the non-first-class matches being played in Scotland . They had a busy schedule , with 112 days of play scheduled in 144 days , meaning that they often played every day of the week except Sunday . Their record in the first-class games was 23 won and 8 drawn ; in all matches , they won 25 and drew 9 ; many of the victories were by large margins . They won the Test series 4 \u2013 0 with one draw . The strength of the Australian team was based around its formidable batting line-up , which included Bradman , Arthur Morris , vice-captain Lindsay Hassett , Neil Harvey and Sid Barnes , and the hostile fast bowling of Ray Lindwall , Keith Miller and Bill Johnston . Due to the popularity of Bradman , generally regarded as the greatest batsman of all time , and the fact that he had announced that it was his farewell international tour , the Australians were greeted with much fanfare across the country , and many records for match attendances were broken . The record for Test attendance at a match in England was broken three times , in the Second , Third and Fourth Tests , and stands to this day . = = Touring party = = = = Significance = = The 1948 Australian team has great significance in cricket history as it is the only side to tour England unbeaten , earning the sobriquet The Invincibles . The tour was captain Donald Bradman 's last Test series , and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in . It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians . Even so , various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians as one of the best cricket teams ever , and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team , Warwick Armstrong 's Australian side of just after World War I , the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s . This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton , Bradman 's batting rival from the 1930s , who wrote ' the 1948 Australian side to England , side that some critics , ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season , dubbed the \" best Australian team ever \" \u2013 which was just moonshine . Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948 ' , but his view is very much in the minority . The high regard with which The Invincibles are held in the annals of Australian and world cricket is reflected in the various honours accorded to the players . Bradman , Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 . Hassett , Morris and Harvey were later inducted , so that 20 % of the inductees are from the 1948 team . Of these six , all except Hassett were selected in Australia 's Team of the Century , with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy . Bradman , Lindwall , Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council 's Hall of Fame . In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians . Graveney strongly disagreed with the result , writing ' there has not been a better team in my lifetime than Don Bradman 's Australian tourists of 1948 ' . The computer regarded Sam Loxton as a member of the team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey , if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team . = = Preparations = = Since the resumption of cricket following World War II , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and their captain Donald Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . The committee that selected the touring party was Bradman , Jack Ryder and Chappie Dwyer . They held their final meeting on Wednesday 11 February and announced the team that day . The team was chosen with a dual emphasis on strong batting and fast bowling . This was in large part because England had agreed to make a new ball available after 55 six-ball overs in the Tests ; a new ball was generally taken after every 200 runs , which usually takes more than 55 overs to accumulate , the rule change meant that a new ball was more frequently available . A new ball is more helpful to fast bowling , so this move favoured the team with the better pace attack , in this case Australia . Australia had injury concerns to key players ahead of the tour . Chronic knee injuries had begun to hamper medium-pacer Toshack , and he only made the trip after a 3 \u2013 2 vote by a medical panel , despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit . Leading paceman Lindwall had been playing with an injured leg tendon . In addition , his foot drag during the delivery stride led to speculation about the legality of his bowling action . The injury was worked on ahead of the tour , while Bradman advised Lindwall on how to rectify any suspicion over his bowling action . The Australian captain advised his bowler to ensure that his foot was further behind the line than usual to avoid being no-balled , and to operate below full speed until the umpires were satisfied . Bradman 's counsel was effective , as Lindwall did not have a no-ball problem during the tour . Bill Jeanes , who was secretary of the Australian Board of Control and had managed the previous Australian tour of England in 1938 , was offered the job of managing the 1948 team , but turned it down . Jeanes had become increasingly unpopular among the players because of an approach that cricket historian Gideon Haigh has called \" increasingly officious and liverish \" . He was replaced by Keith Johnson , the New South Wales delegate to the Australian Board of Control . Johnson had previously managed the Australian Services team \u2014 which included Keith Miller and Lindsay Hassett \u2014 in the Victory Tests that took place in 1945 at the conclusion of the Second World War in Europe . = = = Warm-up matches in Australia = = = Before they sailed for England , Australia played three warm-up matches . The first two were two-day games against Tasmania in Hobart and at the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground , Launceston ; the third was a three-day match against Western Australia in Perth . In Hobart , Australia scored 538 / 5 declared with centuries by Barnes , Hassett and Harvey in reply to 122 . Using a mixture of pace and spin , they reduced Tasmania to 186 / 7 when time ran out . In Launceston , Australia won by an innings and 49 runs . Toshack took 5 / 24 as Tasmania fell for 123 . Australia then scored 288 before five bowlers shared the wickets as Tasmania fell for just 116 , Barnes taking 3 / 1 . Four days later , on Saturday 13 March , the Australians were at the WACA Ground where they found a tougher test from Western Australia . Western Australia scored 348 as Wally Langdon made 112 , while five bowlers took two wickets each . Australia replied with 442 / 7 declared , including 115 apiece by Morris and Bradman . Western Australia only had time to reach 62 / 3 and the game was drawn . The match attracted a total crowd of 30,500 . = = Voyage and stopover in Ceylon = = The team set sail on board RMS Strathaird from Fremantle on Friday 19 March . En route to England , the Australians berthed in Colombo where they played a one-day single-innings match \u2014 not limited overs \u2014 against the Ceylon national team at the Colombo Cricket Club Ground . The local newspaper The Islander ran a headline of \" Bradman Will Definitely Play \" and this guaranteed a crowd of more than 20,000 . Australia batted first and became suspicious about the pitch as the morning went on . At lunch , Ian Johnson demanded that the pitch be measured and it was found to be only 20 yards ( 18 m ) long . After that , the bowlers delivered from two yards behind the crease . Australia made 184 / 8 declared ( Barnes 49 , Miller 46 ) before a monsoon ended the match with Ceylon at 46 / 2 in reply . The party docked at Tilbury on Friday 16 April to a resounding welcome . Bradman announced the delivery of 17,000 food parcels as a gift to the British people from the State of Victoria . Great Britain was still in the throes of rationing and post-war austerity . = = Popularity = = Despite Australia 's ruthless on-field dominance and a succession of one-sided victories , the touring team drew unprecedented levels of spectator and media interest . Bradman 's dominant cricketing stature was a key factor in his team 's popularity with the public , especially as it was known that it would be his last international campaign . A leading cricket writer of the time , R. C. Robertson-Glasgow , said \" we want him to do well . We feel we have a share in him . He is more than Australian . He is a world batsman . \" The Australian journalist Andy Flanagan said that \" cities , towns and hotels are beflagged , carpets set down , and dignitaries wait to extend an official welcome . He is the Prince of Cricketers . \" Writing later , Haigh opined that \" perhaps no touring cricketer ... has been as feted as Bradman in that northern summer \" . Bradman received hundreds of personal letters every day , and one of his dinner speeches was broadcast live , causing the British Broadcasting Corporation to postpone the news bulletin . Of Bradman 's retirement , Robertson-Glasgow said in the 1949 Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack : \" ... a miracle has been removed from among us ... So must ancient Italy have felt when she heard of the death of Hannibal . \" As a team , the Australians were greeted by record crowds and gate receipts across the country , even when wet weather curtailed the matches . The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times , in the Second Test at Lord 's , the Third Test at Old Trafford , and the Fourth Test at Headingley . The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil . Off the field , the Australians were inundated with requests for social functions , including appointments with government officials and members of the royal family , and they had to juggle a plethora of off-field engagements , with 112 days of scheduled cricket in the space of 144 days . Three-day matches were often held consecutively with only the traditional Sunday rest day , although their dominance ended several matches prematurely and earned them extra rest days . Team manager Keith Johnson , the only administrator in the touring party , was flooded with phone calls and letters . Bradman later said he was worried that Johnson 's tireless work would cause health problems and that \" it was the tribute to a bulldog determination to see the job through \" . Wisden said \" Indebtedness for the smooth running of the tour and general harmony of the team was due largely to the manager , Mr Keith Johnson , hard-working and always genial ... Paying tribute to the loyalty of the players , Mr Johnson said there had not been a discordant note in the party throughout the tour . \" Bradman said that \" no side could have wished for a better manager \" . = = Bradman 's role = = Bradman 's position as a selector gave him more power than previous Australian captains , who did not have an explicit vote in team selection . This was further magnified by Bradman being a member of the Board of Control while still an active player , a threefold combination that he alone has occupied in Australian cricket history . According to Haigh , he \" was the dominant figure in Australian cricket \" , and an \" unimpeachable figure \" . At the age of 40 , Bradman was by four years the oldest player on the team ; three quarters of his team were 32 or younger , and some viewed him as a father figure . Bradman wrote that this was the most personally fulfilling period of his playing days , as the divisiveness of the 1930s had passed . He wrote : Knowing the personnel , I was confident that here at last was the great opportunity which I had longed for . A team of cricketers whose respect and loyalty were unquestioned , who would regard me in a fatherly sense and listen to my advice , follow my guidance and not question my handling of affairs ... there are no longer any fears that they will query the wisdom of what you do . The result is a sense of freedom to give full reign to your own creative ability and personal judgment . However , some players expressed displeasure at Bradman 's ruthless obsession towards annihilating the opposition . Miller deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball for a duck in a protest against Australia 's world record of 721 runs in one day against Essex . He also deplored Bradman 's hard-nosed attitude in fixtures nominally designated as \" festival matches \" . Feeling that Bradman was needlessly batting Australia far beyond impregnability , Miller played with reckless aggression , rather than a measured style in line with his captain 's aim of remaining undefeated . Bradman 's letters in later life , published posthumously , revealed his hostility towards Miller . Sid Barnes later criticised Bradman for his reluctance to allow Ron Hamence \u2014 one of the reserve batsmen \u2014 to partake in meaningful matchplay due to captain 's reluctance to risk Australia 's unbeaten run . = = Roles and strategy = = As matches often started the day after the previous fixture , sometimes amounting to six days of cricket a week \u2014 Sunday was always a rest day \u2014 Australia employed a rotation policy in order to allow the players to recuperate , except for the Tests and matches against Worcestershire , the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Leveson-Gower 's XI , when they chose their strongest team . As a result , no member of the squad \u2014 Bradman included \u2014 played in more than 23 of the first-class matches . Thus , the vice-captain Hassett led the Australians in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested , and maintained the unbeaten run in all of them . Wisden opined that \" in addition to his playing ability Hassett 's cheerfulness and leadership , which extended to off-the-field relaxation as well as in the more exacting part of the programme , combined to make him an ideal vice-captain able to lift a considerable load off Bradman 's busy shoulders \" . Likewise , the batting was regularly rotated . The three openers Barnes , Morris and Brown took turns sitting out , while the middle-order was changed frequently and the wicket-keeping duties divided between Tallon and Saggers . Australia 's bowling attack was led by Lindwall and Miller , who took the new ball in the Tests . Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball . English cricket administrators had agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs ; at the time , the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored , something that usually took longer than 55 overs . The new regulation played directly into the hands of the Australians , as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack . Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs . As a result , Australia 's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs , and the left arm seamer Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign . The new ball rule also meant that spin bowling was less effective in the Tests , so Australia only used one full-time spinner in the Tests , off spinner Johnson , until his omission in favour of leg spinner Ring . Together they took only eight wickets . Things were different in the county matches . As Bradman wanted to keep Lindwall and Miller fresh for the Tests , he generally gave them a lighter workload against the weaker opposition in the county matches , and the three spinners Ring , Johnson and McCool did more of the work , especially as the 55-over rule did not apply outside the Tests . Ring did the second-most bowling outside the Tests , despite not being in Bradman 's first-choice team . Bradman even used Hamence , a reserve batsman , to open the bowling at times , in order to rest his bowlers , and in the second match against Yorkshire , decided to bat for an extended period instead of going for a win , so that his bowlers could recuperate . = = Ashes Test matches = = The five-Test Ashes series was won convincingly by Australia 4 \u2013 0 . England was captained by Norman Yardley and their batting was strong on paper , the first four in the order generally being Len Hutton , Cyril Washbrook , Bill Edrich and Denis Compton . They were supported by the likes of Joe Hardstaff junior , Tom Dollery , Charlie Barnett , Jack Crapp , John Dewes , Allan Watkins , Yardley and wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans . However , they found the fast bowling trio of Lindwall , Miller and Johnston \u2014 supported by the medium pace of Toshack \u2014 a real handful , especially with the 55-over new ball rule . Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers , with high pace and the ability to deliver menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the batsmen . Prior to World War II , pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body . England were yet to develop similar bowlers , and as a result , Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation . At one stage , the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton , something that provoked great controversy . Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece , at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively , while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15 . For England , the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton , who scored 562 runs at 62.44 . Washbrook ( 356 runs at 50.85 ) was the only other player to average beyond 45 . In contrast , Australia 's batsmen had relatively little difficulty against the hosts ' attack . England 's bowling was largely reliant on Alec Bedser and against a powerful Australian batting line-up he managed only 18 wickets at 38.22 . Alec Coxon , Dick Pollard , Edrich , Barnett and Yardley provided his seam support . Jim Laker , Jack Young , Eric Hollies and Doug Wright were the spinners in action . Bedser was the only English bowler to take more than nine wickets . Morris led the runscoring and century-making with 696 runs at 87.00 and three triple-figure scores , supported by Bradman ( 508 at 72.57 ) and Barnes ( 329 at 82.25 ) . With the first three batsmen in such form , Australia regularly made strong starts to their innings , averaging more than 120 for their first two wickets . The resounding Australian victories gave the England selectors many problems as they sought to find a combination that could challenge the tourists ' superiority . As a result , England used 21 players in all , while Australia only used 15 , one of which was forced by injury . Australia had ten players who competed in four or more Tests , while England only had seven such players . = = = First Test = = = Since the Second World War , Australia had played 11 Tests and had been unbeaten . In 1946 \u2013 47 , they won the five-Test series against England 3 \u2013 0 , and followed this with a 4 \u2013 0 series win over India in the following season . Australia were regarded as an extremely strong team in the lead-up to the tour of England , and Bradman publicly expressed his desire to achieve the unprecedented feat of going through the five-month tour without defeat . Prior to the First Test , Australia had played 12 first-class matches , winning ten and drawing two . Eight of the victories were by an innings , and another was by eight wickets . It was thought that Bradman would play Ring , but he changed his mind on the first morning of the First Test when rain was forecast . Johnston was played in the hope of exploiting a wet wicket and he amply rewarded his captain by taking the most wickets of any bowler in the match . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The first innings set the pattern of the series as the England top-order struggled against Australia 's pace attack . Only twenty minutes of play was possible before the lunch break due to inclement weather , but it was enough for Miller to bowl Hutton . During the interval , heavy rain made the ball skid through upon resumption . Washbrook was caught attempting to hook Lindwall . At 15 / 2 , Compton came in , and together with Edrich , they took the score to 46 before left arm paceman Johnston bowled the latter . Two balls later , Johnston removed Hardstaff without scoring , leaving England at 46 / 4 . Two runs later , Compton was bowled by Miller and half the English team were out with only 48 runs on the board . Lindwall was forced to leave the field mid-innings due to a groin injury and did not bowl again . Johnston bowled Barnett and when Evans and Yardley were both dismissed with the score on 74 , England only had two wickets left . Laker and Bedser scored more than half of England 's total , adding 89 runs in only 73 minutes . Both fell within two runs , ending England 's innings at 165 . Laker top-scored with 63 . Johnston ended with 5 / 36 , a display characterised with accuracy and variations in pace and swing . Miller took 3 / 38 and a catch . Australia 's openers Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss after 15 minutes . Ideal batting conditions greeted the players on the second day . Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Laker removed Morris . Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 before Barnes was caught by wicket-keeper Evans with a one-handed diving effort for 62 . Miller was then dismissed for a duck by Laker . Australia scored slowly , as Yardley employed leg theory to slow the scoring . Brown came in at No. 5 , but he had played most of his career as an opening batsman and appeared uncomfortable before falling for 24 . Hassett came in and Australia reached stumps at 293 / 4 , a lead of 128 . Bradman reached his 28th Test century in over 210 minutes , with the last 29 runs taking 70 minutes . It was one of his slower innings as Yardley focused on stopping runs . On the third morning , Bradman added only eight before falling for 138 when he leg glanced an inswinger from Bedser to Hutton at short fine leg . Johnson and Tallon came and went , failing to pass 21 . The scoring was slow during this passage of play \u2014 Young delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs . Lindwall came out to bat at 365 / 7 and he added 107 runs with Hassett for the eighth wicket . Hassett reached his century and proceeded to 137 in almost six hours of batting . Both fell in quick succession , but Australia 's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes before Bedser ended the innings on 509 , leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead . Yardley placed the majority of the bowling load on his spinners , with Young ( 1 / 79 ) and Laker ( 4 / 138 ) bowling 60 and 55 overs respectively . Bedser bowled 44.2 overs , taking 3 / 113 . At the start of England 's second innings , Washbrook and Edrich fell early , leaving England at 39 / 2 . This brought together England 's leading batsmen , Hutton and Compton , who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day . Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon , delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day . One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm . The batsmen survived , but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd . The English had the better of the late afternoon period , scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes . Hutton resumed on 63 and he and Compton progressed before the light deteriorated and a thunderstorm stopped proceedings . Shortly after the resumption , Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions , ending a 111-run partnership at 150 / 3 . The innings was then repeatedly interrupted by poor light . Wisden opined that \" rarely can a Test Match have been played under such appalling conditions as on this day \" . Hardstaff supported Compton in a partnership of 93 before being removed by Toshack , and Barnett followed soon after at 264 / 5 . Compton brought up his third consecutive century at Trent Bridge , aided by a 57-run partnership with his captain before Johnston dismissed Yardley for 22 . England reached stumps at 345 / 6 , just one run ahead , with Compton on 154 . Compton and Evans continued to resist the Australians on the final morning , which was briefly interrupted twice by rain . After the resumption , Compton was out hit wicket for 184 after attempting to hook Miller . He had batted for 413 minutes and hit 19 fours . Wisden opined that \" No praise could be too high for the manner in which Compton carried the side 's responsibilities and defied a first-class attack in such trying circumstances \" . Compton 's fall at 405 / 7 exposed the bowlers and Australia quickly finished off the innings within half an hour . England finished at 441 , leaving Australia a target of 98 . Lindwall 's absence meant that the remaining four frontline bowlers had to bowl more than 32 overs each \u2014 Johnston bowled 59 and ended with 4 / 147 while Miller took 4 / 125 from 44 overs . Australia progressed steadily to 38 before Bedser bowled Morris for nine and then dismissed Bradman for a duck , again caught by Hutton at short fine leg . This left Australia 48 / 2 . Hassett joined Barnes and they reached the target without further loss . Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries . = = = Second Test = = = Australia retained the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge . On the other hand , England made three changes ; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced the left arm orthodox of Young , all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5.batsman . Following his injury in the previous Test , Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman , who gambled on his inclusion . Australia won the toss and elected to bat . Miller played , but was unfit to bowl . Barnes fell for a duck , and Morris and Bradman rebuilt the innings , slowly taking the score to 87 before Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time by Hutton in the leg trap off Bedser . In the meantime , Morris , after a slow start , made 105 runs out of a total of 166 scored while he was at the wicket , including 14 fours and one six . His innings was noted for powerful , well-placed cover drives . His dismissal left Australia at 166 / 3 , quickly followed by Miller , left Australia at 173 / 4 . Hassett and Brown rebuilt the innings slowly , taking more than three and half minutes on average for each run . Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley removed him and Brown in the space of nine runs to leave Australia 225 / 6 . Johnson fell soon after and England were well placed when Australia ended the day on 258 / 7 . Australia 's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning . Tallon batted on , supported by Johnston and Toshack , who scored their highest Test scores . Australia 's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston \u2014 who scored 29 . Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston fell . Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers , ending with 4 / 100 from 43 overs , while debutant Coxon took 2 / 90 from 35 overs . Lindwall took the new ball and felt pain in his groin again after delivering his first ball . He persevered through the pain and removed Washbrook in his fourth over . Hutton then fell to Johnson to leave England at 32 / 2 . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich before doing the same to Dollery for a duck two balls later . England were 46 / 4 and Australia were firmly in control . Compton was joined by his skipper Yardley and the pair rebuilt the innings , scoring 87 runs together in 100 minutes . After the tea break , Lindwall and Johnston returned with the new ball . Compton edged Johnston to be out for 53 . One run later , Lindwall bowled Yardley to leave England at 134 / 6 with their skipper dismissed for 44 . Johnson then removed Evans for nine , before Coxon and Laker added 41 for the eighth wicket . After 85 minutes of resistance , Johnston removed both . England 's last pair added ten runs to close at stumps on 9 / 207 . On the third morning , Lindwall removed Bedser , ending England 's innings at 215 , giving Australia a 135 first innings lead . Lindwall ended with 5 / 70 . The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings . Barnes was given an early life and he took advantage to combine with Morris in an opening stand of 122 before Morris was bowled for 62 . Bradman joined Barnes at the crease and they amassed 174 runs for the second wicket . Barnes accelerated after reaching his half-century . Once he reached his century , Barnes became particularly aggressive . He dispatched one Laker over for 21 runs , including two successive sixes before finally falling for 141 , caught on the boundary from Yardley . He had struck 14 boundaries and two sixes in his innings . The speed of his batting had allowed Australia to be 296 / 2 after 277 minutes when he departed . Hassett was bowled first ball , so Miller came to the crease at 296 / 3 to face Yardley 's hat-trick ball . Miller survived a loud leg before wicket appeal on the hat-trick ball . Bradman fell to Bedser again , this time for 89 . Brown joined Miller at 329 / 4 and Australia reached stumps at 343 , without further loss . After the rest day , the fourth morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages . In 88 minutes of play , Australia added a further 117 runs . Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run partnership with Miller , who was out for 74 , followed by Lindwall for 25 . Bradman declared with Australia at 460 / 7 , 595 runs ahead . Yardley and Laker had been the only multiple wicket-takers , with two each . Further showers breathed extra life into the pitch , and Lindwall and Johnston extracted steep bounce with the new ball , troubling the English batsmen . Hutton was dropped before he had scored and played and missed multiple times . Hutton and Washbrook took the score to 42 , before Hutton edged Lindwall and was out for 13 . Toshack removed Edrich and Washbrook in quick succession to leave England at 65 / 3 . However , Compton and Dollery added 41 to have England close at 106 / 3 . The final day started poorly for England , with Compton being caught off Johnston from the second ball of the day . Yardley and Dollery took the score to 133 before Toshack took two wickets in the same over . Eight runs later , Dollery was bowled from a Lindwall bouncer that stayed low . Lindwall bowled Laker for a duck later in the same over to leave England at 141 / 8 . England were bowled out for 186 , ceding a 409-run victory . Toshack ended the innings with 5 / 40 , while Lindwall and Johnston took three and two respectively . The gross attendance was 132,000 and receipts were \u00a3 43,000 \u2014 a record for a Test in England . = = = Third Test = = = When the teams reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test , Hutton had been dropped . The reason was said to be Hutton 's struggles with Lindwall 's short-pitched bowling . The omission generated considerable controversy. and the Australians were pleased , feeling that Hutton was England 's best batsman . Hutton 's opening position was taken by debutant Emmett . England made three further changes . Young and Pollard replaced Wright and Laker in the bowling department . Coxon was replaced by debutant batsman Jack Crapp . Australia dropped Brown , who had scored 73 runs at 24.33 in three innings , for the all rounder Loxton . Yardley won the toss and elected to bat . The change in England 's opening pair did not result in better results . A run out was narrowly avoided from the first ball , and Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that helped the bowlers . Both fell early , leaving England 28 / 2 . Edrich eschewed attacking strokeplay as he and Compton attempted to establish themselves . Compton attempted to hook a Lindwall bouncer , but edged it into his face . This forced him to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive batting , resulting in one 25-minute period where only one run was added . They reached lunch at 57 / 2 . Upon the resumption , Crapp accelerated , hitting a six and three boundaries from Johnson . Australia took the new ball and Lindwall trapped Crapp lbw for 37 . Dollery then fell for one . England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97 / 4 . After 170 minutes of slow batting , Edrich fell to Lindwall . At 119 / 5 , Compton returned to the field , his wound having been stitched . Yardley fell for 22 with the score at 141 / 6 , bringing Evans to the crease . Compton and Evans added 75 runs , before Lindwall removed the latter to leave England at 216 / 7 . England resumed on the second day at 231 / 7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball . Bedser defied the Australians for 145 minutes , adding 37 and featuring in a 121-run partnership with Compton . Soon after , Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes , who was standing at short leg , forcing him into hospital . The last two wickets fell and England were bowled out for 363 . Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting , having struck 16 fours . Lindwall took 4 / 99 and Johnston 3 / 67 . Barnes 's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener . Johnson was deployed as Australia 's makeshift second opener , but made only one , and Bradman fell for seven to leave Australia at 13 / 2 . Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings , adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before Hassett fell . Miller joined Morris and they took the score to 126 / 3 at stumps . Australia had added only nine runs on the third morning when Miller fell for 31 . Four runs later , Morris fell for 51 , leaving Australia 139 / 5 . Barnes came in , despite having collapsed in the nets due to the lingering effects of the blow to his chest . He made a painful single before the pain forced him back to hospital . Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before Tallon fell . Lindwall came into bat at 172 / 6 with Australia facing the prospect of the follow on . Loxton and Lindwall added a further 36 before the former was bowled , leaving Australia 208 / 7 , five runs behind the follow-on mark . Johnston helped Lindwall advance Australia beyond the follow on before Bedser removed both and Australia were bowled out for 221 , giving England a lead of 142 runs . During his innings , Lindwall was given a series of bouncers by Edrich . One of the short-pitched balls hit Lindwall in the hand , evoking cheers from the crowd . Bedser and Pollard were the most successful bowlers , taking 4 / 81 and 3 / 53 respectively . Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at the start of the second innings , bringing his tormentor Edrich to the crease . Lindwall did not bounce Edrich , but Miller did , earning the ire of the crowd . Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes . This was aided three dropped catches from Washbrook . Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six , but was immediately run out by Morris with a direct hit . Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball , as England reached 174 / 3 at the close , with Washbrook unbeaten on 85 . The rest day was followed by the fourth day , which was abandoned due to persistent rain . Yardley declared at the start of the fifth day , leaving Australia a victory target of 317 , but the rain meant that the entire first session was lost . The tourists batted in a defensive manner to ensure a draw . They ended at 92 / 1 in 61 overs . Morris finished unbeaten on 54 , his fourth consecutive half-century of the Test series . The attendance of 133,740 exceeded the previous Test . = = = Fourth Test = = = Australia made two changes for the Test . Harvey replaced the injured Barnes , while Saggers replaced the injured Tallon behind the stumps . England made three changes . Emmett was dropped and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position . Laker replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young . Dollery , who had made only 38 in three innings , was replaced by all-rounder Cranston . England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch . Hutton and Washbrook put on an opening partnership of 168 , the best by England in the series . Washbrook refrained from the hook shot , which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series . The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall . Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich , the pair batted until late in the first day , when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day . His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs . Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268 / 2 , with Edrich on 41 . The next day , Bedser batted on in steady support of Edrich . The pair saw England to lunch without further loss , and 155 runs were added for the third wicket before Bedser was out after almost three hours of batting for 79 . Bedser had struck eight fours and two sixes . Edrich fell three runs later at 426 / 4 for 111 . With two new batsmen at the crease , Australia quickly made further inroads to leave England at 473 / 6 . Loxton then successively removed Cranston , Evans and Laker as England fell from 486 / 6 to 496 / 9 , before Miller bowled Yardley to end England 's innings at 496 . The home team had lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 73 runs . Loxton took 3 / 55 while Lindwall and Johnson both took two . Australia lost the services of Toshack after he broke down with a knee injury . With Barnes injured , Hassett was moved from the middle order to open the innings with Morris . Morris fell for six , before Bradman and Hassett saw the tourists to stumps at 63 / 1 . Bradman did the majority of the scoring , finishing unbeaten on 31 . On the third morning , England made the ideal start when Pollard removed Hassett for 13 and Bradman for 33 in the same over . This left Australia struggling at 68 / 3 . Harvey , playing his first Ashes Test , joined Miller at the crease . Australia were more than 400 behind and Harvey told his senior partner \" Let 's get stuck into ' em \" . If England were to remove the pair , they would expose Australia 's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to win by taking a substantial lead . The pair launched a counterattack , with Miller taking the lead with many lofted boundaries . This allowed Australia to seize the initiative , with Harvey joining in and hitting consecutive boundaries against Laker . Miller was dismissed by Yardley for 58 while attempting another six , but the partnership had yielded 121 runs in 90 minutes , prompting Wisden to liken it to a \" hurricane \" . Harvey then shared another century stand with Loxton which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes . Harvey ended with a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 112 from 183 balls in an innings noted for powerful driving on both sides of the wicket . The high rate of scoring during the innings freed the match from England 's firm control . Loxton was particularly severe on Laker , lifting his deliveries into the crowd for five sixes in addition to nine fours . At the other end , Harvey and Johnson fell to Laker in quick succession to leave the score at 329 / 6 . Australia was still some way behind when Lindwall replaced Johnson , and 15 runs later , Yardley bowled Loxton for 93 , while Saggers only managed five , leaving Australia at 355 / 8 with only Johnston and Toshack remaining . Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He was the last man out at 458 , leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings . Bedser took the final wicket to end with 3 / 92 . Laker took 3 / 113 , while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each . England set about extending their first innings lead for the remainder of the fourth day . For the second time in the match , Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership . Washbrook made 65 and Hutton 57 , leaving England at 129 / 2 . Edrich and Compton continued where the openers had left off , adding 103 before Lindwall trapped Edrich lbw for 54 . England lost wickets at regular intervals late in the day to be 278 / 6 . When Johnston removed Compton for 66 , England were 7 / 293 with no recognised batsmen remaining , having lost 4 / 33 . Wicket-keeper Evans led a rearguard action as England reached 362 / 8 at the close of the fourth day . England batted on for five minutes on the final morning , adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 365 / 8 , with Evans on 47 not out . Johnston had the pick of the bowling figures , with 4 / 95 . Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a heavy roller , which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin . This left Australia a target of 404 runs for victory . At the time , this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side . Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target , and the local press wrote them off , predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers . Morris and Hassett started slowly on a pitch that offered spin and bounce . Only 44 runs came in the first hour . Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed by Compton 's left arm unorthodox spin for 17 with the score at 57 . Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes and they began to attack ; Morris hit three consecutive fours off Len Hutton 's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 121 / 1 . In the half hour preceding the interval , Australia had added 64 runs . Both had given chances , but England fumbled them . Upon resumption , Morris severely attacked Compton , who had been bowling in an attempt to exploit the spin , aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs . This prompted Yardley to take the new ball . Australia reached 202 , halfway to the required total , with 165 minutes left . Morris passed his century , and was then dropped on 126 . Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity . Australia reached tea at 288 / 1 with Morris on 150 . The pair had added 167 during the session . Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182 , having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes . He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting . This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required . He fell with eight runs still needed . Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs . Australia had won by seven wickets , setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase , with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours . The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds . The attendance remains a record for a Test in England . = = = Fifth Test = = = With the series already lost , England made four changes to their team . Dewes replaced the injured Washbrook , while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder . Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut . England played two spinners ; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker , while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard 's pace . The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes . Australia made three changes . Off spinner Johnson was replaced by the leg spin of Ring . Australia 's second change was forced on them ; the injured seamer Toshack was replaced by the recovered batsman Barnes . The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury . The match saw Lindwall at his best . English skipper Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch . Precipitation during the week meant that the start of the Test was delayed until the afternoon . The humid conditions , along with the rain , assisted the bowlers , with Lindwall in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights . Miller bowled Dewes for one with his second ball to leave England at 2 / 1 , before Johnston removed Edrich for three to leave England at 10 / 2 . Lindwall dismissed Compton after Morris had taken a diving catch , and Miller then removed Crapp , who failed to score in his 23-ball innings , leaving England at 23 / 4 . After the lunch break , England had struggled to 35 / 4 , before Lindwall bowled Yardley with a swinging yorker . The debutant Watkins then batted for 16 balls without scoring before Johnston dismissed him for a duck to leave England at 42 / 6 . Watkins also collected a bruise on the shoulder that inhibited his bowling later in the match . Lindwall then removed Evans , Bedser and Young , all yorked in the space of two runs . The innings ended at 52 when Hutton leg glanced and was caught by wicket-keeper Tallon , who grasped the ball one-handed at full stretch to his left . In his post-lunch spell , Lindwall bowled 8.1 overs , taking five wickets for eight runs , finishing with 6 / 20 in 16.1 overs . Bradman described the spell as \" the most devastating and one of the fastest I ever saw in Test cricket \" . Hutton was the only batsman to resist , scoring 30 in 124 minutes from 147 deliveries . No other player passed seven . Miller and Johnston took 2 / 5 and 2 / 20 respectively , and Ring was not needed to bowl . In contrast , Australia batted with apparent ease , and Morris and Barnes passed England 's first innings total by themselves . The score had reached 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61 , ending a partnership that had taken only 126 minutes . This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day . As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level , the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once . The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat . Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers . With 6996 Test career runs , he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket , but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly . Hassett came in at 117 / 2 and Australia closed at 153 / 2 . Morris was unbeaten on 77 . On the second morning , Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand ended with Hassett 's fall for 37 . The following four batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease and none passed 20 . Morris was finally removed for 196 , ending an innings noted for his hooking and off-driving ; it took a run out to remove Morris . Australia were eventually out for 389 . Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the leg spin of Hollies , who took 5 / 131 . England had relied heavily on spin ; two thirds of the overs were delivered by the two spinners . England started their second innings 337 runs in arrears . Lindwall made the early breakthrough , and Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the innings to close at the end of the second day on 54 / 1 . Early on the third day , Lindwall bowled Edrich for 28 , before Compton and Hutton consolidated the innings with a partnership of 61 in 110 minutes . On 39 , Compton fell to a reflex catch by Lindwall . Hutton managed to continue resisting before edging Miller to Tallon for 64 , having top-scored in both innings , to leave England at 153 / 4 . Thereafter , England collapsed in the fading light , . prompting the umpires to call off play . The ground was then hit by rain , resulting in a premature end to the day 's play . England had lost four wickets for 25 runs to end at 178 / 7 . England resumed on the fourth morning and Johnston quickly removed the last three wickets to seal an Australian victory by an innings and 149 runs . Johnston ended with 4 / 40 and Lindwall 3 / 50 . This result sealed the series 4 \u2013 0 in favour of Australia . The match was followed by a series of congratulatory speeches . = = Other matches in Great Britain = = = = = v Worcestershire = = = At Worcester , 28 , 29 , 30 April . Worcestershire ( 233 and 212 ) lost to the Australians ( 462 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 17 runs . The pitch was slow , and the weather was cold and showery for the traditional tour opener against Worcestershire . Worcester attracted a record attendance of 32,000 with takings of more than \u20a4 4000 . The hosts elected to bat , and started strongly as a century second-wicket stand took them to 137 / 1 after 133 minutes . However , the dismissal of Charles Palmer , who top-scored with 85 , precipitated a collapse and they lost their last nine wickets in two hours to be all out for 233 . Five Australian bowlers shared the wickets , with Johnson taking 3 / 52 . In their sole innings , Australia took the initiative from the outset through a 166-run second-wicket stand between Morris ( 138 ) and Bradman ( 107 ) . This took them to 265 / 1 , before they declared at 462 / 8 after Miller had hit an unbeaten 50 in faster than even time . Off spinner Peter Jackson took 6 / 135 for the locals . In their second innings Worcestershire were bowled out by Australia for 212 runs , with 70 minutes to spare . McCool took 4 / 29 as the spinners took eight of the wickets . = = = v Leicestershire = = = At Leicester , 1 , 3 , 4 May . The Australians ( 448 ) defeated Leicestershire ( 130 and 147 ) by an innings and 171 runs . Australia elected to bat , and Miller , who had been promoted to No. 3 , shared century partnerships with Barnes ( 78 ) and Bradman ( 81 ) . A middle-order collapse then ensued as the remaining Australians struggled against the local spin attack , but last man Johnston managed to hold up his end in a 37-run last-wicket partnership that allowed Miller to reach his double century . He ended on 202 not out as Australia were dismissed for 448 . The Australian-born slow bowler Vic Jackson was the best Leicestershire bowler , taking 5 / 91 . Leicestershire scored only 130 in their first innings ; another Australian expatriate , Jack Walsh , top-scored with 33 . Ring took 5 / 34 and the hosts hampered their batting efforts with two run outs . Australia enforced the follow on and Leicestershire faced the prospect of being bowled out twice in a day after Johnson took the first wickets to have them 5 / 83 . After a rain delay Australia took the final five wickets for 34 runs in an hour on the final day ; Leicestershire were all out for 147 in an innings defeat . Johnson ended with 7 / 42 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Bradford , 5 , 6 May . Yorkshire ( 71 and 89 ) lost to the Australians ( 101 and 63 / 6 ) by four wickets . This low-scoring game was the closest that Australia came to defeat on the tour . The game was played in cold , blustery , overcast and wet conditions that suited spin bowlers . Yorkshire made only 71 in their first innings . Miller mixed medium-paced off-breaks with his fast bowling and this combination returned him 6 / 42 . At the other end Johnston bowled his left arm orthodox spin and took 4 / 22 from 26 overs . Together the pair bowled almost unchanged , delivering 49.3 of 54.3 overs . Australia struggled in reply and stumps were called when they fell to 4 / 38 . Miller came in at the start of the second day 's play and scored 34 of the next 48 runs added , before falling at 7 / 86 , part of a collapse of 5 / 27 . He hit two sixes in his innings , including one from the first ball that he faced , feeling that a defensive strategy would be almost impossible in the difficult conditions . Australia ended at 101 , and Loxton was unable to bat due to injury . Frank Smailes had the best bowling figures for Yorkshire , 6 / 51 . Yorkshire scored 89 in their second innings , which followed a similar pattern to their first effort . Wickets fell steadily as Johnston ( 6 / 18 ) and Miller ( 3 / 49 ) bowled 31.2 of the 36.2 overs . Australia were set a target of 60 runs for victory , and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled . Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett \" might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because whenever there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [ erratic bounce and sideways movement ] out of the pitch \" . Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down . Australia slumped to 6 / 31 , effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury , but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease . Harvey was given two chances , once when he was on one , and Tallon was also missed . It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912 , but Harvey won the game with a straight drive over the fence . Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece , and at the rate of every four overs . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 8 , 10 , 11 May . The Australians ( 632 ) defeated Surrey ( 141 and 195 ) by an innings and 296 runs . Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for the opening stand before the latter fell for 65 . Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket . Barnes ' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes . After Bradman departed at 403 / 3 , wickets began to fall more regularly , but Hassett held up his end and made 110 , while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50 . Surrey 's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4 / 104 . On the second afternoon , Surrey scored 141 runs in three hours in their first innings . Johnson took 5 / 53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out , but received little support , the next highest scores being 15 and 10 . Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day . They made continual inroads on the final day , and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win . Johnston took 4 / 40 and Johnson 3 / 40 . = = = v Cambridge University = = = At Fenner 's , Cambridge , 12 , 13 , 14 May . Cambridge University ( 167 and 196 ) lost to the Australians ( 414 / 4 declared ) by an innings and 51 runs . Cambridge elected to bat and wickets fell regularly . No player made over 33 and the hosts were out in the second session of the first day for 167 . Miller was prominent with the ball and in the field , taking 5 / 46 and two catches for his fellow bowlers . In reply , Australia were already 184 / 1 at stumps , with Brown heading for a consecutive century . He put on 176 for the second wicket with Hamence , who made 92 . Brown reached 200 and was out immediately thereafter , prompting stand-in skipper Hassett to declare midway through the second day at 414 / 4 , having reached 61 not out himself . In their second innings Cambridge failed to cope with the leg-spin of McCool , who took 7 / 78 as the match ended early on the third morning . Attendance over the three days was nearly 25,000 . = = = v Essex = = = At Southend , 15 , 17 May . The Australians ( 721 ) defeated Essex ( 83 and 187 ) by an innings and 451 runs . After electing to bat , Australia made history on the first day by breaking the record for the most runs scored in a first-class match in a day . Ironically , it was the only time they were dismissed in a single day on the entire tour . With centuries from Brown ( 153 ) , Bradman ( 187 ) , Loxton ( 120 ) and Saggers ( 104 * ) , Australia 's first innings totalled 721 ; they were dismissed on the close of the first day 's play . Bradman 's 187 came in 155 minutes and Brown 's 153 lasted three hours ; the pair put on 219 in 90 minutes after Barnes fell for 79 at 145 / 1 . Bradman came in and seized the initiative , reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch , including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore . Bradman and Brown were parted when the latter fell at 364 / 2 only halfway through the day 's play . Miller then famously deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball as a protest against Australia 's merciless crushing of their hosts , something that angered his captain and batting partner Bradman . Miller later told Dickie Bird that he had wanted to go to the local horse races , but this was refused by Bradman . The all rounder therefore made his duck in protest , but still did not get to go to the races . Later , Loxton and Saggers made 166 in 65 minutes for the sixth wicket , before an late-order collapse saw Australia lose 5 / 57 , leaving Saggers unbeaten , but not before he reached the only first-class century of his career . After being demoralised by the Australian batsmen on the first day , Essex made only 83 in their first innings , capitulating within 37 overs . Toshack took 5 / 31 and Miller 3 / 14 , and Australia enforced the follow-on . Essex 's second innings appeared to be heading the same way when four early wickets to Johnson had them at 46 / 6 . However , a partnership of 133 between Tom Pearce and Peter Smith for the seventh wicket salvaged some respectability before they were out for 187 . Johnson ended with 6 / 37 as the Australians dismissed their hosts twice in a single day . The ground attendance of 32,000 was a record . = = = v Oxford University = = = At Oxford , 19 , 20 , 21 May . The Australians ( 431 ) defeated Oxford University ( 185 and 156 ) by an innings and 90 runs . Australia batted first after Hassett won the toss , and the opening pair of Brown and Morris put on 139 . Brown scored his third century in succession , before being out lbw to Indian Test player Abdul Hafeez Kardar for 108 . Morris , Loxton , McCool and Ring all reached 50 as the Australians posted 431 . Oxford 's best batting performance came in the form of a 75-run partnership between Geoffrey Keighley and Kardar in their first innings , resisting the spin bowlers on the dry wicket . Despite Kardar 's innings of 54 and 29 , the top-score in both innings , Australia won by an innings and 90 runs as wickets fell steadily . The wickets were spread evenly among the tourists ; Toshack took three in each innings , while Johnston and McCool totalled four for the match . = = = v Marylebone Cricket Club = = = At Lord 's , 22 , 24 , 25 May . The Australians ( 552 ) defeated Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) ( 189 and 205 ) by an innings and 158 runs . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and with two other capped players , were basically a full strength Test team , as were Australia , who fielded their first-choice team . Barring one change in the bowling department , the same team lined up for Australia in the First Test , with the top six batsmen in the same position . It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage . After winning the toss , Australia batted first . After the loss of Morris early , Barnes ( 81 ) and Bradman ( 98 ) set about regaining the ascendancy with a 160-run stand . Bradman scored eleven fours in his 98 , which took two hours , and Hassett then took over and added 51 . Miller then saw Australia to stumps at 407 / 5 . He continued the next day and Australia 's highest scorer with 163 , and Johnson supported him with 80 . Despite a collapse which saw the last five wickets fall for 54 runs following the pair 's departure , Australia reached 552 . Bradman 's batsmen gained a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests by attacking the off spin of Jim Laker . They hit nine sixes from the English Test representative on the second morning . Miller and Lindwall then sought to gain an advantage over England 's leading batsmen \u2014 Hutton and Compton \u2014 before the Tests . The MCC side , composed almost entirely of Test players , reached 91 / 2 , Toshack removed Compton and Hutton in quick succession to reduce the hosts to 104 / 5 . He took three more wickets to end with 6 / 51 as the MCC were eventually dismissed for 189 , conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs . Some English observers decried Toshack 's leg stump attack as being negative , but former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack 's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played . Bradman opted to enforce the follow on , and his spinners did most of the damage , McCool taking 4 / 35 and Johnson 3 / 37 . Only Len Hutton of the locals batsmen passed 26 during the match , scoring 52 and 64 , and Australia had taken a key psychological victory ahead of the Tests with an innings victory . The total attendance was 60,000 . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Manchester , 26 , 27 , 28 May . The Australians ( 204 and 259 / 4 ) drew with Lancashire ( 182 ) . The first day was abandoned due to rain . Australia lost the toss and were sent in to bat on a drying pitch . The 19-year-old Lancashire spin bowler Malcolm Hilton took Bradman 's wicket twice in the match , causing a media sensation . Hilton bowled Bradman with an arm ball for 11 , the Australian captain 's first score on tour below 80 . The Australian batsmen failed to capitalise on their starts as six were dismissed between 20 and 40 . Australia looked set to concede a lead for the first time on tour as the hosts reached 3 / 129 , but Johnston ( 5 / 49 ) took five of the last seven wickets for 28 runs in Lancashire 's only innings , which ended on the third morning . With a result impossible , Australia had time for batting practice . Bradman reached 43 , and when Hilton came on , the Australian captain , perhaps perturbed by earlier events , attempted to hit the spinner out of the attack . After missing the first two balls , Bradman charged the third , swung and missed , fell over and was stumped . Harvey ( 76 * ) and Hamence ( 49 * ) shared an unbeaten fifth-wicket partnership of 122 after Loxton made 52 . = = = v Nottinghamshire = = = At Nottingham , 29 , 31 May 1 June . Nottinghamshire ( 179 and 299 / 8 ) drew with the Australians ( 400 ) . In Nottinghamshire 's first innings , Ray Lindwall took 6 / 14 from 15.1 overs , with only 10 scoring strokes being made off him . Reg Simpson made 74 and Joe Hardstaff junior 48 , but only one other batsman reached double figures . After their 98-run third-wicket stand was broken , Australia took 8 / 68 to bowl the hosts out for 179 . Lindwall , conceded less than a run per over . Only ten of his balls were scored from and not a single run was taken from his last 30 balls . Fingleton said that Lindwall \" absolutely paralysed \" the batsmen , with some of his bowling \" in the real Larwood manner \" . Australia only batted once , and Brown top-scored with 122 in 3 hours 45 minutes , while Bradman added 86 . The Australia middle-order fell away and the tourists lost their last six wickets for 74 runs . In the county 's second innings , Keeton was hit in the chest by one of Lindwall 's deliveries and took no further part in the match . On the final day , Hardstaff hit the first century against the Australians on the tour , 107 , and Simpson again batted well , making 70 . Lindwall and the Australian pacemen were less incisive in the second innings , and Ring and Johnson took four and three wickets respectively . = = = v Hampshire = = = At Southampton , 2 , 3 , 4 June . Hampshire ( 195 and 103 ) lost to the Australians ( 117 and 182 / 2 ) by eight wickets . Hampshire won the toss and elected to bat against the Australians , who were led by Hassett while Bradman rested . The Australians were behind on the first innings for the first time on the tour and the match remained in the balance until the third afternoon . On a drying pitch , the hosts reached 116 / 3 before losing their remaining wickets for 79 to be all out for 195 , while Johnston took 6 / 74 . In reply , Australia fared worse and collapsed from 2 / 70 and made only 117 . Charles Knott 's off spin proved challenging for the Australians , but Miller scored three successive sixes from him before the collapse , top-scoring with 39 . In their second innings , both Miller and Johnston took five Hampshire wickets . John Arnold top-scored for the hosts in both innings , with 48 and 42 . Australia needed 182 runs in 175 minutes to win . Barnes went for a duck but Johnson , sent in five minutes before lunch , hit 74 out of a second-wicket partnership of 105 , including three sixes and seven fours . Brown , with 81 not out , and Hassett saw the Australians through to victory . = = = v Sussex = = = At Hove , 5 , 7 June . Sussex ( 86 and 138 ) lost to the Australians ( 549 / 5 declared ) by an innings and 325 runs . Lindwall won the match for the Australians with his bowling , taking 11 / 59 . After winning the toss , the Sussex batsmen struggled with his length and variation of pace , and he hit the off-stump five times in the first innings alone to end with 6 / 34 . Loxton also bowled well in the first innings , taking 3 / 13 . Australia replied to Sussex 's 86 strongly , and were already 254 / 1 by the end of the first day . Powered by Morris 's 184 and with centuries too for Bradman ( 109 ) and Harvey ( 100 * ) , Australia added a further 295 runs on the second day to declare at 549 / 5 . They then still had time to send down 63.3 overs , enough to finish the match within two days . In Sussex 's second innings Lindwall took two wickets in the first over . Harry Parks made 61 , but Sussex were all out for 138 , losing their last seven wickets for 59 . In all , eight of Lindwall 's wickets were bowled , five these by swinging yorkers , the batsmen unable to counter the swerving deliveries . Fingleton said that \" Lindwall bundled the stumps over in all directions \" as Sussex \" crumpled completely ... in as depressing a batting performance as the tour knew \" . At the other end , Toshack helped to pin down the batsmen for Lindwall . He delivered 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs . = = = v Northamptonshire = = = At Northampton , 16 , 17 , 18 June . Northamptonshire ( 119 and 169 ) lost to the Australians ( 352 / 8 declared ) by an innings and 64 runs . Starting the day after the First Test , the Northamptonshire match was interrupted by rain . Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7 / 61 before some tail-end resistance took them to 119 ; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each . The Australians passed the locals ' score on the first afternoon , and their innings was built around Hassett 's 127 , which included 17 fours . Morris and McCool also made fifties . Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings , Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each . In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50 . = = = v Yorkshire = = = At Sheffield , 19 , 21 , 22 June . The Australians ( 249 and 285 / 5 declared ) drew with Yorkshire ( 206 and 85 / 4 ) . The Australians were made to work hard for their 249 , with only Bradman reaching 50 . Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores . Alec Coxon took 4 / 66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test . Yorkshire made 206 in reply , Toshack taking 7 / 81 and Johnston 3 / 101 : together , they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings . Like the Australians , the local batsmen struggled to make the most of their starts ; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40 . Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test , Bradman declared Australia 's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining . Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86 , putting on 154 for the second wicket . Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings . The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no urgency to force a result . Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw . The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators . = = = v Surrey = = = At The Oval , 30 June , 1 \u2013 2 July . Surrey ( 221 and 289 ) lost to The Australians ( 389 and 122 / 0 ) by 10 wickets . Australia won the toss and sent Surrey in to bat . They made 221 , and Jack Parker top-scored with 76 in an uneven effort in which there were six single-figure scores . As the match started the day after the Second Test , Bradman let most of his second-string bowlers do the work to rest his first-choice bowlers , and Ring took three wickets , while the Test players only took two in total . Hamence opened the batting for Australia \u2014 Brown injured a finger while fielding \u2014 but he was out for a duck . Hassett ( 139 ) and Bradman ( 128 ) then put on 231 , Bradman making his sixth century of the tour . However , the Australians lost wickets steadily thereafter to be all out for 389 . Surrey made 289 in their second innings , with McCool taking 6 / 113 after bowling more than 40 % of the overs . The hosts batted steadily with three fifties , but wickets fell regularly and only one partnership greater than 40 materialised . The tourists wanted to finish the run-chase quickly so they could watch fellow Australian John Bromwich play in the Wimbledon tennis final . Harvey and Loxton volunteered and chased down the 122 runs needed for victory in just 58 minutes to complete a 10-wicket win in just 20.1 overs . Harvey ended unbeaten on 73 and the Australians arrived at Wimbledon in time . = = = v Gloucestershire = = = At Bristol , 3 , 5 , 6 July . The Australians ( 774 / 7 declared ) defeated Gloucestershire ( 279 and 132 ) by an innings and 363 runs . The Australians elected to bat and made the highest score of the tour , and it was also the second biggest score by an Australian team in England ( the 1893 team made 843 against a \" Oxford and Cambridge Universities Past and Present \" at Portsmouth ) , and the highest score by an Australian team versus an English county . Morris 's 290 , made from 466 balls in five hours , was the highest individual score of the tour , and he featured in century stands with Barnes , Miller and Harvey . Loxton made 159 not out , Harvey 95 and McCool 76 . This match preceded the Third Test , and off spinner Tom Goddard was regarded as a candidate for England selection after strong performances in county cricket . However , Morris and Loxton 's aggressive attack gave Goddard figures of 0 / 186 from 32 overs , effectively ending his chances of selection . Former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said \" Tom [ Goddard ] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [ shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking ] to him and that gets him many wickets . \" Instead , it was Loxton who forced his way into the Third Test . Gloucestershire replied with an innings of 279 , in which Jack Crapp made 100 not out , while Johnson took 6 / 68 . Made to follow on during the final day , the hosts made only 132 , losing their last eight wickets for 60 . Johnson took 5 / 32 to end with 11 / 100 for the match , while Ring took 5 / 47 to end with seven for the match . Australia 's spinners took 19 wickets . = = = v Middlesex = = = At Lord 's , 17 , 19 , 20 July . Middlesex ( 203 and 135 ) lost to the Australians ( 317 and 22 / 0 ) by ten wickets . Denis Compton hit a cautious 62 , but Middlesex lost wickets regularly to fall from 1 / 78 to 203 all out . Five bowlers shared the wickets , Johnston and Loxton taking three apiece . At one stage , Australia were 53 / 3 , but Morris ( 109 ) and Loxton ( 123 ) put on a partnership of 172 . No other batsman bettered Hamence 's 30 , and Jim Sims took 6 / 65 as the Australians collapsed and lost their last six wickets for 46 . Middlesex scored 135 in their second innings , with only John Dewes ( 51 ) and Leslie Compton resisting the tourists , while eight managed only single figures . Five bowlers shared the wickets , and McCool was the only one to take three . McCool and Ring made the 22 required for victory in four overs . = = = v Derbyshire = = = At Derby , 28 , 29 , 30 July . The Australians ( 456 ) defeated Derbyshire ( 240 and 182 ) by an innings and 34 runs . The Australians chose to bat first , and Brown top scored with 140 , his first 50 taking three hours . He shared century stands with Bradman , who made 62 , and Miller ( 57 ) . Loxton later made 51 as the Australians fell away late in the innings , losing 7 / 142 . Derbyshire made 240 in their first innings with the future Test umpire Charlie Elliott top-scoring with 57 , while Miller , Johnston and Ring taking three wicket apiece . The county followed on 216 behind after losing their last six wickets for 64 runs . In their second innings they made 182 , with Denis Smith making 88 , the highest individual score ever made by a Derbyshire player against the Australians . However , only one other player reached double figures , as McCool precipitated a collapse of 9 / 72 , taking 6 / 77 , while Loxton took 3 / 16 . There was a Derbyshire record attendance of 17,000 on the first day . = = = v Glamorgan = = = At Swansea , 31 July , 2 \u2013 3 August . Glamorgan ( 197 ) drew with the Australians ( 215 / 3 ) . Rain prevented play after 3pm on the second day . No one scored more than 40 as Glamorgan elected to bat and made 197 , with the four Australian bowlers , Lindwall , Miller , Johnson and Ring sharing the wickets . The Australians ' 215 / 3 was based on an aggressive 84 from Miller , with five sixes and seven fours , and a partnership of 126 with stand-in Hassett , who was 71 not out when the rain came . The attendance on the two days of play totalled 50,000 . = = = v Warwickshire = = = At Birmingham , 4 , 5 , 6 August . Warwickshire ( 138 and 155 ) lost to the Australians ( 254 and 41 / 1 ) by nine wickets . Bradman put Warwickshire in to bat on a wet pitch and the hosts struggled to 138 in an innings that lasted almost 80 overs . Martin Donnelly ( 28 ) was the only batsman to pass 20 , and Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets each . Australia scored 254 in reply ; Hassett top-scored with 68 , Lindwall made 45 , and the pair 's partnership of 70 was the highest of the match . Three other batsmen reached 30 , but most of the Australians were uncomfortable against the leg spin of Eric Hollies , who opened the bowling and took 8 / 107 , the best innings analysis against the Australians on the whole tour . This performance earned the Warwickshire bowler a call-up for the fifth and final Test . In their second innings Warwickshire made 155 runs , Johnston and McCool taking four wickets each , the former conceding only 32 from 39 overs . Australia made the required 41 by lunch on the third day . = = = v Lancashire = = = At Old Trafford , Manchester , 7 , 9 , 10 August . The Australians ( 321 and 265 / 3 declared ) drew with Lancashire ( 130 and 199 / 7 ) . Cyril Washbrook 's benefit match brought him a then record sum , \u00a3 14,000 , but it was a mixed experience because he injured his right thumb whilst facing Lindwall and withdrew from the England team for the Fifth Test . The Australians scored 321 in their first innings with only Barnes ( 67 ) reaching 50 . Nine of the Australians made a start , reaching 14 , but could not capitalise on their opportunities , and they lost wickets at regular intervals after an opening stand of 123 . The slow left-arm bowler William Roberts took 6 / 73 . Lancashire replied with 130 of which Washbrook made 38 , while Lindwall and Johnson took three wickets apiece , but the Australians did not enforce the follow on . Australia made 265 / 5 declared and Bradman scored an unbeaten 133 , his highest at Old Trafford , with 90 for Barnes . Bradman declared at lunch on the third day after batting the hosts out of the match , but they held on with three wickets in hand after losing two late in the day . Ikin had reached 99 after being repeatedly hit by bouncers . Bradman took the second new ball and gave it to Miller , who refused to bowl , saying that he felt Ikin deserved a century . Lindwall ( 4 / 27 ) was then given the ball and promptly removed Ikin one run short of his century . = = = v Durham = = = At Sunderland , 11 , 12 August . The Australians ( 282 ) drew with Durham ( 73 / 5 ) . In the absence of the resting Bradman , Hassett won the toss and elected to bat . Attendance was 17,000 on the first day of this two-day non-first-class match . Rain prevented any play on the second day . After a poor start that saw them fall to 22 / 3 , McCool ( 64 ) and Miller ( 55 ) made half-centuries for the Australians . Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20 , but none went on . Paceman Keith Jackson took 5 / 76 for the hosts . Five Australian bowlers each took one wicket and Jackson top-scored with 23 before rain ended the match . = = = v Kent = = = At Canterbury , 21 , 23 August . The Australians ( 361 ) defeated Kent ( 51 and 124 ) by an innings and 186 runs . Australia elected to bat first and Brown made 106 , while Bradman ( 65 ) and Harvey ( 60 ) both scored half-centuries . Kent collapsed to the lowest score of the tour in the first innings , succumbing in only 23 overs . Johnston and Loxton both took 3 / 10 , and six local batsmen made ducks . Forced to follow on , half the Kent side were out for 45 in the second innings . Tony Pawson and Godfrey Evans added 71 , but the match , held in front of record crowds for the ground , ended inside two days , soon after Evans was run out . It took the Australians less than 56 overs to get 20 wickets . Lindwall took 4 / 37 in the second innings ; all his wickets were top-order batsmen . = = = v Gentlemen of England = = = At Lord 's , 25 , 26 , 27 August . The Australians ( 610 / 5 declared ) defeated the Gentlemen of England ( 245 and 284 ) by an innings and 81 runs . In his last match at Lord 's , Bradman won the toss and made his ninth century ( 150 ) of the tour against a side composed almost entirely of Test players . Brown ( 120 ) and Hassett ( 200 * ) also scored centuries , and Miller made 69 . Bradman elected to bat into the second day . The Gentlemen responded with 242 of which Reg Simpson made 60 and , following on , 284 , with Bill Edrich making 128 . There were no other scores beyond 30 in either innings . Ring took 5 / 70 for the innings and eight for the match , while Johnson secured seven wickets . The Victorian spin duo bowled the majority of the overs in both innings . = = = v Somerset = = = At Taunton , 28 , 30 August . The Australians ( 560 / 5 declared ) defeated Somerset ( 115 and 71 ) by an innings and 374 runs . After winning the toss , the Australians made all their runs on the first day , with centuries for Hassett ( 103 ) , Harvey ( 126 ) and Johnson ( 113 * ) and 99 for Hamence . The Australians put on 255 for the second wicket , through Hassett and Barnes , who was replaced by Harvey after retiring ill . The other Australian batsmen had all made centuries , and were keen to see Hamence do the same . The rest of the team left their card games in readiness to applaud his impending milestone , only to see him stumped for 99 , his highest score for the season . On the Monday , the second day , on a pitch that was taking spin , Somerset collapsed twice inside four hours and less than 82 overs in total . McCool took 4 / 21 and 4 / 23 , and Johnston also took eight , including 5 / 34 in the second innings . He took the last two wickets of the Somerset first innings as a spinner , and then had Harold Gimblett lbw with the second ball of the second innings as a fast-medium bowler to take three wickets in four balls . = = = v South of England = = = At Hastings , 1 , 2 , 3 September . The Australians ( 522 / 7 declared ) drew with the South of England ( 298 ) . The tourists elected to bat and after losing the openers early , Hassett top scored with 151 , his third consecutive century . He was supported by Bradman ( 143 ) and Harvey ( 110 ) , whose quick scoring enabled the Australians to declare with a large total . Hassett shared partnerships in excess of 150 with both Bradman and Harvey . Harvey 's century took only 90 minutes and Loxton hit 67 in 75 minutes on the second day . The second and third days were continually interrupted by rain , and Compton made 82 in the showers . Bradman gave his regular bowlers a light workload and Brown took 4 / 16 in 4.1 overs to finish off the tail , the only time he bowled in first-class matches on the entire tour . There was no time left for the second innings . = = = v HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI = = = At Scarborough , 8 , 9 , 10 September . HDG Leveson-Gower 's XI ( 177 and 75 / 2 ) drew with the Australians ( 489 / 8 declared ) . This was the final match for Bradman in England , and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions . It was Australia 's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches . During the last Australian campaign in 1938 , this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit , but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play . Bradman then fielded a full-strength team , with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson at the expense of Ring . The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat , but Lindwall took 6 / 59 in an innings that lasted into the second day , bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs . Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively , sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62 . Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his own face , breaking his nose . Australia reached 2 / 407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8 / 469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result . Leveson-Gower 's XI played out time , with Bradman bowling the last over . = = = v Scotland = = = At Edinburgh , 13 , 14 September . The Australians ( 236 ) defeated Scotland ( 85 and 111 ) by an innings and 40 runs . The match against Scotland was a two-day fixture that did not have first-class status . Australia elected to bat and Morris top-scored with 112 , and McCool made 52 , but all struggled against the leg-spin of William Laidlaw , who took 5 / 51 . The Australians collapsed at the end , losing their last six wickets for 36 runs , and only three made double figures . Scotland collapsed against Johnston and Johnson , who took 6 / 15 and 3 / 18 respectively . Forced to follow on , a second innings opening stand of 50 preceded a second collapse , this time Ring and Morris took 4 / 20 and 5 / 10 . Only three Scottish players passed double figures in either innings . = = = v Scotland = = = At Aberdeen , 17 , 18 September . Scotland ( 178 and 142 ) lost to the Australians ( 407 / 6 declared ) by an innings and 87 runs . In another two-day non-first-class match , Scotland batted better than in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat , but still lost . Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts ' 178 , before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool , promoted to open , made 108 , while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5 . Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring . Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities with the ball , and the wickets were shared , with nobody taking more than four .",

                    "text": "Gordon Bennett ( general ) = Lieutenant General Henry Gordon Bennett CB , CMG , DSO , VD ( 15 April 1887 \u2013 1 August 1962 ) was a senior Australian Army officer who served in both World War I and World War II . Despite highly decorated achievements during World War I , during which he commanded at both battalion and brigade level and became the youngest general in the Australian Army , Bennett is best remembered for his role in the Battle of Singapore in February 1942 in the Pacific War , as commander of the 8th Australian Division , he escaped while his men became prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Army . After this , Bennett 's military career waned and although he rose to command a corps , he never commanded troops in battle again . In 1945 , his escape caused controversy and resulted in a Royal Commission , which found that he had been unjustified in relinquishing his command . A citizen soldier , before World War I Bennett had worked in the insurance industry and at the conclusion of hostilities pursued his commercial interests while continuing to serve in the military in a part-time capacity , commanding at brigade and divisional level . He retired from the Army after World War II and turned to farming in the Blue Mountains . He remained active in the world of business and as military commentator , before dying at the age of 75 . = = Early life = = Bennett ( who was always known as Gordon ) was born in Balwyn , Melbourne , on 15 April 1887 , to George Bennett , a South African-born school teacher , and his Australian-born wife , Harriet . He was the sixth of nine children and attended Balwyn State School , where his father taught , and then Hawthorn College as a teenager having been given a three-year scholarship . While at Hawthorn , he did well at mathematics and in 1903 , as a 16-year-old , after completing a competitive examination he was accepted into the AMP Society to train as an actuary . In May 1908 , just after he turned 21 , Bennett volunteered to serve in the Militia , Australia 's reserve military force , joining the 5th Australian Infantry Regiment as a \" recruit officer \" . After completing a six-month part-time course , he was appointed as a provisional second lieutenant , and posted to the regiment 's ' B ' Company , in Carlton , Victoria . He continued to work at AMP during this time , but devoted most of his spare time to his military duties and rose in rank quickly , reaching major in 1912 , at the age of 25 , when he became adjutant of his regiment . At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 , Bennett volunteered to serve with the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) and , after securing his release from AMP on full pay , was appointed second-in-command of the 6th Battalion , which was part of the 2nd ( Victorian ) Infantry Brigade , assigned to the 1st Division . After a short period of training , the 1st Division began to embark for Europe . Just prior to his departure overseas , Bennett became engaged to Bess Buchanan , who he had met at a dance in Canterbury . As an engagement gift , Bess bought her betrothed a miniature photo of herself , set in a gold frame . Bennett carried the picture in his jacket pocket while serving overseas and it later saved his life on the Western Front , deflecting a German bullet . = = Gallipoli = = While in transit , as a result of overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom , the 1st Division was diverted to Egypt with the intention that it would complete its training there before moving to the Western Front at a later date . The decision by the Allies to force a passage through the Dardanelles interrupted this process , as the 1st Division was allocated to take part in the Gallipoli Campaign . During the landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915 , Bennett fought on the southern flank of the Anzac beachhead . He led 300 men of his battalion to an advanced position on Pine Ridge , south of Lone Pine . While directing the defence of this position , Bennett was wounded in the shoulder and wrist and forced to retire to the beach for treatment . When the Turkish forces counter-attacked in the evening , the 6th Battalion force on Pine Ridge was isolated and killed to the last man , including Bennett 's younger brother , Godfrey . Instead of accepting evacuation on a hospital ship , after having his wounds treated , Bennett returned to his battalion . In early May , the 2nd Brigade was selected to move to Cape Helles to reinforce the British forces for the Second Battle of Krithia . After being transferred by boat , on 8 May , Bennett advanced with his battalion in impossible conditions . Bennett was the only officer of the 6th , and one of few in the 2nd Brigade , to survive the advance unscathed , although he was lucky do so ; as he led the charge , a Turkish bullet hit the ammunition pouch he wore , exploding the ammunition in it . He was knocked off his feet , but otherwise unharmed . With a handful of men , he achieved the furthest advance of the attack . He became commander of the 6th Battalion the next day . The battalion was then returned to Anzac by a trawler , and shortly afterwards , Bennett 's command of the battalion was confirmed and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel . Throughout June and July , Bennett 's battalion occupied the front line during a period of reduced tempo fighting as a stalemate developed . On 7 August , when the Allies launched their August Offensive to break the stalemate , the 6th Battalion was involved in one of the supporting attacks at the start of the Battle of Sari Bair . While the best known attack was made by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade at the Nek , the 6th was required to make a similar attack against a neighbouring Turkish position known as German Officers ' Trench from which machine guns enfiladed the Australian positions as far north as the Nek . Two attempts to capture the trench failed . A third attempt was organised and Bennett resolved to lead it himself but the commander of the 1st Division , Major General Harold Walker , after consulting with the corps commander , Lieutenant General William Birdwood , agreed to abandon the attack . The 6th Battalion 's losses totalled 80 killed and 66 wounded . Following the attack on the German Officers ' Trench , Bennett 's battalion was withdrawn from the front line briefly , before relieving the 1st Brigade , which had successfully captured Lone Pine . The August Offensive failed and a further lull in the fighting occurred . The following month , as reinforcements in the shape of the 2nd Division arrived at Anzac , the original Australian units were relieved on a rotational basis , including the 6th Battalion , which was sent back to Lemnos . While there , Bennett was hospitalised with paratyphoid and during his stay in hospital , he received word that he had been appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George ( CMG ) . When the 6th Battalion was returned to Gallipoli , Bennett sought to return with them , but was ordered to sail to England aboard the transport Aquitania for further treatment . As well as his CMG , Bennett was also mentioned in despatches twice for his service at Gallipoli . = = Western Front = = Bennett spent Christmas in Southampton , before returning to Egypt early in January 1916 . There , he rejoined his battalion , which was stationed around Gebel Habeita , defending the Suez Canal . He arrived just as the AIF began a period of reorganisation and expansion , which saw the experienced units of the 1st Division being split to provide cadres to the newly formed 5th Division ; as a part of this , the 6th Battalion was split to help form the 58th Battalion in late February . In March 1916 , the 1st Division moved to France as part of the transfer of the AIF 's infantry formations to the Western Front . Bennett subsequently led the 6th Battalion through the Battle of Pozi\u00e8res . After the 1st and 3rd Brigades had captured the town on 24 July 1916 , the 6th and 8th Battalions of the 2nd Brigade moved in to occupy the ruins where they had to endure a prolonged artillery bombardment . Bennett 's battalion headquarters was in a log hut . The hut received six direct hits from shells but survived due to the debris that had accumulated around it . Shortly after Bennett relocated his HQ the hut was finally demolished . On 26 July Bennett protested at the conditions his men had to endure , reporting : \" My men are being unmercifully shelled . They cannot hold out if an attack is launched . The firing line and my headquarters are being plastered with heavy guns and the town is being swept by shrapnel . I myself am O.K. but the front line is being buried . \" In the capture of Pozi\u00e8res , Bennett 's 6th Battalion suffered 190 casualties , the least by a considerable margin of the 12 battalions in the 1st Division . After this , Bennett continued to serve as the commanding officer of the 6th Battalion , as well as acting as the 3rd Brigade commander . In mid-November , Bennett took a brief leave in London , where he was reunited with his fiancee , Bess , who had sailed from Melbourne with her father to meet him . On 16 November , they were married in Chelsea , and after a short honeymoon in Scotland , Bennett returned to the front . On 3 December 1916 , he was given command of the 3rd Infantry Brigade and promoted to brigadier general , becoming at 29 the youngest general in the Australian Army . He commanded the brigade for the remainder of the war on the Western Front , leading the brigade through several notable actions , including at Bullecourt , Menin Road , and Passchendaele during 1917 , and several actions against the Hindenburg Line in 1918 . While Bennett was serving at the front , his wife remained in England ; he returned to her briefly in November 1917 and again in July 1918 . Just after the war ended , Bess returned to Australia with the couple 's 10-month-old daughter , while Bennett remained in Europe until June 1919 , briefly touring the Rhine and then viewing the London victory parade , where he escorted Lady Birdwood while her husband , Lord Birdwood , the former commander of the Australian Corps , marched . For his service on the Western Front , Bennett received many awards . He received the Order of Danilo from Montenegro in 1917 , was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918 , received a Distinguished Service Order in 1919 and mentioned in despatches a further six times . His attitude towards regular officers and temperament , as well as his tendency to act without clearing his actions with superiors , though , resulted in criticism from senior officers . = = Between the wars = = Upon his return to Australia , Bennett lived at Canterbury with his wife and daughter , while he sought to return to civilian life after his appointment to the AIF was terminated . He was offered his old position at AMP back , having been on full-time leave with pay while serving overseas , but was unhappy with this . He was eventually offered a position in the Commonwealth Bank in Sydney and he moved there with his family . Later , he purchased a textile factory and worked as a clothing manufacturer and public accountant before being appointed chairman of the New South Wales Repatriation Board in 1922 , in which role he was able to help returned soldiers . In 1928 , he was appointed as an administrator of the City of Sydney , along with two other commissioners . He was president of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales between 1931 and 1933 and the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia between 1933 and 1934 , and was involved in several conservative political groups such as the All for Australia League and the Defence of Australia League . Bennett remained active in the military , continuing to serve as part of the Militia , which was reorganised in 1921 following the conclusion of the demobilisation process . From then until 1926 , he served as commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade , before being appointed to command the 2nd Division . In 1930 , he was promoted to the rank of major general and over the ensuing years became increasingly parochial against the small permanent Staff Corps . He was transferred to the unattached list in 1932 . In 1937 , amidst increasing tensions in Europe , he came into conflict with the Military Board after he wrote a number of newspaper articles expressing his concerns about complacent defence policy and the efficiency of regular officers . = = World War II = = When World War II broke out in 1939 , although only 52 , Bennett was passed over for command of the Second Australian Imperial Force , the position going to General Thomas Blamey . The Chief of the General Staff , General Sir Brudenell White , seems to have been opposed to Bennett being given an active command . A. B. Lodge , Bennett 's biographer in the Australian Dictionary of Biography ( ADB ) comments : \" Because of his temperament , he was considered unsuitable for a semi-diplomatic command , and one that involved subordination to British generals . Bennett was as scathing of British officers as he was of Australian regulars . \" Bennett was instead given a command in the Volunteer Defence Corps , the Australian version of the British Home Guard . In July 1940 , he took over command of the Eastern Command Training Depot . After White 's death in the Canberra air disaster in August 1940 , Bennett was appointed commander of the newly formed 8th Division , replacing Vernon Sturdee , who was promoted to White 's former role . In February 1941 , the 8th Division 's headquarters , along with one of its brigades \u2013 the 22nd \u2013 was posted to Malaya in February 1941 , after a request from the British for Australia to contribute troops to bolster the garrison there amid growing concerns of war with the Japanese as part of plans that had been formulated as the pre-war Singapore strategy . The 27th Brigade was also dispatched in August , but the division 's third brigade , the 23rd Brigade remained in Australia . Relations between Bennett and his superiors , and also his subordinate brigade commander , Brigadier Harold Taylor , were not good . Lodge comments : \" Bennett 's dealings with British senior officers , especially with the general officer commanding , Malaya , Lieutenant General A.E. Percival , were devoid of harmony . \" In December 1941 , the Japanese invasion of Malaya began . Bennett found himself in command of an ad hoc force known as \" Westforce \" , which included the Australian 27th Brigade \u2013 but not the 22nd , which had been transferred to III Indian Corps \u2013 and several Indian units . Bennett 's command was not engaged in the early stages of the fighting as the initial Japanese attacks fell on British and Indian units around Kota Bharu and the Thai \u2013 Malay border , but as the Japanese pushed the defenders back and advanced into Johore , the Australians fought several actions throughout January . The most significant of these came around Gemas and Muar , where the Australians experienced some local success before being forced to withdraw to Singapore along with the rest of the Allied forces at the end of the month . On Singapore , Bennett 's command once again included the two Australian brigades \u2013 the 22nd and 27th \u2013 which were allocated the task of defending the north-western sector of the island . On 8 February 1942 , the Japanese launched an assault across the Johore Strait , concentrating upon the sector held by Bennett 's troops . The weight fell on the 22nd Brigade 's area , and as they fought to fend off two Japanese divisions , they were eventually forced to withdraw towards the centre of the island . The 27th Brigade initially managed to hold its sector , but it was subjected to a follow-up assault on 10 February and as the 22nd fell back , it was also forced to withdraw . Heavy fighting followed over the next week , but eventually the Allied troops were pushed across the island to Singapore 's urban areas . On 15 February , Percival began surrender negotiations with the Japanese . That night , Bennett decided that it was his duty to escape from Singapore rather than surrender . He handed over command of the 8th Division to Brigadier Cecil Callaghan . With a few junior officers and some local Europeans , Bennett commandeered a sampan and crossed the Strait of Malacca to the east coast of Sumatra , where they transferred to a launch in which they sailed up the Batang Hari River . They then proceeded by car to Padang , on the west coast of Sumatra . From there Bennett flew to Java and then to Australia , arriving in Melbourne on 2 March 1942 . The fall of Singapore \u2013 the largest capitulation in British military history \u2013 shocked Australians , resulting in the capture of almost 15,000 Australians and many more Indian and British soldiers . Nevertheless , Bennett 's escape was initially regarded as praiseworthy , at least publicly . Prime Minister John Curtin issued a statement that read : I desire to inform the nation that we are proud to pay tribute to the efficiency , gallantry and devotion of our forces throughout the struggle . We have expressed to Major General Bennett our confidence in him . His leadership and conduct were in complete conformity with his duty to the men under his command and to his country . He remained with his men until the end , completed all formalities in connection with the surrender , and then took the opportunity and risk of escaping . Within the military , particularly its senior echelons , Bennett was criticised for leaving his troops . In April 1942 , he was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of III Corps in Perth . At the time , this was an important post , but by 1943 , as the possibility of a Japanese invasion of Australia faded , it became a backwater . Bennett was told by Blamey that he would not be given another active command , and he transferred to the Reserve of Officers in May 1944 . He soon published his account of the Malayan campaign , Why Singapore Fell , which was critical of Percival and other British officers , although his opinions were later challenged by several Australian officers , including Callaghan . Blamey unsuccessfully tried to prevent the book 's publication . Upon retirement from active service , Bennett began writing for a Sydney newspaper and as a correspondent for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . He remained concerned about his soldiers , though , and met the first group of recently freed 8th Division prisoners of war when they arrived in Sydney on the transport Manunda . For their part , the majority of his former soldiers welcomed him , some even hung a sign over the side of the ship , which read : \" We want Bennett \" . They later put it in his car as a gesture of their support . = = Postwar inquiries = = The controversy over Bennett 's actions became public in mid-1945 , when the war ended and Percival and Callaghan were released from Japanese captivity . Percival , who had never got on with Bennett , wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing his command without permission . Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead , and Major Generals Victor Stanke and George Wootten , which found that Bennett was not justified in handing over his command , or in leaving Singapore . Veterans of the 8th Division , who were generally loyal to Bennett , protested against this finding . In November 1945 , Prime Minister Ben Chifley appointed a Royal Commission under Justice George Ligertwood . The Commission concluded that Bennett had disobeyed Percival 's order to surrender . Lodge wrote : While never questioning Bennett 's personal courage , Ligertwood concluded that his action had been unjustified . Bennett 's stated reason for leaving Singapore was that he had learned how to defeat the Japanese ( but had been let down by British and Indian troops ) and he was obliged to communicate his knowledge to military authorities . Yet , he had proved no more proficient than other commanders in Malaya and his tactics were outdated . Just as important to him was his wish to lead the Australian army , a consuming aspiration which had been sharpened by not being given an early command . His prejudice against regular officers and his ambition clouded his professional judgement at the most important point in his career . When his most cherished goals were in tatters , he convinced himself that blame for his failure lay with others . In 1948 , Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Fry , a military lawyer , published the opinion : \" The Royal Commissioner based his report on an interpretation of international law , and did not discuss General Bennett 's action from the standpoint of Australian military law , which placed him under no inflexible obligation to remain on Singapore Island . \" = = Post military and retirement = = Bennett later became an orchardist , purchasing a property and living at Glenorie in the Blue Mountains , until 1955 when , due to deteriorating health following a coronary occlusion , he sold his orchard and moved to Sydney . He travelled to Singapore in 1957 with his wife to attend the opening of the Kranji War Memorial and then in 1960 , travelled to Japan to meet with officers who had fought in Malaya . He wrote a number of articles on military topics and served on the board of a number of companies . From 1960 to 1962 , he was Chairman of Directors of MMI Insurance . He died on 1 August 1962 at Dural , survived by hs wife and daughter . After a state funeral at St Andrew 's Cathedral , his body was cremated . The diary that Bennett kept while serving in Malaya is held at the State Library of New South Wales .",

                    "text": "Charles Blackader = Major-General Charles Guinand Blackader , CB , DSO ( 20 September 1869 \u2013 2 April 1921 ) was a British Army officer of the First World War . He commanded an Indian brigade on the Western Front in 1915 , and a Territorial brigade in Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916 , before being appointed to command the 38th ( Welsh ) Division on the Western Front , a position he held until retiring due to ill-health in May 1918 . Originally joining the Army in 1888 as a junior officer in the Leicestershire Regiment , Blackader 's first active posting was in the late 1890s , when he served on attachment to the West African Frontier Force , closely followed by service during the Boer War , where he commanded a company at the defence of Ladysmith . An efficient and well-regarded administrator , he commanded a series of detached stations in addition to his regimental duties for the next ten years , eventually rising to take command of the 2nd Battalion , Leicestershire Regiment , in 1912 . On the outbreak of the First World War , he commanded his battalion on the Western Front as part of an Indian Army formation ; when his superior officer was promoted in early 1915 , Blackader succeeded him as commander of the brigade , and led it through the Battle of Neuve Chapelle and the Battle of Loos . After the Indian Army was withdrawn from France , Blackader was posted to a second-line Territorial Force brigade training in the United Kingdom . In 1916 , it was sent to Dublin during the Easter Rising ; following the Rising , Blackader presided over a number of the resulting courts-martial , including those of several of the signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic . Later that year , he was ordered to France to take over command of the 38th ( Welsh ) Division , a New Army formation which had suffered heavy losses in the Battle of the Somme . He remained with the division for almost two years , helping retrain and reorganise it as an efficient fighting unit . The division would see significant successes in the Hundred Days Offensive of late 1918 , but by this point Blackader was no longer in command ; he had been invalided home earlier in the year . He died shortly after the war , in 1921 , aged 51 . = = Early life = = Charles Guinand Blackader was born in Richmond , Surrey on 20 September 1869 . His father , Charles George Blackader , was a teacher to a small number of boarding pupils ; he had come from an Army family , and taught at Cheltenham College and Clifton College , Bristol , before moving to private tuition . His mother , Charlotte Guinand , was born in Germany ; her family may have come from Alsace-Lorraine , as Blackader would later describe himself as half-French . During his childhood , the Blackaders moved from Richmond to Southampton , where his father headed the education department at the Hartley Institute , and then to Boulogne , where he taught at Beaurepaire School . Returning from France in 1887 , Blackader studied at the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , where he was regarded as a generally promising pupil ; his marks were highest in administrative and academic subjects , but lower in drawing and physical education . He left Sandhurst in August 1888 , and joined the 1st Battalion , Leicestershire Regiment , as a second lieutenant . The battalion sailed for a posting in Bermuda two weeks after his arrival ; his departure was delayed , however , by remaining in London to marry . The ceremony took place on 2 October , at a registry office in Marylebone , and his biographer notes that it was \" clearly in haste \" - their first child was born six and a half months after the wedding . Such an early wedding was very unusual for a junior officer at this period ; on average , army officers did not marry until their mid-thirties . Blackader and his wife spent a year and a half in Bermuda , where their daughter Dorothy was born in April 1889 , and moved to Nova Scotia when the battalion was transferred there in 1890 ; shortly after arrival , on 21 March , he was promoted to lieutenant on 21 March . Their second daughter Joan was born in April 1892 , and a year later the battalion transferred again , this time to the West Indies ; Blackader was appointed adjutant - the officer responsible for administration - to one wing of the battalion , a force of three companies stationed at Jamaica . In late 1895 , the battalion moved to South Africa , but shortly after arrival Blackader returned to England ; he was promoted to captain on 6 December . = = West Africa and the Boer War = = In late 1897 , Blackader was seconded for service in West Africa , as one of the officers recruited by Frederick Lugard for the newly raised West African Frontier Force . Blackader was attached to the 1st Battalion , under Thomas Pilcher , who described him as always \" cheery and anxious to do his work \" ; he threw himself fully into the organisation of the force , and within six months of his arrival the battalion was able to be deployed successfully on operations against local slave-traders . This was Blackader 's first active service , and saw his first mention in despatches ; it also saw an early appearance of his skill for administration and management , which would mark much of his later career . He left West Africa in January 1899 , after a successful posting , but in ill-health ; a third of the officers sent with him had died while on secondment , and Blackader had contracted malaria as well as suffering an attack of dysentery . He spent six months on leave to recover , and then sailed to take command of a company of the 1st Leicesters , still stationed in South Africa . Blackader joined his company in Natal in early October 1899 . It saw action with the battalion within a few days of the outbreak of the Second Boer War , at the Battle of Talana Hill on 20 October , and again at the Battle of Ladysmith on the 30th . Boer forces surrounded Ladysmith after the battle , and began a four-month siege . The battalion remained in the town , with the monotony broken by an occasional skirmish with the besiegers , until the relief column arrived at the end of February . Following the advance into Natal , they were stationed in Middelburg in October , for a second prolonged period of garrison duty broken by occasional raids in the Transvaal . The battalion 's area of responsibility was extended in April 1901 to take in Witbank , and Blackader was appointed commandant of the railway station and its associated collieries , with over 1,500 staff . Following the battalion 's move up the railway line in July , Blackader was transferred to a new post at Balmoral ; as well as the railway station , he was made responsible for a civilian concentration camp outside the town . These camps were frequently crowded , unhealthy , and badly supplied ; few reports have survived on the Balmoral camp , however , and it is not clear how efficient or otherwise Blackader 's administration was . Blackader had applied for a home posting in December 1900 , as adjutant to a battalion of volunteers ; this had been approved in August 1901 , subject to his being released from duties in South Africa . However , the transfer was delayed , and he did not leave for home until June 1902 , when he sailed on board the SS Bavarian with troops returning for the Coronation of Edward VII . He had been twice mentioned in despatches during the war , received the Queen 's South Africa Medal , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . = = Home service and India = = In August 1902 , Blackader took up his appointment as adjutant of the 1st Volunteer Battalion , Leicestershire Regiment , where he would spend the next two years . This was primarily an administrative post - he was the senior regular officer attached to the battalion , and responsible for its organisation and training . At the end of his tenure he was promoted to major in September 1904 , and left for India a few months later to join the regular 1st Battalion . Shortly after his arrival , he was appointed to command the cantonment at the Purandhar Sanatorium , his fourth administrative posting in five years . He returned to England with the battalion at the end of 1906 , when it moved into camp at Shorncliffe . In the summer of 1907 , he applied to become Chief Constable of Leicester - a move which would have meant leaving the Army - but did not succeed ; the job went to John Hall-Dalwood , a lawyer and ex-Army officer who had made a career in the police . He settled into the undemanding life of a home posting , with an active social as well as sporting calendar ; he and Edward Challenor , a fellow officer in the battalion , won the garrison tennis cup two years running , and Blackader was recorded to have made a good showing at sports as diverse as billiards and soccer . Blackader had passed the exams for \" tactical fitness for command \" of a battalion in 1908 , and was given command of a battalion and promoted to lieutenant colonel in September 1912 . = = First World War = = In August 1914 , on the outbreak of the First World War , Blackader was in India , commanding the 2nd Battalion of the Leicesters , which was mobilised for service as part of the 20th ( Garhwal ) Brigade of the 7th ( Meerut ) Division . The division was sent to France as part of Indian Expeditionary Force A , seeing its first action in the trenches on 29 October . On 19 December a force under Blackader 's command staged a successful attack on the German trenches , though the attack was overshadowed by the beginning of the German attack on Givenchy the following day , through which the Leicesters remained in reserve . = = = Garhwal Brigade = = = Brigadier Keary , commanding the Garhwals , was promoted to command the Lahore Division in January 1915 , and on 8 January Blackader was given the temporary rank of Brigadier-General , assuming command of the Garhwal Brigade in his stead . The Garhwals led the first wave of the Indian Corps ' attack at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on 10 March , Three of the attacking battalions reached their objectives , but one was delayed by strong resistance ; after clearing the last German trenches , the brigade halted to let the second wave pass through . In the attack , two men were awarded the Victoria Cross , and nine the Indian Order of Merit , and Blackader was commended by his corps commander , General Willcocks , who wrote that \" I had learned to respect him and to trust in his judgement . The manner in which he handled his brigade at Neuve Chapelle was good to see , and his report ... is written as brave and modest men write \" . His force had taken heavy losses , however ; the trailing battalion on the flank , the 2 / 39th Garhwal Rifles , lost over half its men and all its officers . The brigade repulsed a heavy attack on the morning of 12 March , but settled into a relatively static position thereafter . On 9 May , the Garhwal Brigade was used as a second wave in the first attacks of the Battle of Aubers Ridge , without success ; they saw action again on the night of 15 May , where the leading battalions met heavy resistance and Blackader was forced to call off the attack . After Aubers Ridge , the corps was then rested in a quiet sector until September , when it deployed for the Battle of Loos . The initial attack was to be made by three divisions , with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front ; Blackader 's brigade , with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters , was on its right flank . Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man 's land under cover of the barrage , the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire , and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches ; the brigade lost momentum and dug in . The Indian Corps was withdrawn after Loos , and as a result this was Blackader 's last major action in command of Indian troops ; by the end of November , the Meerut Division had left France . = = = Ireland = = = He was transferred to command of the 177th ( 2 / 1st Lincoln and Leicester ) Brigade , part of the 59th ( 2nd North Midland ) Division in January 1916 . The 59th was a second-line Territorial Force division , formed from those Territorials and new volunteers who had not volunteered for overseas service . As a result , it was generally undermanned and underequipped , with priority given to equipping its first-line counterpart , and tasked mostly with home defence duties . The 177th Brigade had been formed as the duplicate of the 138th ( Lincoln and Leicester ) Brigade , with two second-line battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment and two of the Leicestershire Regiment . The 59th Division was rushed to Ireland in response to the Easter Rising of April 1916 , where Blackader 's new brigade saw its first active service . Following the Rising , many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts ; ninety were sentenced to death , of whom fifteen were eventually executed . Blackader , as a senior officer , chaired a number of courts-martial , including those of \u00c9amonn Ceannt , Thomas Clarke , Thomas MacDonagh , Patrick Pearse , and Joseph Plunkett , five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic . It appears that Blackader found this task difficult ; after Pearse 's trial , he is reported to have commented that \" I have just done one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do . I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across . There must be something very wrong in the state of things that makes a man like that a rebel . I don 't wonder that his pupils adored him . \" = = = 38th ( Welsh ) Division = = = On 21 June , Blackader was ordered to leave the brigade and go to France ; he described the news of the unexpected posting as \" like a bombshell \" . On 9 July , when the Ivor Philipps was removed from command of 38th ( Welsh ) Division , due to the failure of its hitherto limited attacks against Mametz Wood during the early stages of the Battle of the Somme as well as the poor communication between the division and Corps headquarters , Blackader was named as the preferred replacement by Henry Horne , the Corps commander . Horne was overruled , and the command was temporarily given to Herbert Watts . Under Watts , the division successfully took its objective , Mametz Wood , though with severe losses ; within a week , Watts was back in command of 7th Division and Blackader had taken permanent command . The division had been raised in the New Armies in 1914 with a strong sense of Liberal patronage , and many of its officers had been personally appointed by Lloyd George ; as a result , political convenience had often taken priority over military competence when selecting officers . Under Blackader , a new officer from outside the Welsh Liberal milieu and able to sack his subordinates as he saw fit , the division 's standard improved significantly . It saw service at Pilckem Ridge in the early stages of the Third Battle of Ypres , but from September 1917 onwards it was kept on relatively quiet defensive sectors . The division trained through this period , and in April 1918 was able to mount a limited brigade-size attack , which whilst it involved heavy losses was a clear success in a way that would not have been possible two years earlier . In late May 1918 , Blackader was relieved of command and replaced by Thomas Cubitt , a younger officer . This was not apparently due to incompetence or age \u2013 Douglas Haig had described Blackader 's achievements with 38th Division as \" excellent \" \u2013 but due to illness ; according to Gary Sheffield , he had fallen ill after \" being licked by a rabid dog \" . Under Cubitt 's command , the 38th Division would build on its past training and fight through the Hundred Days Offensive with great success . In November 1918 , Blackader was appointed to command the Southern District in Ireland . For his service in the war , he was appointed an aide-de-camp to the King in 1916 , and made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1917 . He was also made a Commander of the Belgian Order of Leopold , and awarded both the Belgian and French Croix de Guerre . Blackader died , of liver cancer and heart failure on 2 April 1921 , at Queen Alexandra 's Military Hospital , Millbank , London , survived by his wife and two daughters , and leaving a small estate of just under \u00a3 450 . There is a memorial to him in the regimental chapel in Leicester Cathedral . On 1 March 2013 , as a result of research into the circumstances of his death by the In From The Cold Project , he was accepted for commemoration by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in their United Kingdom Book of Remembrance , until June when his grave had been belatedly found at Putney Vale Cemetery ( Section K ) .",

                    "text": "James Hill ( British Army officer ) = Brigadier Stanley James Ledger Hill DSO & Two Bars , MC ( 14 March 1911 \u2013 16 March 2006 ) was a British Army officer , who served as commander of the 3rd Parachute Brigade , part of the 6th Airborne Division , during World War II . Born in Bath , Somerset , Hill was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal Military College , Sandhurst before joining the British Army in 1931 and being commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers . He commanded a platoon for a short period , and was then attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort during the Battle of France in May 1940 , where he oversaw the evacuation of Brussels as well as the beach at De Panne during the evacuation of Dunkirk . After a brief period of time in the Irish Free State , he volunteered for parachute training and joined the 1st Parachute Battalion , and was its commanding officer when its parent formation , the 1st Parachute Brigade , was deployed to North Africa . Hill commanded the battalion during its first airborne operation in North Africa , dropping near the towns of Souk el-Arba and B\u00e9ja , in Tunisia . It secured Beja and then sent out patrols to harass German troops , ambushing a convoy and inflicting numerous German casualties , and defended a bridge at Medjez el Bab , although it was eventually forced to retreat . Hill was wounded during an attack by the battalion on Gue Hill , in which he attempted to capture three Italian tanks using his revolver ; the crews of two were successfully subdued without incident , but the third opened fire and hit Hill in the chest several times . He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) and L\u00e9gion d 'Honneur for his service in North Africa and then evacuated back to England . There he took command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the newly formed 6th Airborne Division , and jumped with the brigade during Operation Tonga , the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5 / 6 June 1944 . After nearly being killed on D-Day , by an aircraft strafing his position , Hill commanded the brigade throughout the rest of the time it was in Normandy , once leading a counter-attack during a German assault and later winning the first Bar to his DSO . After advancing to the Seine , the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn to England in September 1944 , but briefly served in the Ardennes in December during the Battle of the Bulge . Hill then commanded 3rd Parachute Brigade during Operation Varsity , the Allied airborne assault over the River Rhine , where he was nearly killed by a glider containing his own personal Jeep . He then commandeered a motorcycle and rode alongside the brigade as the 6th Airborne Division advanced from the Rhine to the River Elbe , at the end of which he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO as well as the American Silver Star . After the war , he was briefly military governor of Copenhagen , for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross , and also raised and commanded the 4th Parachute Brigade ( Territorial Army ) . Retiring from the British Army in 1949 , he became involved in a number of charities and businesses . He died on 16 March 2006 , aged 95 . = = Early life = = Hill was born on 14 March 1911 , in Bath , Somerset , the son of Major General Walter Hill . He was educated at Marlborough College , where he was the head of the college 's Officer Training Corps , and then attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst ; there he won the Sword of Honour and became captain of athletics . He joined the British Army in 1931 , being commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant into the Royal Fusiliers ( City of London regiment ) , the regiment which his father commanded . He ran the regimental athletic and boxing associations during his service with the regiment , and in 1936 transferred to the Supplementary Reserve in order to marry his first wife , Denys Gunter-Jones . For the next three years he worked as part of his family 's ferry company . = = Second World War = = When the Second World War began in September 1939 , Hill was recalled to his regiment and given command of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Fusiliers ' advance party when the battalion left for France during the same month . The battalion was assigned to the 12th Infantry Brigade , part of the 4th Infantry Division . He then commanded a platoon for several months , when the battalion was stationed along the Maginot Line , before being promoted to the rank of Captain in January 1940 and joining the staff at Allied Headquarters . The Battle of France began in May 1940 , by which time Hill was attached to the command post of Field Marshal Lord Gort ; during this period he was involved in planning the evacuation of the civilian population of Brussels , and also carried Gort 's dispatches to Calais ordering the withdrawal of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) . At the end of the campaign , he took command of the evacuation of the beach at La Panne , and was on the last destroyer to leave Dunkirk . For these actions , he was awarded the Military Cross . On his return to Britain , he was promoted to Major and travelled to Dublin in the Irish Free State , where he planned for the evacuation of British citizens from the city should German forces land there . When this task was completed , he volunteered for the fledgling Parachute Regiment , part of the British Army 's growing airborne forces , and undertook parachute training ; when the 1st Parachute Battalion was formed on 15 August 1941 , he was appointed as its second-in-command . The battalion was part of 1st Parachute Brigade , which by mid-1942 had been expanded into 1st Airborne Division under the command of Major-General F.A.M. Browning . In July 1942 the 1st Parachute Battalion was selected to participate in the Dieppe Raid , and got as far as being loaded onto transport aircraft before poor weather cancelled the operation ; when the raid was planned for a second time the parachute battalion was removed because their deployment was too dependent on there being good weather on the day of the raid . In mid September , as 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength , Browning was informed that Operation Torch , the Allied invasion of North Africa , would take place in November . After being informed that an American airborne unit , the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion , was to be used during the invasion , Browning successfully advocated for the 1st Parachute Brigade to also be included . He argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised during the invasion , as the large distances and comparatively light opposition would provide a number of opportunities for airborne operations . The War Office and Commander in Chief , Home Forces were won over by the argument , and agreed to detach the brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion . After it had been brought to full operational strength , partly by cross posting personnel from the newly formed 2nd Parachute Brigade , and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources , the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November 1942 . = = = North Africa = = = As an insufficient number of transport aircraft were allocated to the brigade , it was only possible to transport the 3rd Parachute Battalion by air . The rest of the brigade arrived at Algiers on 12 November , with some of its stores arriving slightly later . By the evening , reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at Maison Blanche , with the remainder of the brigade following on the morning of 13 November ; it was quartered in Maison Blanche , Maison Carree and Rouiba . After several ambitious airborne operations were planned but then cancelled by British First Army , on 14 November it directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and B\u00e9ja ; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja to ascertain whether they would remain neutral , or support the Allies ; secure and guard the cross roads and airfield at Soul el Arba ; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces . 1st Parachute Battalion was selected for the task , to which Hill objected . The battalion had been forced to unload the vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself , and had also to arrange its own transportation to Maison Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers ; when it had arrived at Maison Blanche , it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield . Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted , and he did not believe all of the battalion 's equipment could be sorted out within twenty four hours ; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period , but this was denied . Hill faced further problems as he planned for the operation . The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before , and there was no time for any training or exercises . There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas , and only a single , small scale map available for navigation . To ensure that the aircraft found the drop zone and delivered the battalion accurately , Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot . The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters , which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters , but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back , landing at Maison Blanche at 11 : 00 . It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day , which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night . 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November , and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk el Arba . Most of the paratroopers landed successfully , but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck mid drop , throttling him ; one officer broke his leg on landing , and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired . The battalion 's second in command , Major Alastair Pearson , remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty . Meanwhile , Hill led the rest of the battalion , approximately 525 strong , in some commandeered trucks towards the town of B\u00e9ja , an important road and railway centre approximately forty miles from the airfield . The battalion arrived at approximately 18 : 00 and was welcomed by the local French garrison , 3,000 strong , which Hill persuaded to cooperate with the paratroopers ; in order to give the garrison and any German observers the impression that he possessed a larger force than he actually did , Hill arranged for the battalion to march through the town several times , wearing different headgear and holding different equipment each time . A short time after the battalion entered B\u00e9ja , German aircraft arrived and bombed the town , although they caused little damage and no casualties . The next day , ' S ' Company was sent with a detachment of engineers to the village of Sidi N 'Sir , about twenty miles away ; they were to contact the local French forces , believed to be pro British , and harass German forces . The detachment found the village and made contact with the French , who allowed them to pass through towards the town of Mateur ; by nightfall the force had not reached the town , and decided to encamp for the night . At dawn a German convoy of armoured cars passed the detachment , and it was decided to set an ambush for the convoy if it returned , with anti-tank mines being laid on the road and a mortar and Bren guns being set up in concealed positions . When the convoy returned at approximately 10 : 00 the leading vehicle struck a mine and exploded , blocking the road , and the other vehicles were disabled with mortar fire , Gammon bombs and the remaining anti tank mines . A number of Germans were killed and the rest taken prisoner , with two paratroopers being slightly wounded . The detachment returned to B\u00e9ja with prisoners and several slightly damaged armoured cars . After the success of the ambush , Hill sent a second patrol to harass local German forces , but it was withdrawn after it encountered a larger German force that inflicted several British casualties ; B\u00e9ja was also bombed by Stuka divebombers , inflicting civilian casualties and destroying a number of houses . On 19 November , Hill visited the commanding officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab , and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion . Hill attached ' R ' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured . German forces soon arrived at the bridge , and their commanding officer demanded that they be allowed to take control of the bridge and cross it to attack the British positions . The French rejected the German demands , and in conjunction with ' R ' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours . The battalion was reinforced by the U.S. 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry , but , despite fierce resistance , the German forces proved to be too strong , and by 04 : 30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded the bridge and the surrounding area to the Germans . Two days later , Hill received information that a strong Italian force , which included a number of tanks , was stationed at Gue Hill . Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks , and the following night moved the battalion , less a small guard detachment that remained at B\u00e9ja , to Sidi N 'Sir where it linked up with a force of French Senegalese infantry . Hill decided that the battalion 's section of 3 inch mortars would cover ' R ' and ' S ' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force , while a small force of sappers would mine the road at the rear of the hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat . The battalion arrived at the hill without incident and began to prepare for the attack ; however , just prior to the beginning of the attack there were several loud explosions from the rear of the hill . The anti tank grenades carried by the sappers had accidentally detonated , killing all but two of them . The battalion lost the element of surprise , and Hill immediately ordered the two companies to advance up the hill . The force reached the top and engaged a mixed force of German and Italian soldiers , who were assisted by three light tanks . Hill drew his revolver , and with his adjutant and a small group of paratroopers advanced on the tanks , firing shots through their observation ports in an attempt to persuade the crews to surrender . This tactic worked on two tanks , but upon reaching the third tank Hill and his men were fired upon by the tank 's crew ; Hill was shot three times in the chest and his adjutant wounded , although the tank crew were swiftly dispatched with small arms fire . Hill survived because of prompt medical treatment , and was replaced as commander of the battalion by Major Pearson , who supervised the routing of the rest of the German and Italian soldiers . = = = Normandy = = = After his injuries were treated , Hill was evacuated to a hospital in North Africa to recover ; although forbidden to do so , he often exercised by climbing out of the window of his hospital ward at night . For his actions in North Africa , he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) , which \" paid tribute to the brilliant handling of his force and his complete disregard of personal danger , \" as well as the French L\u00e9gion d 'honneur . By February 1943 he had recovered from his injuries , and was flown back to England where he met up with Brigadier Gerald W. Lathbury , commander of the newly raised 3rd Parachute Brigade . The War Office had authorised the raising of the brigade on 5 November 1942 , comprising the 7th , 8th and 9th Parachute Battalions , all converted infantry battalions . The 9th Parachute Battalion was in need of a commanding officer and Lathbury offered the job to Hill , who accepted . His first action was to send the entire unit on a forced march , at the end of which he announced that the battalion would \" work a six and a half day week \" with Sunday afternoons off , until it was well-trained and fit . The 3rd Parachute Brigade was initially attached to the 1st Airborne Division , but in April 1943 Lathbury was given command of 1st Parachute Brigade , which departed with 1st Airborne Division at the end of April for the Mediterranean theatre and Operation Husky , the invasion of Sicily . The 3rd Parachute Brigade was detached from the division in March and remained in England , and on 23 April it was transferred into the newly formed 6th Airborne Division with Hill as the brigade 's new commander . On 11 August , 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was attached to the 3rd Parachute Brigade ; although meant to be assigned to the newly formed 5th Parachute Brigade , also attached to the 6th Airborne Division , it instead replaced the 7th Parachute Battalion , which was transferred to the new parachute brigade . The 6th Airborne Division , under the command of Major-General Richard Nelson Gale , was fully mobilised by late December 1943 , with orders to prepare for airborne operations to be conducted during mid-1944 . The division 's first airborne operation would also be the first time it saw combat , conducting Operation Tonga , the British airborne landings in Normandy on the night of 5 / 6 June , D-Day . It was tasked with guarding the left flank of the British amphibious landings by securing the area east of the city of Caen , capturing a number of bridges that spanned several rivers and canals , and then preventing any Axis forces from advancing on the British beaches . The 3rd Parachute Brigade was given several tasks to accomplish . The 9th Parachute Battalion , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway , was to assault and destroy the Merville Gun Battery , as well as capturing high ground and setting up roadblocks . The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was to destroy two bridges , and the 8th Parachute Battalion had the task of destroying three bridges . When the operation began , the brigade suffered from a combination of poor navigation by the pilots of their C-47 Dakota transport aircraft , heavy cloud cover and incorrectly marked drop zones , which led to all of its units being scattered over a wide area ; Hill himself was dropped with several sticks from the 1st Canadian and 9th Parachute Battalions near the River Dives . He landed in a submerged river rank approximately half a mile from Cabourg , and was forced to wade through four feet of water and a number of flooded irrigation ditches before reaching dry land ; the same flooded areas claimed the lives of a number of paratroopers from his brigade . Collecting up a number of his men , he headed for the town of Sallenelles , where he hoped to find out how the 9th Parachute Battalion had fared assaulting the Merville Battery . En route , however , he and his party were strafed by low-flying German aircraft , forcing the paratroopers to dive for cover ; when the aircraft had departed Hill stood up again , finding that he had been wounded in the buttocks and the officer next to him had been killed . Most of the other men had either been killed or wounded during the attack , leaving only himself and the commander of his headquarters defence platoon ; once first aid had been administered to the wounded , Hill continued on and finally managed reach Ranville , where the headquarters of the General Officer Commanding ( GOC ) , Major-General Gale , had been set up . After being informed by Gale that his brigade had successfully completed its objectives , Hill had his wound tended to , and then travelled to his own headquarters ; there he found Lieutenant Colonel Pearson in temporary command , who informed him that many the brigade 's staff had been killed during the drop . By 00 : 00 on the night of 6 / 7 June , the entire division was fully deployed on the eastern flank of the invasion beaches . The 3rd Parachute Brigade was holding a 4-mile ( 6.4 km ) front , with the 9th Parachute Battalion at Le Plein , 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion at Les Mesneil and the 8th Parachute Battalion in the southern part of the Bois de Bavent . For the rest of its time in Normandy the division acted in an infantry role . From 7 June until 16 August , it first consolidated and then expanded its bridgehead . The 3rd Parachute Brigade was responsible for a section of front around the Chateau Saint Come and a nearby manor , with the latter being used as the brigade 's primary defensive position . The brigade was positioned next to the 1st Special Service Brigade , and from 7 June onwards German pressure rapidly increased against both brigade 's positions , with a number of attacks being repelled between then and 10 June . On 10 June the decision was taken to expand the bridgehead to the east of the River Orne , with the 6th Airborne Division tasked with achieving this ; however , it was deemed not to be strong enough , and the 5th Battalion , Black Watch was placed under the 3rd Parachute Brigade 's command ; the battalion launched an attack on the town of Breville on 11 June , but was met with extremely heavy resistance and was repulsed after suffering a number of casualties . The next day 3rd Parachute Brigade 's entire front was subjected to fierce artillery bombardment and assaults by German tanks and infantry , with the Germans particularly focusing on the positions held by 9th Parachute Battalion . Both the 9th Parachute Battalion and the remnants of the 5th Black Watch defended the Chateau Saint Come but were gradually forced to retreat . Lieutenant Colonel Otway informed brigade headquarters , some 400 metres ( 1,300 ft ) away , that his battalion would be unable to hold its ground for much longer ; upon hearing this message , Brigadier Hill gathered together forty paratroopers from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion and led a counter-attack that forced the German troops to withdraw . German attempts to breach the 9th Parachute battalions ' positions did not end until 12 June , and Hill stated that the period 7 \u2013 12 June were \" five of the toughest days fighting I saw in five years of war . \" It was during this period that Hill was awarded the first Bar to his Distinguished Service Order , after supervising an assault by 12th Parachute Battalion on the town of Breville ; the town dominated a long ridge near the Allied bridgehead , from which the German 346th Infantry Division launched repeated attacks . From then on until mid-August the division remained in static positions , holding the left flank of the Allied bridgehead and conducting vigorous patrolling . Finally , on 7 August the division was ordered to prepare to move over to the offensive , and on the night of 16 / 17 August it began to advance against stiff German opposition , its ultimate objective being the mouth of the River Seine ( see 6th Airborne Division advance to the River Seine ) . Hill 's 3rd Parachute Brigade led the division 's advance , being held up until nightfall at the village of Goustranville , but then securing several bridges and allowing the 5th Parachute Brigade to pass through its positions and continue the division 's advance . The brigade remained around the Dives canal for several days , and then on 21 August it advanced towards Pont L 'Eveque , but was stalled by German infantry and armour near Annebault until 8th Parachute Battalion secured the village . Fighting continued to be fierce , but by 24 August the entire division had advanced across the River Touques . After another three days of reorganising and patrolling , the division 's time in Normandy came to an end ; in nine days it had advanced 45 miles , captured 400 square miles ( 1,000 km2 ) of occupied territory and taken prisoner over 1,000 German soldiers . Its casualties for the period were 4,457 , of which 821 would be killed , 2,709 wounded and 927 missing . It was finally withdrawn from the frontline in the last days of August , and embarked for England at the beginning of September . = = = Ardennes = = = On 16 December 1944 , the Germans launched a huge offensive in the Ardennes forest , with the German objective to split British and American forces apart and capture the port of Antwerp , an important logistical base for the Allies . The initial assaults were extremely successful , creating a salient some fifty miles wide and forty-five miles deep , and by 23 December German units were advancing towards Dinant . American resistance was fierce , however , and blunted German advances in several areas , particularly the U.S. 101st Airborne Division around the town of Bastogne . By Christmas Day the offensive had been halted and contained , and an Allied counter-offensive began . Although the majority of the troops committed belonged to the American First and Third Armies , British XXX Corps also participated , with the British 6th Airborne Division as one of its leading divisions . The division had been in England since the beginning of September , and had been due to go on Christmas leave only days before the counter-offensive began ; however , it was quickly transported to the Ardennes , arriving on the night of 24 December . By 26 December the 6th Airborne Division , now commanded by Major-General Eric Bols , had positioned itself between the towns of Dinant and Namur , and on 29 December it advanced against the German salient , with the 3rd Parachute Brigade , under James Hill , occupying an area around Rochefort . When the German offensive had begun , Hill had been in hospital , undergoing reconstructive plastic surgery ; this meant that he was unable to join the 3rd Parachute Brigade for two days . When he had recovered , however , he and his batman were flown to the Ardennes and he was able to rejoin the brigade . The 5th Parachute Brigade launched several attacks against German positions in the village of Bure , which resulted in heavy British casualties , and both brigades conducted a large number of offensive patrols . The 3rd Parachute Brigade did not see any action , as those German units occupying positions opposite to it withdrew without fighting . By the end of January , however , the division was transferred back to the Netherlands and set up new positions along the Maas river , where it conducted more patrolling against elements of the German 7th Parachute Division , which held positions on the other side of the Maas . These operations came to an end in late February , when the 6th Airborne Division was withdrawn back to England to prepare for a major airborne operation in March . = = = Rhine = = = On 24 March 1945 Operation Varsity began , an airborne operation to aid in the establishment of a bridgehead on the east bank of the River Rhine which involved the British 6th Airborne Division and the U.S. 17th Airborne Division , under Major General William Miley . Varsity was the airborne component of Operation Plunder , in which the British Second Army , under Lieutenant-General Miles C. Dempsey , and the U.S. Ninth Army , under Lieutenant General William Simpson , crossed the Rhine at Rees , Wesel , and an area south of the Lippe Canal . Both divisions would be dropped near the town of Hamminkeln , and were tasked with a number of objectives : they were to seize the Diersfordter Wald , a forest that overlooked the Rhine , including a road linking several towns together ; several bridges over a smaller waterway , the River Issel , were to be seized to facilitate the advance ; and the town of Hamminkeln was to be captured . The 6th Airborne Division was specifically tasked with securing the northern portion of the airborne bridgehead , including Hamminkeln , a section of high ground to the east of Bergen , and several bridges over the River Issel . Hill 's 3rd Parachute Brigade was to drop at the north-eastern corner of the Diersfordterwald forest and clear the western portion of the forest . It would then seize a hill known as the Schneppenberg , secure a road junction near Bergen and eventually link up with the 5th Parachute Brigade . The 3rd Parachute Brigade dropped nine minutes later than planned , but otherwise landed accurately on drop zone ' A ' . Hill landed near to the Diersfordterwald forest , which was occupied by German soldiers \" who are switched-on people , \" killing a number of paratroopers whose parachutes became tangled up in the trees . His brigade headquarters was positioned by a copse which was supposed to have been immediately cleared , but when he arrived it was still occupied by German troops ; Hill immediately ordered a company commander of the 8th Parachute Battalion to clear the copse . The officer did so , but was killed in the process . Hill then moved his headquarters to the copse , but was then nearly killed by an approaching glider which barely managed to pull up in time , landing in the trees above him ; upon investigation , Hill discovered that it contained his batman and personal Jeep , which took some time to lower down safely . The brigade suffered a number of casualties as it engaged the German forces in the Diersfordter Wald , but by 11 : 00 hours the drop zone was all but completely clear of enemy forces and all battalions of the brigade had formed up . The key town of Schnappenberg was captured by the 9th Parachute Battalion in conjunction with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion , the latter unit having lost its commanding officer to German small-arms fire only moments after he had landed . Despite taking casualties the brigade cleared the area of German forces , and by 13 : 45 Hill could report that the brigade had secured all of its objectives . With Varsity a success , the 6th Airborne Division was ordered by Major General Matthew Ridgway , commander of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps , to advance eastwards . It was supported by the 6th Guards Tank Brigade , and many of the airborne troops used unconventional transport during the advance , including captured German staff cars , prams and even horses . Hill requisitioned a motorcycle for his batman and travelled alongside the 3rd Parachute Brigade as it advanced ; at one point his batman stopped the motorcycle and relieved a captured German colonel of his binoculars before driving off again . Hill disapproved of battlefield looting and admonished his batman , although eventually relented by stating \" If you can get me a pair [ as well ] , you can keep them ! \" At midnight , 27 / 28 March the division came under the control of British VIII Corps , commanded by Lieutenant-General Evelyn Barker , and became part of the general Allied advance through Germany towards the Baltic Sea , with the 3rd Parachute Brigade as the division 's leading unit . German resistance continued to be heavy , but the division managed to advance at a rapid pace despite this , with the brigade at one point advancing fifteen miles in twenty-four hours , with eighteen of those being spent in combat . By early April the 6th Airborne reached the River Weser , with the brigade approaching it near the town of Minden , accompanied by armoured support ; as it did so , the brigade found itself moving parallel to several German tanks , with Hill sitting on the rear of one of the British tanks . Both sides opened fire , but did little damage , the two German tanks managing to outpace the brigade . The brigade continued its fast pace of advance , with Hill continuing to ride pillion on his motorcycle , and by 23 April it had reached the River Elbe , having advanced 103 miles in fourteen days ; the division had captured more than 19,000 prisoners during this period . After crossing the Elbe , the division once again came under the command of U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps , with General Ridgway informing Major General Bols that it was vital the division reach the port of Wismar before the approaching Russian Army did , to ensure that Denmark was not occupied by the Soviet Union . Although the 5th Parachute Brigade was ordered to lead the division 's advance , Hill was determined to reach Wismar first ; after an extremely rapid advance he succeeded , with troops from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion being the first to enter Wismar , beating an advancing Russian tank column by only a few miles . A few days later , on 7 May 1945 , Germany surrendered and the war in Europe came to an end . Hill was awarded a second Bar to his DSO for his command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade during its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe , as well as the American Silver Star . = = Post-war career = = In May 1945 Hill served as military governor of Copenhagen , for which he was awarded the King Haakon VII Liberty Cross , and then assumed command of the 1st Parachute Brigade and oversaw its demobilisation . He retired from the British Army in July 1945 , although he continued to serve as an officer in the Territorial Army , raising the 4th Parachute Brigade ( Territorial Army ) in 1947 and serving as its commanding officer until 1949 . After standing down as commander of the brigade , Hill served on the board of a number of companies , including Lloyds Bank , the Associated Coal and Wharf Companies , and Powell Duffryn of Canada . Hill was an avid birdwatcher , with a particular claim to fame for being only the second person to discover a cuckoo 's egg in the nest of a whinchat . He also helped to set up the Parachute Regiment Association and the Airborne Forces Security fund , acting as a trustee of the latter organisation for thirty years and chairman for five years . Hill married for a second time , wedding Joan Patricia Haywood in 1986 . On 6 June 2004 he attended the 60th Anniversary of the Normandy landings , and a bronze statue of him was unveiled at Le Mesnil crossroads by Charles , Prince of Wales , Colonel-in-Chief of The Parachute Regiment . He died on 16 March 2006 , two days after his 95th birthday . He is survived by his second wife and a daughter from the first marriage , Gillian Bridget Sanda .",

He commanded the 3rd Canadian Division during some of the bitterest battles of the war , taking over in 1915 after his predecessor was killed . He himself was killed in action less than a month before the end of the war during a reconnaissance mission observing German positions along the River Selle . A highly experienced officer , Lipsett had previously seen action in the Tirah Campaign and the Second Boer War with the British Army , serving as an officer with the Royal Irish Regiment . He was later instrumental in developing military training and education throughout Canada and expanding the shore defences of British Columbia in response to the threat of the German East Asian Cruiser Squadron under von Spee . An experienced and capable officer , Lipsett was popular with both his men and his superiors and his death was considered \" a deplorable loss to the Division \" . = = Early military career = = Born in Ballyshannon , County Donegal , Ireland , to Richard and Etty Lipsett in June 1874 , Lipsett was raised in Merthyr Tydfil , Wales , and Bedford , England , following his father 's death in 1887 . He was educated at Bedford School and took the Sandhurst entrance examination against the wishes of his tutors , entering the college and graduating 35th from his class of 120 . In 1894 , Lipsett was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Irish Regiment , and took ship to India where he served for the next five years on the Northwest Frontier , participating in the Tirah Campaign against the Afridi . During these campaigns he conducted himself with distinction , being promoted to lieutenant but also contracting a near-fatal bout of cholera . In 1899 he and his regiment were ordered to South Africa for service in the Second Boer War . Although he did not serve in any significant actions Lipsett performed his duties well , in 1901 was promoted to captain and on his return to England in 1903 was recommended to the Staff College , Camberley . In 1905 he returned to South Africa as a staff officer ( Deputy-Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster-General ) , to aid in the reconstitution of colonial government , a task he performed until 1907 , when he was posted back to his regiment . Based at Aldershot , Lipsett conducted both regimental business and operated as an aide-de-camp to the commander of the 2nd Division , Theodore Edward Stephenson . In 1911 , Lipsett responded to the call from the Colonial Office for young staff officers to operate in colonial military academies , as military education had been standardised throughout the British Empire in 1909 . Lipsett was sent to Canada and promoted to major ( in 1913 ) , working hard to improve training in the Dominion . He instigated numerous new training courses and special schools , establishing close ties with the Canadian military establishment and personally training most of the next generation of Canadian staff officers and generals . = = First World War = = At the outbreak of the First World War Lipsett was dispatched to British Columbia , the Pacific coastline of which was largely undefended and was believed to be at risk from the German East Asian Cruiser Squadron under Maximilian von Spee , which had embarked on a raiding campaign in the Pacific Ocean that would culminate in the Battle of Coronel and the Battle of the Falkland Islands . Lipsett recognised that there was no immediate threat to the Canadian coast and calmed fears whilst simultaneously organising the local militia forces and deploying the two submarines purchased by provincial Premier Richard McBride . His task completed in British Columbia , Lipsett took over command and training of the 8th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force . A friend recalled that as a commanding officer he was \" always accessible and charming in manner , yet there was that about him which made him respected and no one ever presumed on his kindness , except the few old soldiers , who with their war ribbons up , and uncanny intuition , never failed to touch a soft spot in his heart . \" In 1915 the 8th Battalion joined the British Army in France as part of the 3rd Canadian Division . At the Second Battle of Ypres his troops faced the brunt of the German assault , involving the first use of poison gas in modern warfare . Lipsett is credited with issuing the first order to counteract the effects of poison gas , when he ordered his men to urinate on strips of cloth and tie them to their faces to neutralise the chlorine . Lipsett 's battalion was instrumental in holding the line during the action and he was consequently rewarded by being made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George , promoted to acting brigadier-general and given command of the Canadian 2nd Brigade , which he trained during the spring of 1916 to conduct major trench raids on German lines . = = = 3rd Canadian Division = = = On 2 June 1916 , Lipsett 's commanding officer Malcolm Mercer was killed by enemy shellfire at Mount Sorrel in Belgium and Lipsett was given an acting promotion to replace him in command of the 3rd Canadian Division , and a brevet promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel . The Canadian Minister of Militia and Defence Minister Sir Sam Hughes attempted to have him removed from the division in favour of Hughes ' son Garnet , but Lipsett was so highly regarded in the Canadian military establishment that General Byng overruled Hughes . Lipsett led his division through the worst of the campaigns in 1916 , including extensive operations during the Battle of the Somme . He received promotion to substantive Lieutenant-Colonel in February 1917 , and in April 1917 Lipsett 's division was instrumental in the Canadian success at the Battle of Vimy Ridge . The following September however the division took heavy casualties in bitter fighting at the Battle of Passchendaele . After each of these battles , Lipsett was forced to reconstitute and retrain his units with fresh drafts , so severe were the casualties the division took . In August , 1918 he was involved in the planning and execution of an assault on German positions by the entire Canadian Corps which is known as the Battle of Amiens which was completely successful and for which he was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath . Through the rest of the month he was engaged in combat with the division , but at the start of September Arthur Currie and Douglas Haig arranged his transfer to the command of the British 4th Division in order that the Canadian Corps be entirely officered by Canadians . = = = Death = = = Although Lipsett was unhappy about the transfer , he acquiesced and took energetic command of the division during the Hundred Days Offensive . On 14 October 1918 , whilst planning an assault at Saulzoir in France he was crawling along a bank overlooking the River Selle with several officers of his own staff and some of the 49th Division , when at about 3 : 15 in the afternoon the party was spotted and a German machine gun opened fire from across the river . The party went to ground but a single bullet struck Lipsett in the face . He was able to stagger back to his own lines but there collapsed from massive blood loss and never regained consciousness . He was the last British general to be killed during the First World War . Lipsett was buried the following day in Qu\u00e9ant Communal Cemetery at a funeral attended by dozens of officers from the British and Canadian armies in France . The burial party was provided by the 8th Battalion , C.E.F. and amongst the mourners was the Prince of Wales . After the war he was posthumously awarded the Croix d 'officier de la Legion d 'honneur and the Croix de Guerre by the French government . Lipsett is remembered in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography as \" arguably the best \" Canadian officer of the Great War , \" a shrewd and thoughtful tactician whose pre-war professional dedication paid off under fire from Ypres to Amiens \" and who \" set an example of fearlessness and disregard of danger to those under him at all times and in all places ; in fact to lead and not to follow was the ideal which he set for himself and lived up to the end . \"",

                    "text": "Walther von Brauchitsch = Heinrich Alfred Hermann Walther von Brauchitsch ( 4 October 1881 \u2013 18 October 1948 ) was a German field marshal and the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army in the early years of World War II . Born into an aristocratic military family , Brauchitsch joined the 3rd Guards Grenadier Regiment 1901 . He served on the staff of several formations that fought over a dozen major battles of World War I , serving with the XVI Corps , 34th Infantry Division and Guards Reserve Corps as a staff officer before taking part in no fewer than twenty-eight notable clashes on the Western Front , including the Battle of Verdun , the Battle of Armenti\u00e8res , the Battle at the Aisne , and the Battle of the Lys . For his service on the Western Front , he was awarded the Iron Cross and the House Order of Hohenzollern . After Hitler 's rise to power in 1933 , Brauchitsch was put in charge of the East Prussian Military District , and became a popular officer because of his kindness to the civilian Prussian population in times of local fires . Although he personally disliked Nazism , he borrowed immense sums of money from Hitler and eventually became dependent on his financial help . Brauchitsch primarily served as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army before World War II , from 1938 , and during the two first years of war , until 1941 . He played a key role in the Battle of France and oversaw the German military campaigns in Yugoslavia and Greece . For his part in Battle of France , Brauchitsch became one of 12 generals promoted to field marshal on 19 July 1940 . After a first heart attack in November 1941 and the failed Moscow offensive in December 1941 , Hitler dismissed him as Commander-in-Chief of the Army ; he spent the rest of the war in enforced retirement , and never saw Hitler again . After World War II , Brauchitsch was arrested on charges of war crimes , but died of a heart attack in 1948 before he could be prosecuted . Brauchitsch married Elizabeth von Karstedt , an heiress from Brandenburg , in 1910 , with whom he had three children . They were divorced in 1938 and , shortly after , he married Charlotte R\u00fcffer . = = Early life = = Brauchitsch was born in Berlin on 4 October 1881 as the sixth child of Bernhard Eduard von Brauchitsch , a cavalry general , and his wife Charlotte Bertha von Gordon , a housewife . The Brauchitsch family , which originally came from Silesia , had a long tradition of military service , and like his forefathers , Brauchitsch was raised in the tradition of the Prussian officer corps . His family moved in the leading social circles of Berlin 's high society , and his family name and father 's military rank put him on equal footing with any officer or official . In his teens , Brauchitsch was interested in liberal and conservative politics , and was fascinated by the fine art pieces that were sculpted in Berlin in the late 1880s . To help him pursue these interests , his father enrolled him at Franz\u00f6sisches Gymnasium Berlin rather than a military academy . In 1895 Brauchitsch joined the military academy in Potsdam . He later transferred to the Hauptkadettenanstalt Gro\u00df Lichterfelde , where in his final year he belonged to the \" Selekta \" ( top class for gifted students ) . and was chosen , as his brother Adolf five years before , as a page by Empress Augusta Victoria . During his time serving the empress at court , he learned manners and bearing that were noted for the rest of his life . Upon graduation he received his commission and joined the 9th Company of the 3 . Garde-Grenadier-Regiment \" K\u00f6nigin-Elisabeth \" in Charlottenburg as second lieutenant on 22 March 1900 . A medical condition made him unfit for service in the infantry , and Brauchitsch made a request for secondment to the recently formed 3 . Garde-Feldartillerie-Regiment ( 3rd Guards Field Artillery Regiment ) , which was granted on 1 December 1900 . After the secondment of six months , the commander of the regiment approved his permanent transfer to the regiment , where Brauchitsch , himself a keen horseman , was put in charge of training recruits in riding and driving . While serving as an adjutant and later staff officer of his regiment , he noticed that his fellow officers and superiors showed no particular interest in artillery tactics . As he considered artillery to be his specialty , he instead joined the General Staff office in Berlin , where he was promoted to first lieutenant ( in 1909 ) . = = World War I = = By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Brauchitsch had reached the rank of captain ( promoted in 1913 ) , and was appointed staff officer to the XVI Army Corps stationed near Metz . He would be in the thick of the Great War from start to finish serving in the 34th Infantry Division and Guards Reserve Corps . Between 1914 and 1916 , he was based near Othain , V\u00e9ry , and Varennes , where he took part in the Battle of Verdun and Battle of the Argonne Forest . In the remaining two years of the conflict , Brauchitsch saw more action , taking part in notable engagements such as the third Battle of the Aisne , the Battle of Aisne-Marne , the second Battle of the Aisne , the Battle of Armenti\u00e8res , and the Battle of Flanders . His contributions to the war effort did not go unnoticed ; Brauchitsch was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class and the House Order of Hohenzollern , and ended the war with the rank of major . = = Weimar Republic = = The German military underwent a forced reduction in 1919 to comply with the Treaty of Versailles , but Brauchitsch managed to stay in the military . He remained with the General Staff , where he had no opportunity to use his knowledge of artillery . Eventually , in 1920 , he was permitted to transfer to the staff of the 2nd Artillery Regiment . The following year , he worked in the Ministry of the Reichswehr , in the Artillery Department . Brauchitsch 's assignment in the Artillery Department was to reorganize artillery formations and implement lessons learned in the closing months of the war . He added ideas of his own , including modifying the classification system for light , medium , and heavy artillery . Heavy artillery , formerly known as \" corps artillery \" , now became \" reinforcement artillery \" . He also added emphasis on the combination and co-operation between artillery and infantry . After three years in the Artillery Department , he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1925 . As of 1 November 1927 , Brauchitsch was appointed Chief of Staff of the 6th Infantry Division in M\u00fcnster , Westphalia , one of the strongest garrisons in the west of Germany . In the last years of the Weimar Republic , he took over the Army Training Department and became a colonel ( promoted in 1928 ) . = = Nazi Germany = = In 1933 , Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power and began to expand the military , in order to realize Hitler 's military ambitions . Two years before , Brauchitsch had received his major general promotion . On 1 February 1933 , he was named commander of the East Prussian Military District ( Wehrkreis I ) and Chief of the 1st Division in K\u00f6nigsberg . As a consequence of the German re-armament the command position Befehlshaber im Wehrkreis I ( Commander of the 1st Military District ) was expanded . The staff of the 1st Division formed the staff of the 1st Army Corps and Brauchitsch was appointed its first commanding general on 21 June 1935 . Although Brauchitsch felt at home in Prussia , he had a clash with Erich Koch , the local Gauleiter ( party head and de facto head of civil administration of the province ) . Koch was known as somewhat of a crook who greatly enjoyed the power he possessed , and who would bring violence to his enemies . As neither Koch nor Brauchitsch wanted to lose their jobs in the region , the two attempted to keep their feud unofficial . As a result , Berlin hardly learned of their dispute . A dispute emerged a few years later , when Brauchitsch learned that Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler planned to replace the army guards in East Prussia with SS men , with the purpose of persecuting Jews , Protestant and Catholic churches in the district . Even though Brauchitsch managed to prevent the SS replacement of the army troops in the region , Himmler categorized him as \" a junker \" , and informed Hitler of the disagreement . Brauchitsch claimed he had done his duty , saying laconically , \" Civilians are not allowed to enter that area . \" Brauchitsch obtained the rank of general of artillery in 1936 . So when the Commander-in-Chief of the Army , Werner von Fritsch , was accused of homosexuality , Hitler appointed Brauchitsch a colonel general and the new army chief , on the recommendation of the Army High Command on 4 February 1938 . The homosexual allegations were in reality a trap set by Hitler as an excuse to dismiss one of the aristocratic senior officers within the Army High Command . Fritsch 's removal was a severe test of the stability of the German internal administration of that time . Brauchitsch welcomed the Nazi policy of rearmament . The relationship between Hitler and Brauchitsch improved during Brauchitsch 's confusion about whether to leave his wife for his mistress , in the middle of the Munich Crisis ; Hitler set aside his usual anti-divorce sentiments and encouraged Brauchitsch to divorce and remarry . Hitler even lent him 80,000 Reichsmarks so he could afford the divorce . Over time , Brauchitsch became largely reliant on Hitler for financial help . Like Colonel General Ludwig Beck , Brauchitsch opposed Hitler 's annexation of Austria and intervention in Czechoslovakia , although he did not resist Hitler 's plans for war , again preferring to refrain from politics . In the final months before World War II , Brauchitsch focused on Italy 's potential to aid the Nazi military cause . This turned out not to be an easy task , as the Italian leader Benito Mussolini expected economic support from the Reich in return for his military collaboration . Fritsch had already told Brauchitsch that the Italian military was in \" extremely poor fighting shape \" . Joachim von Ribbentrop , Germany 's Foreign Minister and the main architect of the Axis alliance , constantly interfered with Brauchitsch 's efforts , as he wanted to see his work consolidated at all costs . = = World War II = = Even though Brauchitsch was in charge of operational affairs during the Polish and French campaigns , he had very little influence , as a whole , as to the war 's progress . During the invasion of Poland , he oversaw most plans . The campaign was often cited as the first example of \" blitzkrieg \" . Blitzkrieg was not a theory or an official doctrine . The Polish Campaign did not resemble the popular perception of what became known as blitzkrieg . The Panzer Divisions were spread thinly among the infantry and were not granted operational independence or grouped en masse , as they would in Western Europe . The operative method of the Wehrmacht in Poland followed the more traditional Vernichtungsgedanke . What is commonly referred to as blitzkrieg did not develop until after the campaign in the west in June 1940 . It was not the cause but rather the consequence of victory . Brauchitsch himself had to be convinced that armour could act independently at the operational level , before the campaign . By early November 1939 , Brauchitsch and Chief of the General Staff Franz Halder started to consider overthrowing Hitler , who had fixed \" X-day \" , the invasion of France , as 12 November 1939 . Both officers believed that the invasion was doomed to fail . On 5 November 1939 , the Army General Staff prepared a special memorandum purporting to recommend against launching an attack on the Western powers that year . Brauchitsch reluctantly agreed to read the document to Hitler and did so in a meeting on 5 November . Brauchitsch attempted to talk Hitler into putting off X-day by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than in 1918 , a statement that enraged Hitler . He harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence . Brauchitsch went on to complain : The aggressive spirit of the German infantry is sadly below the standard of the First World War ... [ there has been ] certain symptoms of insubordination similar to those of 1917 \u2013 18 . \" Hitler flew into a rage , accusing the General Staff and Brauchitsch personally of disloyalty , cowardice , sabotage , and defeatism . He returned to the army headquarters at Zossen , where he \" arrived in such poor shape that at first he could only give a somewhat incoherent account of the proceedings . \" After that meeting , both Brauchitsch and Halder told Carl Friedrich Goerdeler , a key leader of the anti-Nazi movement , that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do and that he should find other officers to take part in the plot . Hitler called a meeting of the General Staff , where he declared that he would smash the West within a year . He also vowed to \" destroy the spirit of Zossen \" , a threat that panicked Halder to such an extent that he forced the conspirators to abort their second planned coup attempt . On 7 November , following heavy snowstorms , Hitler put off X-Day until further notice , which removed Brauchitsch and Halder 's primary motivation for the plot . While preparations were underway for the Battle of France , a German planner and strategist named Erich von Manstein , then serving as chief of staff of Army Group A , presented his famous Sichelschnitt ( \" sickle cut \" ) plan . Brauchitsch and Halder , however , did not approve of the plan . When Manstein insisted on the plan being accepted , Halder suggested transferring Manstein far away to the east , so as to reduce his influence in the planning process . Brauchitsch agreed and transferred him to Silesia . However , Hitler invited a group of officers to lunch , and Manstein was among them . He managed to present his plan directly to Hitler . The following day , Hitler ordered Brauchitsch to accept Manstein 's plan , which the F\u00fchrer presented as his own . Despite his original scepticism , Brauchitsch eventually saw the plan 's potential and felt that the army had a real chance of success in France . After the surprisingly swift fall of France , Brauchitsch was promoted to field marshal in July 1940 , during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony . After France had been occupied and divided , he and the rest of the high command were looking forward to a similarly easy and swift campaign against Great Britain , now seriously weakened by the French campaign . He was confident that Britain would be easily defeated : \" We consider the victory already won . England remains secure , but only so long as we choose . \" Had Operation Sealion , the plan for the invasion of Britain , succeeded , Hitler intended to place Brauchitsch in charge of the new conquest . As the Luftwaffe could not gain the requisite air superiority , the Battle of Britain was lost and so the plan was shelved and eventually cancelled . In the swift invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia and Greece in early April 1941 , the Germans committed some 337,000 men , 2,000 mortars , 1,500 artillery pieces , 1,100 anti-tank guns , 875 tanks and 740 other armoured fighting vehicles , all of which were under the overall command of Brauchitsch . By the end of the month , all of Yugoslavia and Greece were in German hands . Brauchitsch supported harsh measures against the Polish population , which he claimed were needed for securing German Lebensraum ( \" living space \" ) . He had a central role in the death sentences for Polish prisoners taken in the defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig , rejecting the clemency appeal . He ordered his army and commanders to cease criticism of racist Nazi policies , as harsh measures were needed for the \" forthcoming battle of destiny of the German people \" . When Germany turned East and invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , he again played a key part , making modifications to the original plan . Like his friend and colleague , Wilhelm Keitel , Brauchitsch did not protest when Hitler gave the German army the same instructions as the SS on who to kill in the occupied territory , but he later issued a series of decrees that ordered that Commissars were to be shot only if their anti-German sentiments were \" especially recognizable \" . As the Battle of Moscow got underway , his health was starting to fail . Even so , he continued his work , as he was determined to take Moscow before the start of the severe Russian winter . The army 's failure to take Moscow earned Hitler 's enmity , and things worsened for him , as he endured a serious heart attack in November . He was also informed that he had a malignant cardiac disease , most likely incurable . Like other generals in the aftermath of the failure at Moscow , Brauchitsch was made a scapegoat . He was dismissed as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on 19 December and was transferred to the F\u00fchrerreserve ( officers reserve ) , where he remained without assignment until the end of the war ; he never saw Hitler again . Brauchitsch spent the last three years of the war in the T\u0159i Trubky hunting lodge in the Brdy mountains southwest of Prague . One of his few public comments after retirement was a statement condemning the 20 July plot against Hitler for which he denounced several former colleagues . Later , he excused himself to Halder , claiming he had been forced to do so to save a relative 's life . = = = Trial and death = = = After the war , in August 1945 , Brauchitsch was arrested at his estate and imprisoned at Camp 198 in South Wales . His war crime charges included conspiracy and crimes against humanity . He died on 18 October 1948 of bronchial pneumonia in a British-controlled military hospital in Hamburg , aged 67 , before he could be prosecuted . He was buried at Salzgitter cemetery , Lower Saxony , Germany . = = Personal life = = In 1910 , Brauchitsch married his first wife , Elizabeth von Karstedt , a wealthy heiress to 300,000 acres ( 1,200 km2 ) in Brandenburg . The couple had two sons and a daughter , including Bernd von Brauchitsch , who later served in the Luftwaffe during World War II as Hermann G\u00f6ring 's adjutant . They were divorced in 1938 after 28 years of marriage , as Brauchitsch had developed another romantic interest . In 1925 , Brauchitsch met Charlotte Rueffer , the daughter of a Silesian judge . He wanted a divorce , but his wife refused . Rueffer later married a bank director named Schmidt , who drowned in his bath during a visit to Berlin . When Brauchitsch returned from East Prussia in 1937 , the pair resumed their affair . They married immediately after Brauchitsch had divorced Karstedt . Brauchitsch was the uncle of Manfred von Brauchitsch , a 1930s Mercedes-Benz \" Silver Arrow \" Grand Prix driver , and also Hans Bernd von Haeften and Werner von Haeften , who were members of the German resistance against Hitler . = = Assessment = = Historian Helmut Krausnick characterizes Brauchitsch as \" an outstanding professional who lived up to the traditions of his profession , but especially lacked the strength of personality to deal with Hitler \" . Historian Ian Kershaw on the other hand regards Brauchitsch as a \" spineless individual , who was frightened by Hitler . He was no person to lead any type of front or revolt . \" = = Awards = = Iron Cross ( 1914 ) 2nd Class ( 13 September 1914 ) 1st Class ( 1 October 1915 ) W\u00fcrttemberg Friedrich Order with Swords ( 7 May 1915 ) Knight 's Cross of the House Order of Hohenzollern with Swords ( 15 May 1917 ) Saxe-Meiningen Honour Cross for War Merit ( 2 January 1918 ) Service Award for 25 service years ( 17 April 1920 ) The Honour Cross of the World War 1914 / 1918 ( 18 December 1934 ) Wehrmacht Long Service Award 1st Class ( 2 October 1936 ) Royal Hungarian Order of Merit 1st Class ( 20 August 1938 ) Star of the German Red Cross Decoration ( 5 September 1938 ) Anschluss Medal ( 21 November 1938 ) Grand Cross of the Royal Italian Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus ( 3 January 1939 ) Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland ( 10 March 1939 ) Order of the Yugoslav Crown 1st Class ( 1 June 1939 ) Sudetenland Medal with Clasp ( 7 June 1939 ) Clasp to the Iron Cross ( 1939 ) 2nd Class ( 30 September 1939 ) 1st Class ( 30 September 1939 ) Knights Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 September 1939 as Colonel General and Commander-in-Chief of the Army Memel Medal ( 30 November 1939 ) Spanish Military Merit Cross 1st Class ( 1939 ) Grand Cross of the Royal Bulgarian Order of St Alexander with Swords ( 15 May 1941 ) Grand Cross of the Royal Hungarian Order of Merit with Swords ( 31 May 1941 ) Grand Cross of the Romanian Order of Michael the Brave ( 11 October 1941 ) Slovak War Victory Cross 1st Class ( 20 October 1941 ) Grand Cross of the Finnish Order of the Cross of Liberty ( 19 July 1942 ) Japanese Order of the Rising Sun 1st Class ( 26 September 1942 ) = = Dates of rank = = Leutnant ( Second Lieutenant ) \u2013 22 March 1900 Oberleutnant ( First Lieutenant ) \u2013 18 October 1909 Hauptmann ( Captain ) \u2013 18 December 1913 Major ( Major ) \u2013 15 July 1918 Oberstleutnant ( Lieutenant Colonel ) \u2013 1 June 1923 Oberst ( Colonel ) \u2013 1 April 1928 Generalmajor ( Major General ) \u2013 1 October 1931 Generalleutnant ( Lieutenant General ) \u2013 1 October 1933 General der Artillerie ( General of Artillery ) \u2013 1 October 1935 Generaloberst ( Colonel General ) \u2013 4 February 1938 Generalfeldmarschall ( Field Marshal ) \u2013 19 July 1940",

                    "text": "Frederick Browning = Lieutenant General Sir Frederick Arthur Montague \" Boy \" Browning , GCVO , KBE , CB , DSO ( 20 December 1896 \u2013 14 March 1965 ) was a senior officer of the British Army who has been called the \" father of the British airborne forces \" . He was the commander of I Airborne Corps and deputy commander of First Allied Airborne Army during Operation Market Garden in September 1944 . During the planning for this operation he memorably said : \" I think we might be going a bridge too far . \" He was also an Olympic bobsleigh competitor , and the husband of author Dame Daphne du Maurier . Educated at Eton College and then at the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , Browning was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards in 1915 . During the First World War he fought on the Western Front , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for conspicuous gallantry during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 . In September 1918 , he became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson . After the war , he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in which his team finished tenth . He married Daphne du Maurier in July 1932 . During the Second World War , Browning commanded the 1st Airborne Division and I Airborne Corps . He led the latter during Operation Market Garden , travelling by glider to participate in the assault . In December 1944 he became Chief of Staff of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten 's South East Asia Command . From September 1946 to January 1948 , he was Military Secretary of the War Office . In January 1948 , Browning became Comptroller and Treasurer to Her Royal Highness Princess Elizabeth , Duchess of Edinburgh . After she ascended to the throne to become Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 , he became treasurer in the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh . He suffered a severe nervous breakdown in 1957 and retired in 1959 . He died at Menabilly , the mansion that inspired his wife 's novel Rebecca , on 14 March 1965 . = = Early life = = Frederick Arthur Montague Browning was born on 20 December 1896 at his family home in Kensington , London . The house was later demolished to make way for an expansion of Harrods , allowing him to claim in later life that he had been born in its piano department . He was the first son of Frederick Henry Browning , a wine merchant , and his wife Nancy ( n\u00e9e Alt ) . He had one sibling , his older sister Helen Grace . From an early age he was known to his family as \" Tommy \" . He was educated at West Downs School and Eton College , which his grandfather had attended . While at Eton , he joined the Officer Training Corps . = = First World War = = Browning sat the entrance examinations for the Royal Military College , Sandhurst , on 24 November 1914 . Although he did not achieve the necessary scores in all the required subjects , the headmasters of some schools , including Eton , were in a position to recommend students for nomination by the Army Council . The head master of Eton , Edward Lyttelton , put Browning 's name forward and in this way he entered Sandhurst on 27 December 1914 . He graduated on 16 June 1915 , and was commissioned a second lieutenant into the Grenadier Guards . Joining such an exclusive regiment , even in wartime , required a personal introduction and an interview by the regimental commander , Colonel Sir Henry Streatfield . Initially , Browning joined the 4th Battalion , Grenadier Guards , which was training at Bovington Camp . When it departed for the Western Front in August 1915 , he was transferred to the 5th ( Reserve ) Battalion . In October 1915 he left to join the 2nd Battalion at the front . Around this time he acquired the nickname \" Boy \" . For a time he served in the same company of 2nd Battalion as Major Winston Churchill . Upon Churchill 's arrival , Browning was given the job of showing him the company 's trenches . When Browning discovered that Churchill had no greatcoat , Browning gave Churchill his own . Browning was invalided back to England with trench fever in January 1916 , and , although only hospitalised for four weeks , did not rejoin the 2nd Battalion at the front until 6 October 1916 . Browning participated in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July , the Battle of Poelcappelle on 9 October and the Battle of Cambrai in November . He distinguished himself in this battle , for which he received the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . The order was generally given to officers in command , above the rank of captain . When a junior officer like Browning , who was still only a lieutenant , was awarded the DSO , this was often regarded as an acknowledgement that the officer had only just missed out on the award of the Victoria Cross . His citation read : For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty . He took command of three companies whose officers had all become casualties , reorganised them , and proceeded to consolidate . Exposing himself to very heavy machine-gun and rifle fire , in two hours he had placed the front line in a strong state of defence . The conduct of this officer , both in the assault and more especially afterwards , was beyond all praise , and the successful handing over of the front to the relieving unit as an entrenched and strongly fortified position was entirely due to his energy and skill . He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre on 14 December 1917 , and mentioned in despatches on 23 May 1918 . In September 1918 , Browning became aide de camp to General Sir Henry Rawlinson , after which he returned to his regiment . He was promoted to the temporary rank of captain , and appointed adjutant of the 1st Battalion , Grenadier Guards , in November 1918 . = = Inter-war period = = Browning was granted the substantive rank of captain on 24 November 1920 . He retained his post as adjutant until November 1921 , when he was posted to the Guards ' Depot in Caterham . In 1924 he was posted to Sandhurst as adjutant . He was the first adjutant , during the Sovereign 's Parade of 1926 , to ride his horse ( named \" The Vicar \" ) up the steps of Old College and to dismount in the Grand Entrance . There is no satisfactory explanation as to why he did it . After the Second World War this became an enduring tradition , but since horses have great difficulty going down steps , a ramp is now provided for the horse to return . Other members of staff at Sandhurst at the time included Richard O 'Connor , Miles Dempsey , Douglas Gracey , and Eric Dorman-Smith , with whom he became close friends . Browning relinquished the appointment of adjutant at Sandhurst on 28 April 1928 , and was promoted to major on 22 May 1928 . Following a pattern whereby tours of duty away from the regiment alternated with those in it , he was sent for a refresher course at the Small Arms School before being posted to the 2nd Battalion , Grenadier Guards , at Pirbright . His workload was very light , allowing plenty of time for sports . Browning competed in the Amateur Athletic Association of England championships in hurdling but failed to make Olympic selection . He did however make the Olympic five-man bobsleigh team as brake-man . An injury incurred during a training accident prevented his participation in the bobsleigh at the 1924 Winter Olympics , but he competed in the bobsleigh at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz , Switzerland , in which his team finished tenth . Browning was also a keen sailor , competing in the Household Cavalry Sailing Regatta at Chichester Harbour in 1930 . He purchased his own motor boat , a 20-foot ( 6.1 m ) cabin cruiser that he named Ygdrasil . In 1931 , Browning read Daphne du Maurier 's novel The Loving Spirit and , impressed by its graphic depictions of the Cornish coastline , set out to see it for himself in Ygdrasil . Afterwards , he left the boat moored in the River Fowey for the winter , but returned in April 1932 to collect it . He heard that the author of the book that had impressed him so much was convalescing from an appendix operation , and invited her out on his boat . After a short romance , he proposed to her but she rejected this , as she did not believe in marriage . Dorman-Smith then went to see her and explained that their living together without marriage would be disastrous for Browning 's career . Du Maurier then proposed to Browning , who accepted . They were married in a simple ceremony at the Church of St Willow , Lanteglos-by-Fowey on 19 July 1932 , and honeymooned on Ygdrasil . Their marriage produced three children : two daughters , Tessa and Flavia , and a son , Christian , known as Kits . Browning was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 1 February 1936 , and was appointed commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion , Grenadier Guards . The battalion was deployed to Egypt in 1936 and returned in December 1937 . His term as commander ended on 1 August 1939 ; he was removed from the Grenadier Guards ' regimental list but remained on full pay . On 1 September , he was promoted to colonel , with his seniority backdated to 1 February 1939 , and became Commandant of the Small Arms School . = = Second World War = = = = = Airborne troops = = = In mid-May 1940 , Browning was given command of the 128th ( Hampshire ) Infantry Brigade ( consisting of three battalions of the Hampshire Regiment ) with the rank of brigadier . Part of the 43rd ( Wessex ) Infantry Division , the 128th Brigade was a Territorial Army brigade that was preparing to join the British Expeditionary Force in France . This was pre-empted by the Fall of France in June 1940 , and the division assumed a defensive posture . In February 1941 , Browning became commander of the 24th Guards Brigade Group , whose mission was to defend London from an attack from the south . On 3 November 1941 , Browning was promoted to major-general , and appointed commander of the 1st Airborne Division . In this new role he was instrumental in parachutists adopting the maroon beret , and assigned an artist , Major Edward Seago , to design the Parachute Regiment 's now famous emblem of the warrior Bellerophon riding Pegasus , the winged horse . However , Browning \" designed his own uniform , made of barathea with a false Uhlan-style front , incorporating a zip opening at the neck to reveal regulation shirt and tie , worn with medal ribbons , collar patches , and rank badges , capped off with grey kid gloves , and a highly polished Guards Sam Browne belt and swagger stick \" , all of which were worn in the field . He qualified as a pilot in 1942 , and henceforth wore the Army Air Corps wings , which he also designed himself . Browning supervised the newly formed division as it underwent a prolonged period of expansion and intensive training , with new brigades raised and assigned to the division , and new equipment tested . Though not considered an airborne warfare visionary , he proved adept at dealing with an apathetic War Office and an obstructionist Air Ministry , and demonstrated a knack for overcoming bureaucratic obstacles . As the airborne forces expanded in size , the major difficulty in getting the 1st Airborne Division ready for operations was a shortage of aircraft . The Royal Air Force had neglected air transport before the war , and the only available aircraft for airborne troops were conversions of obsolete bombers like the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley . Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris in particular felt that the 1st Airborne Division was not worth the drain on Bomber Command 's resources . When Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the United States Army Chief of Staff , General George C. Marshall , visited the 1st Airborne Division on 16 April 1942 , they were treated to a demonstration involving every available aircraft of No. 38 Wing RAF \u2014 12 Whitleys and nine Hawker Hector biplanes towing General Aircraft Hotspur gliders . At a meeting on 6 May chaired by Churchill , Browning was asked what he required . He stated that he needed 96 aircraft to get the 1st Airborne Division battle-ready . Churchill directed Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal to find the required aircraft , and Portal agreed to supply 83 Whitleys , along with 10 Halifax bombers to tow the new , larger General Aircraft Hamilcar gliders . In July 1942 , Browning travelled to the United States , where he toured airborne training facilities with his American counterpart , Major General William C. Lee . Browning 's tendency to lecture the Americans on airborne warfare made him few friends among the Americans , who felt that the British were still novices themselves . Browning was envious of the Americans ' equipment , particularly the C-47 Dakota transports . On returning to the United Kingdom , he arranged for a joint exercise to be conducted with the 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry . In mid \u2013 September , as the 1st Airborne Division was coming close to reaching full strength , Browning was informed that Operation Torch , the Allied invasion of North Africa , would take place in November . When he found that the 2nd Battalion , 503rd Parachute Infantry , was to take part , Browning argued that a larger airborne force should be utilised , as the vast distances and comparatively light opposition would provide opportunities for airborne operations . The War Office and the Commander-in-Chief , Home Forces , General Sir Bernard Paget , were won over by Browning 's arguments , and agreed to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from 1st Airborne Division and place it under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who would command all Allied troops participating in the invasion . After it had been brought to full operational strength , partly by cross-posting personnel from the newly formed 2nd Parachute Brigade , and had been provided with sufficient equipment and resources , the brigade departed for North Africa at the beginning of November . The results of British airborne operations in North Africa were mixed , and the subject of a detailed report by Browning . The airborne troops had operated under several handicaps , including shortages of photographs and maps . All the troop carrier aircrew were American , who lacked familiarity with airborne operations and in dealing with British troops and equipment . Browning felt that the inexperience with handling airborne operations extended to Eisenhower 's Allied Forces Headquarters ( AFHQ ) and that of the British First Army , resulting in the paratroops being misused . He felt that had they been employed more aggressively and in greater strength they might have shortened the Tunisia Campaign by some months . The 1st Parachute Brigade had been called the \" Rote Teufel \" or \" Red Devils \" by the German troops they had fought . Browning pointed out to the brigade that this was an honour , as \" distinctions given by the enemy are seldom won in battle except by the finest fighting troops . \" The title was officially confirmed by General Sir Harold Alexander and henceforth applied to all British airborne troops . On 1 January 1943 , Browning was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath . He relinquished command of the 1st Airborne Division in March 1943 to take up a new post as major-general , Airborne Forces at Eisenhower 's AFHQ . He soon clashed with the commander of the US 82nd Airborne Division , Major General Matthew Ridgway . When Browning asked to see the plans for Operation Husky , the Allied invasion of Sicily , Ridgway replied that they would not be available for scrutiny until after they had been approved by the U.S. Seventh Army commander , Lieutenant General George Patton . When Browning protested , Patton backed Ridgway , but Eisenhower and his chief of staff , Major General Walter Bedell Smith , supported Browning and forced them to back down . Browning 's dealings with the British Army were no smoother . His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division , Major-General George F. Hopkinson , had sold the commander of the British Eighth Army , General Sir Bernard Montgomery , on Operation Ladbroke , a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse . Browning 's objections to the operation were ignored , and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion had to go through him . Browning concluded that to be effective , the airborne advisor had to have equal rank with the army commanders . In September 1943 , Browning travelled to India , where he inspected the 50th Parachute Brigade , and met with Major-General Orde Wingate , the commander of the Chindits , an airborne special force . Browning held a series of meetings with General Sir Claude Auchinleck , the Commander-in-Chief , India ; Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Peirse , the Air Officer Commander-in-Chief ; and Lieutenant-General Sir George Giffard , the General Officer Commanding Eastern Army . They discussed plans for improving the airborne establishment in India and expanding the airborne force there to a division . As a result of these discussions , and Browning 's subsequent report to the War Office , the 44th Indian Airborne Division was formed in October 1944 . Browning sent his most experienced airborne commander , Major-General Ernest Down , to India to command it . Down 's replacement as commander of the 1st Airborne Division by Montgomery 's selection , Major-General Roy Urquhart , an officer with no airborne experience , rather than Browning 's choice , Brigadier Gerald Lathbury of the 1st Parachute Brigade , would become controversial . Some saw him as \" a ruthless and manipulative empire builder who brooked no opposition \" . Brigadier-General James M. Gavin , assistant division commander of the 82nd Airborne Division , recalled that when he travelled to England in November 1943 , Ridgway \" cautioned me against the machinations and scheming of General F. M. Browning , who was the senior British airborne officer , and well he should have . \" Major-General Ray Barker told him that Browning was \" an empire builder \" , an assessment that Gavin came to agree with . = = = Operation Market Garden = = = Browning assumed a new command on 4 December 1943 . His Directive No. 1 announced that \" the title of the force is Headquarters , Airborne Troops ( 21st Army Group ) . All correspondence will bear the official title , but verbally it will be known as the Airborne Corps and I will be referred to as the Corps Commander . \" He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 7 January 1944 , with his seniority backdated to 9 December 1943 . He officially became commander of I Airborne Corps on 16 April 1944 . I Airborne Corps became part of the First Allied Airborne Army , commanded by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton , in August 1944 . While retaining command of the corps , Browning also became Deputy Commander of the Army , despite a poor relationship with Brereton and being disliked by many American officers , including Major General Ridgway , now commander of the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps . During preparations for one of many cancelled operations , Linnete II , his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation , which , due to differences in military culture , Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order . Browning was forced into a humiliating backdown . When I Airborne Corps was committed to action in Operation Market Garden in September 1944 , Browning 's rift with Brereton had severe repercussions . Browning was concerned about the timetable put forward by Major-General Paul L. Williams of the IX Troop Carrier Command , under which the drop was staggered over several days , and not to make two drops on the first day . This restricted the number of combat troops available on the first day . He also disagreed with the British drop zones proposed by Air Vice Marshal Leslie Hollinghurst of No. 38 Group RAF , which he felt were too distant from the bridge at Arnhem , but Browning now felt unable to challenge the airmen . Browning downplayed evidence brought to him by his intelligence officer , Major Brian Urquhart , that the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and the 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg were in the Arnhem area , but was not as confident as he led his subordinates to believe . According to Major-General Urquhart , commander of the British 1st Airborne , when informed that his airborne troops would have to hold the bridge for two days , Browning responded that they could hold it for four , but then added : \" But I think we might be going a bridge too far . \" 'Boy ' Browning landed by gliders with a tactical headquarters near Nijmegen . His use of 38 aircraft to move his corps headquarters on the first lift has been criticised . Half of these gliders carried signal equipment but for much of the operation he had no contact with either the British 1st Airborne Division at Arnhem or Major General Taylor 's U.S. 101st Airborne Division at Eindhoven . His headquarters had not been envisaged as a frontline unit , and the signals section that had been hastily assembled just weeks before lacked training and experience . In his pack , Browning carried three teddy bears and a framed print of Albrecht D\u00fcrer 's The Praying Hands . Major General Gavin , now commanding the 82nd Airborne Division , was critical of Browning , writing in his diary on 6 September 1944 that he \" ... unquestionably lacks the standing , influence and judgement that comes from a proper troop experience .... his staff was superficial ... Why the British units fumble along ... becomes more and more apparent . Their tops lack the know-how , never do they get down into the dirt and learn the hard way . \" After the war , Gavin and his staff were criticised for the decision to secure the high ground around Groesbeek before attempting the capture of the Waal bridge at Nijmegen . Browning took responsibility for this , noting that he \" personally gave an order to Jim Gavin that , although every effort should be made to effect the capture of the Grave and Nijmegen bridges as soon as possible , it was essential that he should capture the Groesbeek Ridge and hold it \" . After the battle , Browning was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta ( II class ) by the Polish government-in-exile , but his critical evaluation of the contribution of Polish forces led to the removal of Major-General Stanis\u0142aw Sosabowski as commanding officer of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade . Some writers later claimed that Sosabowski had been made a scapegoat for the failure of Market Garden . Field Marshal Montgomery attached no blame to Browning or any of his subordinates , or indeed acknowledged failure at all . He told the Chief of the Imperial General Staff , Sir Alan Brooke , that he would like Browning to take over VIII Corps in the event that Richard O 'Connor were transferred to another theatre . = = = South East Asia Command = = = Events took a different course . Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten , the Supreme Allied Commander , South East Asia Command ( SEAC ) , had need of a new chief of staff owing to the poor health of Lieutenant-General Henry Royds Pownall . Brooke turned down Mountbatten 's initial request for either Lieutenant-General Archibald Nye or Lieutenant-General John Swayne . Brooke then offered Browning for the post , and Mountbatten accepted . Pownall considered that Browning was \" excellently qualified \" for the post , although he had no staff college training and had never held a staff job before . Pownall noted that his \" only reservation is that I believe [ Browning ] is rather nervy and highly strung \" . For his services as a corps commander , Browning was mentioned in despatches a second time , and was awarded the Legion of Merit in the degree of Commander by the United States government . Browning served in South East Asia from December 1944 until July 1946 ; Mountbatten soon came to regard him as indispensable . Browning had an American deputy , Major-General Horace H. Fuller , and brought staff with him from Europe to SEAC headquarters in Kandy , Ceylon . SEAC headquarters developed an adversarial relationship with that of Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese 's Allied Land Forces South East Asia ( ALFSEA ) . Matters came to a head when Leese attempted to replace the victorious commander of the Fourteenth Army , Lieutenant-General Sir William Slim . In the resulting furore , Leese was relieved instead . Slim took over ALFSEA and was replaced as Fourteenth Army commander by Browning 's friend General Sir Miles Dempsey . For his services at SEAC , Browning was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 1 January 1946 . His last major military post was as Military Secretary of the War Office from September 1946 to January 1948 . = = Later life = = In January 1948 , Browning became Comptroller and Treasurer to Her Royal Highness the Princess Elizabeth Duchess of Edinburgh , although he did not officially retire from the Army until 5 April 1948 . This appointment was made on the recommendation of Lord Mountbatten , whose nephew Philip Mountbatten was now the Duke of Edinburgh . As such , Browning became the head of the Princess ' personal staff . He also juggled other duties . In 1948 he was involved with the 1948 Summer Olympics as Deputy Chairman of the British Olympic Association , and commandant of the British team . From 1944 to 1962 he was Commodore of the Royal Fowey Yacht Club ; on stepping down in 1962 , he was elected its first Admiral . Upon the death of King George VI in 1952 , the Duchess of Edinburgh inherited the throne as Queen Elizabeth II . Browning and his staff became redundant , as the Queen was now served by the large staff of the monarch . The domestic staff remained at Clarence House , where they continued to serve the Queen Mother . The remainder were reorganised as the Office of the Duke of Edinburgh , with Browning as treasurer , the head of the office , moving into a new and larger office at Buckingham Palace . Like the Duke they served , the office had no constitutional role , but followed his sporting , cultural and scientific interests . Browning became involved with the Cutty Sark Trust , set up to preserve the famous ship , and in the administration of the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award . In June 1953 , Browning and Du Maurier attended the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II . Browning had been drinking since the war , but it had now become chronic . This led to a severe nervous breakdown in July 1957 , forcing his resignation from his position at the Palace in 1959 . Du Maurier had known of his taking a mistress in Fowey , but his breakdown brought to light two other girlfriends in London . For her part , Du Maurier confessed to her own wartime affair . For his services to the Royal Household , Browning was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1953 , and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1959 . He retreated to Menabilly , the mansion that had inspired Du Maurier 's novel Rebecca , which she had leased and restored in 1943 . In 1960 he was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of Cornwall . Browning caused a scandal in 1963 when , under the influence of prescription drugs and alcohol , he was involved in an automobile accident in which two people were injured . He was fined \u00a3 50 and forced to pay court and medical costs . He died from a heart attack at Menabilly on 14 March 1965 . = = Legacy = = Browning was portrayed by Dirk Bogarde in the film A Bridge Too Far , based on the events of Operation Market Garden . A copy of Browning 's uniform was made to Bogarde 's measurements from the original in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum . The Airborne Forces Museum , which opened in 1969 , was for many years located in Browning Barracks , which had been built in 1964 and named after Browning . Browning Barracks remained the depot of the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces until 1993 . The museum moved to the Imperial War Museum Duxford in 2008 , and Browning Barracks was sold for housing development .",

Following graduation from Boston University , Juskalian entered the army as a second lieutenant in June 1936 . During World War II , he served with the infantry during the North African Campaign and took part in Operation Torch . At the Battle of the Kasserine Pass , he was captured by German troops and became a prisoner of war ( POW ) for twenty-seven months . During the Korean War he commanded an infantry battalion . He was then stationed in Tehran where he acted an advisor to the Imperial Iranian Army throughout 1957 and 1958 . During the Vietnam War , Juskalian once again undertook advisory duties , working with the South Vietnamese Army between 1963 and 1964 , before serving as the MACV inspector general under General William Westmoreland . Juskalian retired as a colonel in 1967 and is one of the most decorated Armenian-Americans to serve in the United States Army . His awards include two Combat Infantryman Badges , two Silver Stars , the Legion of Merit , four Bronze Stars and the Air Medal . He received the Nerses Shnorali Medal from the Catholicos of All Armenians in 1988 . The post office in his home town of Centreville , Virginia , has been named the \" Colonel George Juskalian Post Office Building \" in his honor . = = Early life = = George Juskalian was born in Fitchburg , Massachusetts on June 7 , 1914 , the youngest son of Armenian parents Kevork Juskalian ( 1861 \u2013 1938 ) and Maritza Ferrahian ( 1876 \u2013 1960 ) . George 's father , Kevork , was from Kharpert , Ottoman Turkey , and his mother Maritza was from Arapkir , Ottoman Turkey . Kevork Juskalian was among the earliest graduates of the Euphrates College in Kharpert , completing his studies around 1881 . He served as a minor official of the local Turkish government in Mezire , a village near Kharpert . He was then invited to work in the Persian consulate in Mezire until he was recalled by the Turkish government to serve as supervisor of eleven villages in the region of Kharpert . Kevork Juskalian felt that there was no secure future for him in Ottoman Turkey and subsequently fled to the United States with his family , arriving at Ellis Island on November 15 , 1887 . Consequently , the Juskalian family became some of the first Armenians to come to the United States . Kevork found a job at the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works in Worcester , Massachusetts . He was instrumental in the establishment of the Armenian Church of Our Savior on January 18 , 1891 . In 1893 , Kevork returned to Kharpert and married Maritza Ferrahian , daughter of Krikor and Yeghisapet ( Yesayan ) Ferrahian . Due to the Hamidian Massacres , Kevork and Maritza returned to the United States and Kevork rejoined the Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works company . Juskalian , who grew up in Fitchburg , attended the local schools and graduated from Fitchburg High School in 1932 . He continued his education at Boston University , graduating in 1936 with a bachelor 's degree in science , journalism . = = Military service = = While studying at Boston University , Juskalian undertook military training as part of the Reserve Officers Training Corps . On graduation , he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army , and in June 1936 , was assigned as an administrative officer of a Civilian Conservation Corps camp at Brewster , Massachusetts , where he helped build a national park . After leaving active service , Juskalian had intended to study law at the American University in Washington , D.C. , but when his father died in 1938 , he gave up this plan and returned to Fitchburg to reunite with his mother and assist his brother-in-law 's dry-cleaning business . That year , after passing a government exam , Juskalian became a fingerprint classifier for the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , and took part in the search for John Dillinger , who was on the \" Top 10 Most Wanted \" list . He then volunteered for active service in 1939 . Juskalian was called to active duty at Fort Devens , Massachusetts , and was promoted to the rank as first lieutenant in November 1940 . Juskalian was given command of a 200-man company after the reorganization of the 1st Infantry Division . In February 1942 , Juskalian was promoted to captain and was sent to Camp Blanding , Florida , before moving to Fort Benning , Georgia and then Indiantown Gap Military Reservation , Pennsylvania , for additional training and combat readiness evaluation . In August 1942 , Juskalian boarded the RMS Queen Mary , and along with the other 15,000 soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division , was shipped to Europe . = = = World War II = = = = = = = North African Campaign = = = = The soldiers of the 1st Infantry Division are believed to be among the first American troops shipped out to the European theater during the war . The division landed near Glasgow , Scotland , then proceeded to a British Army base near London to continue training . Juskalian , who became the assistant plans and operations officer on the regimental staff , went to Inveraray , Scotland , to train for the North African Campaign . Juskalian then took part in Operation Torch as part of the 1st Infantry Division 's 26th Infantry Regiment , commanded by Theodore Roosevelt Jr . The Allies , who had organized three amphibious task forces , aimed to seize key ports and airfields in Morocco and Algeria while simultaneously targeting Casablanca , Oran and Algiers . Juskalian 's unit was part of the task force that invaded through the port of Oran . Landing in Oran on November 8 , 1942 , the 1st Infantry Division 's primary objective was to confront the German Afrika Korps commanded by Erwin Rommel , while its secondary objective was to support Bernard Law Montgomery 's advance against the Italian forces . Eventually , the 1st Infantry Division broke through the German resistance and scaled Mount Djebel . Oran fell to the Allies on November 10 and Juskalian 's unit advanced east into Tunisia , reaching the Algeria \u2013 Tunisia border by January 15 , 1943 . There , the task force met resistance from German and Italian troops . = = = = German prisoner of war = = = = As the fighting continued into the Makthar Valley , Juskalian was assigned to the 26th Infantry Regiment 's headquarters . When attempting to save the life of a fellow soldier following heavy fighting , he was captured by German troops at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia on January 28 . Juskalian described his capture as follows : \" One of our intelligence officers had gone out to check on the situation , and word came back that he 'd been wounded and was out there somewhere . So another officer and I went out in a Jeep and found him , but he was dead . Then we came under fire , so we couldn 't drag him out of there . \" After telling the driver to return to the command post , Juskalian investigated the conditions of the other U.S. soldiers . \" I thought they were all right because we hadn 't heard anything from them , but they 'd been overrun by the Germans . \" Having lost his glasses , Juskalian could not distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50 feet ( 15 m ) away . The soldiers were Germans and took him prisoner . Juskalian said about his capture , \" I was irritated with myself for being so foolhardy , I shouldn 't have been there . \" Juskalian later learned , while still a prisoner of war ( POW ) , that he had been awarded the Silver Star for his rescue attempt . After his first two days of being a POW , he was promoted to major . = = = = = Oflag IX-A / Z in Rotenburg , Germany = = = = = Juskalian spent the next twenty-seven months as a POW and was held in various camps in Italy , Poland and Germany . After being interrogated in Kairouan , he was sent to Tunis and flown to Naples . The planes flew at a low altitude as Juskalian described : \" They flew about 100 feet above the Mediterranean because they were afraid that , if they flew higher , the American fighter planes \u2014 not knowing POWs were inside \u2014 would see us and shoot us down . \" The POWs were sent to Oflag IX-A / Z British POW camp in Rotenburg an der Fulda where they remained until June 6 , 1943 , when they were transferred to Oflag 64 in Szubin , Poland . The British POWs provided the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing sent by the British Red Cross . The British , who were in the process of digging an escape tunnel , requested help from the Americans . Juskalian would later describe the operation : \" I volunteered , although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank . When I look back at it , I wonder how I did it . Some nights when I think about it , I break out in a cold sweat . Somehow , I was able to summon up the will to do it . The tunnel was already some 80 to 100 feet long . It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence , but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River . In that way when the tunnel was broken open , the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers . \" The tunnel was about 3 feet ( 1 m ) high by 3 feet ( 1 m ) wide . Lighting in the tunnel was provided by makeshift candles . The prisoners used improvised digging tools and shovels that were constructed from British biscuit cans and their handles made from the wooden slats of their beds . The tins were also used to create a pipe for fresh air to funnel through the tunnel with the assistance of a hand-cranked fan at the entrance of the tunnel . A sled , made of wooden slats with a tine base to make it slide easily over the earthen tunnel floor , was used to haul the sandbags . Juskalian described the method that was used to dispose the sand : \" The method used to conceal the sand was ingenious . The sand was poured into burlap bags made surreptitiously from Red Cross parcel wrappings then passed rapidly along a makeshift fire brigade line through the building and up into the attic . There it was dumped between the outer and inner walls where there was a wide space for insulation . Literally tons of sand could be disposed of there before the space would be filled . \" Before the tunnel had been completed , the American POWs were transferred to Oflag 64 in Szubin , Poland . Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100 feet , it would reach its destination at the bank of the Fulda River . Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape . The two Americans , who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64 , relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs . = = = = = Oflag 64 in Szubin , Poland = = = = = Juskalian spent nineteen-and-a-half of his twenty-seven months imprisonment in Oflag 64 . The POWs in the camp undertook various leisure activities including staging plays , playing music , reading , athletics , and learning languages . While there , Juskalian became an editor of a monthly newspaper that was published with the assistance of a guard who owned a local printing shop . The newspaper featured \" stories from home , cartoons , pictures of pin-up girls and girlfriends and articles about camp sports and activities \" . In June 1944 the American POWs held a party on the first anniversary of being in the camp . The party coincided with the Normandy landings , and the Germans suspected that the American POWs had purposely planned the party because they had prior knowledge of the Allied invasion . The commandant of Oflag 64 called higher headquarters for advice and assistance . Eventually the German Gestapo searched the Americans ' rooms for evidence of outside communication . However , Juskalian shared one of the cigars his brother-in-law , Hagop Chiknavorian , had given him , with the officer undertaking the search who soon became \" distracted and softened \" . = = = = = Oflag XIII B in Hammelburg , Germany = = = = = On January 21 , 1945 , the German troops and their POWs moved westward into Germany to avoid the Soviet advance from the east . Juskalian and other American POWs were transferred to Parchim , northeast of Berlin , on March 1 , 1945 . Over the course of 48 days , the POWs traveled 350 miles ( 560 km ) from Parchim to Oflag XIII-B in Hammelburg in box cars which , according to Juskalian , were \" packed like sardines . \" During his time in Hammelburg , Juskalian met another Armenian POW , Captain Peter Mirakian of Philadelphia . Together , the two Armenian Americans discovered that one of the Soviet POWs was also an Armenian . Mirakian and Juskalian surreptitiously gave him food from their limited rations . The camp at Hammelburg held many American prisoners including George S. Patton 's son-in-law , Lieutenant Colonel John K. Waters . Attempting to rescue Waters , a military task force from the 4th Armored Division was sent to liberate the camp . When the task force arrived , the German guards fled the camp , but the task force did not have enough vehicles to evacuate all POWs in the camp . Mirakian and Juskalian escaped through an opening in the compound fence and ran towards Frankfurt hoping to reach the American lines there , but a German patrol captured them , and they were immediately sent to Nuremberg . Juskalian later remarked : \" We were tired and depressed but thankful to be alive . \" While Juskalian was held in Nuremberg , the Americans began their bombardment of the city . He describes the moment in his own words : \" We were cheering , and our guards were getting irritated , but the bombs came down on us , too , and I was sure we were going to get it . About 30 of us were killed . I was thinking of my mother and how ironic it would be to be killed at the end of the war \u2014 and by your own aircraft . \" After surviving the bombardment , the POWs were resettled in a camp near Munich . The Germans gave them the opportunity to return to Nuremberg as wounded soldiers to obtain treatment ; the POWs agreed because it was closer to the American lines . On April 17 , American troops secured Nuremberg and subsequently freed the POWs . Juskalian described the event : \" When the Germans tried to see if we were really wounded , the British erected a sign on the gate saying ' Plague ' , and that kept them out , three or four days later , the 45th U.S. Infantry Division overran Nuremberg and we were liberated . \" Juskalian was flown to Paris , France , where he presented himself at a military post and requested financial assistance . However , he did not have official identification and was refused . An officer , who knew George 's older brother Richard ( Dikran ) , who lived in Watertown , overheard him and recognized the last name Juskalian . George confirmed that Richard was his brother , and he was then given all the provisions he needed . = = = = Post World War II = = = = Upon returning to the United States after the war , Juskalian had an appointment with the regular army where he was ultimately promoted to lieutenant colonel . He reported to the Pentagon for duty in the Office of the Secretary of the Army Chief of Staff from 1945 \u2013 1948 . In the Pentagon , Juskalian was assigned as an assistant secretary in the Secretariat of the War Department and was a secretary to Dwight D. Eisenhower , the Chief of Staff of the Army . His responsibilities included supporting the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff of the British and Americans and preparing briefs for Eisenhower . After his tour of duty at the Pentagon , he attended the Army 's Command and General Staff College 's regular ten-month course at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , from 1948 to 1949 . His next assignment was with the staff and faculty of the Infantry School at Fort Benning , Georgia , where he remained from 1949 until the summer of 1952 . While at the school , he took airborne training and became a qualified parachutist . Juskalian was then assigned to Alaska as commandant of the Arctic Warfare School . Still embittered by the memory of having spent most of World War II as a POW , he requested his orders be changed from Alaska to Korea where United States forces were engaged in combat operations as part of the United Nations forces committed to Korean War . His request was approved and in the summer of 1952 he was sent to the combat zone . = = = Korean War = = = Juskalian was assigned as a battalion commander from 1952 to 1953 . In 1953 , he commanded the 1st Battalion , 32nd Infantry Regiment , 7th Infantry Division . In the final winter of the war the Chinese attempted to overcome the United Nations ' main line of resistance and capture a series of hills . Juskalian 's battalion was assigned to carry out a counterattack on a 300-foot high hill known as \" Old Baldy \" during an action that later became known as the Battle of Old Baldy . When the Chinese offensive came to a halt , Juskalian reorganized the forces under his command and sent both A and B Companies , under First Lieutenant Jack L. Conn , on a second attack to retake the hill , but they regained only a quarter of it . On March 25 Juskalian ordered C Company , under First Lieutenant Robert C. Gutner , to attack from the northeast , but enemy forces halted their advance . Many members of C Company were trapped on the right flank of Old Baldy , and Juskalian requested tank support to demolish the Chinese bunkers to free 30 to 40 troops of the company . On the night of March 26 , Juskalian received orders from Regimental Commander Colonel William B. Kern to withdraw his forces . To the east of Old Baldy heavy fighting took place around Pork Chop Hill , which was later made famous by the movie Pork Chop Hill starring actor Gregory Peck . The Chinese force grew and became numerically superior to the Americans , and Juskalian was ordered to withdraw . Due to his efforts and the successful withdrawal of troops , he was awarded a second Silver Star for gallantry . At the end of the war in June 1953 , he was transferred to the Eighth Army Headquarters in Seoul where he assisted in the prisoner of war exchange that took place at Panmunjom . = = = Missions in Iran , New York , and France = = = Juskalian was assigned as a logistics officer to the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group ( MAAG ) in Tehran , Iran in 1957 . He then became chief of the Training Division of the Iranian First Army and was promoted to full colonel . As principal logistics officer , Juskalian supervised the U.S. Army officers advising the Iranian Army general officers serving as technical service department chiefs . Additionally , his office was responsible for managing the annual input of U.S. military material and construction to the Iranian armed forces . During his time in Iran , Juskalian met many Armenians in Tehran , a number of whom he kept in touch with for the rest of his life . After his mission in Iran in 1957 \u2013 1958 , Juskalian visited Kharpert , his father 's birthplace . In an article he later wrote about the trip entitled \" Harput Revisited \" , which appeared in the April 1959 issue of the Armenian Review , Juskalian wrote : \" I tried in vain to locate my parents ' home . Mezireh , as a community , was alive and well . Harput ( Kharpert ) , on the other hand was dead , a bleak landscape of debris where once proudly stood a college , schools , churches , shops and homes . There was not even a grave over which to weep and pray for the souls of those from whom I came . \" After completing his duties in Iran , Juskalian assumed the role of chief of operations and training at the headquarters of the First Army that commanded all U.S. Army installations in New England , New York and New Jersey . His posting in New York was cut short by the Berlin Crisis of 1961 , and Juskalian was sent to France to join the 1st Logistical Command . When the 1st Logistical Command was merged with the 4th Logistical Command at Verdun , Juskalian was transferred to this command , serving as the G-3 chief of plans , operations and training . = = = Vietnam War = = = After his tours of duty in New York and France , Juskalian volunteered to fight in Vietnam in late spring of 1963 . He arrived in Saigon in August 1963 and took up a posting as deputy senior advisor to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 's IV Corps stationed in the Mekong Delta . After six months , Jukalian was assigned to the headquarters of Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( MACV ) to serve as the MACV inspector general under General William Westmoreland , the MACV commander . As part of his duties , he traveled throughout South Vietnam on inspection visits to many military installations . In the transient officers quarters at Danang , he found an ashtray from George Mardikian 's Omar Khayyam restaurant in San Francisco and kept it as a souvenir for the rest of his life . For his service in the Vietnam War , Juskalian was awarded an Air Medal and a Bronze Star . Juskalian returned to the United States in August 1964 and was posted to headquarters of Military District of Washington ( MDW ) as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Training , his last Army assignment before retirement . During his three years at MDW , he served as chairman of the Joint Military Executive Committee that was chiefly responsible for planning and carrying out all arrangements for the participation of military services in the inauguration of President Lyndon B. Johnson in January 1965 . = = Post-retirement from the army = = Juskalian retired from the army on April 30 , 1967 , and was awarded the Legion of Merit . After his retirement , he settled in Arlington , Virginia . Juskalian worked as the graduate admissions director at the Southeastern University in Washington D.C. for eight years and attained a master 's degree in business and public administration with honors in 1977 at the age of sixty . He was a member of many veterans ' organizations including the American Legion , the Veterans of Foreign Wars , the Disabled American Veterans , the American Ex-Prisoners of War , the Retired Officers Association , and the 1st Infantry Division Association for the Uniformed Services ( NAUS ) . He served for a term as first vice president of NAUS and was the commander of the Northern Virginia Chapter of the American Ex-Prisoners of War . In 1982 Juskalian was appointed for a three-year term to the Veterans Administration Advisory Committee for Former Prisoners of War . Whenever possible , he attended annual reunions with former Oflag 64 POWs and the annual national conventions of the American ex-POW organization . He was appointed to the Editorial Advisory Board of the newly established Washington Times daily newspaper in 1983 . = = = Community service = = = Juskalian was a prominent figure in the Armenian community . He served at the local St. Mary \u2019 s Armenian Apostolic Church and the Diocesan Council of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America . He served on the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America , and subsequently for a ten-year term on its Board of Trustees . He was also a member of the Armenian General Benevolent Union 's Central Committee of America and the Armenian Assembly of America . He helped organize a memorial service for Armenian American veterans at the Arlington National Cemetery on May 21 , 1978 , where the graves of forty-nine Armenian American veterans , spanning the period from the Spanish \u2013 American War to the Vietnam War , were decorated with carnations . Juskalian also volunteered in local schools . He continuously stressed the importance of public service and shared many of his experiences with students . = = Personal life = = On August 31 , 1951 , Juskalian married Beatrice MacDougall , the widow of Lieutenant Jack W. Kirk , one of his first company commanders . The marriage ended in divorce in 1958 . In 1970 , he married his second wife , Lucine Barsoumian , an Armenian from Aleppo , Syria . They had a son named Kevork and a daughter named Elissa . Kevork graduated from George Mason University in May 1996 with a master 's degree in international transactions and was later commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Regular Army . Gregory , a son by his previous marriage with Beatrice MacDougall , lives in Stockbridge , Massachusetts . George Juskalian was also the cousin of Medal of Honor recipient Ernest Dervishian who received the award while serving in the U.S. Army during World War II . After his second marriage , Juskalian and his wife visited many countries including Lebanon , Egypt , Italy , France , Spain and his homeland of Armenia . In 1989 , Juskalian along with his family moved to Centreville , Virginia , where he remained the rest of his life . Juskalian died on July 4 , 2010 ; funeral processions were held at the St. Mary 's Armenian Apostolic Church in Washington D.C. He is buried in the Prisoner of War Section of the Arlington National Cemetery . = = Recognition = = In 1988 Juskalian was awarded the St. Nerses Shnorhali Award and Lifetime Achievement and Pastor 's Recognition Award bestowed by Vasken I , Catholicos of All Armenians for his dedication to the Armenian community . Juskalian was featured in the documentary series Americans At War by the U.S. Naval Institute . Each episode of the documentary series features a U.S. veteran recounting a defining moment from his or her time in the armed services . During a ceremony marking the seventy-fourth anniversary of Washington 's Armenian community , Armenia 's ambassador to the United States Doctor Tatoul Markarian , expressed his appreciation of Colonel Juskalian 's many contributions to the Armenian community , and congratulated him for his lifetime achievements . On April 23 , 2007 , the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors recognized Juskalian for \" heroism and honorable service \" to the United States . Following Juskalian 's death on July 4 , 2010 , Virginia Senator Jim Webb wrote : \" It is my understanding that Colonel Juskalian was one of the most highly decorated Armenian-American Veterans to serve in the United States Army . I am sure his dedication to serving the Armenian-American community will be missed and his contribution will always be remembered . \" On May 21 , 2011 , President Barack Obama signed House Resolution 6392 of the 2nd Session of the 111th Congress which designated the post office on 5003 Westfields Boulevard in Centreville , Virginia , as the \" Colonel George Juskalian Post Office Building \" . The renaming ceremony was celebrated at the post office on the same day and was attended by friends , family , politicians , former POWs , veterans , and members of the Armenian community . Attendees included U.S. Congressman Frank Wolf , Virginia Delegate Jim LeMunyon and member of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Michael Frey .

                    "text": "George Kenney = George Churchill Kenney ( 6 August 1889 \u2013 9 August 1977 ) was a United States Army Air Forces general during World War II . He is best known as the commander of the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area ( SWPA ) , a position he held from August 1942 until 1945 . Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the Aviation Section , U.S. Signal Corps in 1917 , and served on the Western Front with the 91st Aero Squadron . He was awarded a Silver Star and the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in which he fought off German fighters and shot two down . After hostilities ended he participated in the Occupation of the Rhineland . Returning to the United States , he flew reconnaissance missions along the border between the US and Mexico during the Mexican Revolution . Commissioned into the Regular Army in 1920 , he attended the Air Corps Tactical School , and later became an instructor there . He was responsible for the acceptance of Martin NBS-1 bombers built by Curtis , and test flew them . He also developed techniques for mounting .30 caliber machine guns on the wings of an Airco DH.4 aircraft . In early 1940 , Kenney became Assistant Military Attach\u00e9 for Air in France . As a result of his observations of German and Allied air operations during the early stages of World War II , he recommended significant changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics . In July 1942 , he assumed command of the Allied Air Forces and Fifth Air Force in General Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific Area . Under Kenney 's command , the Allied Air Forces developed innovative command structures , weapons , and tactics that reflected Kenney 's orientation towards attack aviation . The new weapons and tactics won perhaps his greatest victory , the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , in March 1943 . In June 1944 he was appointed commander of the Far East Air Forces ( FEAF ) , which came to include the Fifth , Thirteenth , and Seventh Air Forces . In April 1946 , Kenney became the first commander of the newly formed Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) , but his performance in the role was criticized , and he was shifted to become commander of the Air University , a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951 . = = Early life = = George Churchill Kenney was born in Yarmouth , Nova Scotia , Canada , on 6 August 1889 , during a summer vacation taken by his parents to avoid the humidity of the Boston area . The oldest of four children of carpenter Joseph Atwood Kenney and his wife Anne Louise Kenney , n\u00e9e Churchill , Kenney grew up in Brookline , Massachusetts . He graduated from Brookline High School in 1907 and later that year he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , where he pursued a course in civil engineering . After his father left his family , Kenney quit MIT and took various jobs before becoming a surveyor for the Quebec Saguenay Railroad . His mother died in 1913 and Kenney returned to Boston , where he took a job with Stone & Webster . In 1914 he joined the New York , New Haven and Hartford Railroad as a civil engineer , building a bridge in New London , Connecticut . After this was completed , he formed a partnership , the Beaver Contracting and Engineering Corporation , with a high school classmate , Gordon Glazier . The firm became involved in a number of projects , including the construction of a seawall at Winthrop , Massachusetts , and a bridge over the Squannacook River . = = World War I = = The United States entered World War I in April 1917 , and Kenney enlisted as a flying cadet in the Aviation Section , U.S. Signal Corps on 2 June 1917 . He attended ground school at MIT in June and July , and received primary flight training at Hazelhurst Field in Mineola , New York , from Bert Acosta . He was commissioned as a first lieutenant on 5 November 1917 , and departed for France soon after . There , he received further flight training at Issoudun . This ended in February 1918 , when he was assigned to the 91st Aero Squadron . The 91st Aero Squadron flew the Salmson 2A2 , a reconnaissance biplane . Kenney crashed one on takeoff on 22 March 1918 . He broke an ankle and a hand , and earned himself the nickname \" Bust ' em up George \" . His injuries soon healed , and he recorded his first mission on 3 June . Kenney flew one of four aircraft on a mission near Gorze on 15 September 1918 that was attacked by six German Pfalz D.III scouts . His observer shot one of them down , and Kenney was credited with his first aerial victory . For this he was awarded a Silver Star . A second victory followed in similar circumstances on 9 October while he was flying near Jametz in support of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive . Once again , the formation he was flying with was attacked by German fighters . This time he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross , which was presented by Brigadier General Billy Mitchell on 10 January 1919 . Kenney 's citation read : For extraordinary heroism in action near Jametz , France , October 9 , 1918 . This officer gave proof of his bravery and devotion to duty when he was attacked by a superior number of aircraft . He accepted combat , destroyed one plane and drove the others off . Notwithstanding that the enemy returned and attacked again in strong numbers , he continued his mission and enabled his observer to secure information of great military value . Kenney remained for a time with the Allied occupation forces in Germany , and was promoted to captain on 18 March 1919 . He returned to the United States in June 1919 . He was sent to Kelly Field , near San Antonio , Texas , and then to McAllen , Texas . As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron , he flew reconnaissance missions along the border with Mexico during the Mexican Revolution . Poor aircraft maintenance , rough landing strips and bad weather led to the squadron losing 22 of its 24 Airco DH.4 aircraft in just one year . = = Between the wars = = Kenney applied for one of a number of Regular Army commissions offered to reservists after the war , and was commissioned as a captain in the Air Service on 1 July 1920 . While he was in hospital in Texas recovering from an aviation accident , he met a nurse , Helen \" Hazel \" Dell Richardson , the daughter of a Mobile , Alabama , contractor , George W. Richardson . They were married in Mobile on 6 October 1920 . Hazel miscarried twins , and was warned by her doctor of the danger of another pregnancy , but she strongly wished to have a child . In 1922 , while the couple was living on Long Island , New York , a son , William Richardson Kenney , was born to them , but Hazel died soon afterward from complications . Kenney arranged to have the infant cared for by his neighbor , Alice Steward Maxey , another nurse . On 5 June 1923 Kenney married Maxey in her home town of Gardiner , Maine . From July to November 1920 , Kenney was air detachment commander at Camp Knox , Kentucky . He then became a student at the Air Service Engineering School at McCook Field , near Dayton Ohio . He was the Air Service Inspector at the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in Garden City , New York , where he was responsible for the acceptance of the fifty Martin NBS-1 bombers that the Air Service had ordered from Curtis between 1921 and 1923 . Kenney inspected the aircraft , and test flew them . While there , he was reduced in rank from captain to first lieutenant on 18 November 1922 , a common occurrence in the aftermath of World War I when the wartime army was demobilized . He returned to McCook in 1923 , and developed techniques for mounting .30 caliber machine guns on the wings of a DH.4. He was promoted to captain again on 3 November 1923 . His daughter , Julia Churchill Kenney , was born in Dayton in June 1926 . In 1926 , Kenney became a student at the Air Corps Tactical School , at Langley Field , Virginia , the Air Corps ' advanced training school . He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , the Army 's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers . Most Air Corps officers , including Kenney , considered the course largely irrelevant to them , and therefore a waste of time , but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army . Afterwards , he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor . He taught classes of attack aviation . He was particularly interested in low-level attacks , as a means of improving accuracy . There were tactical problems with this , as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire . There were also technical problems to be solved , as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments . His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking . Kenney reached the pinnacle of his professional education in September 1932 , when he entered the Army War College in Washington , D.C .. At the war college , committees of students studied a number of World War I battles ; Kenney 's committee examined the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes . They updated actual war plans , Kenney 's study group working on War Plan Orange . They also had to write an individual paper ; Kenney wrote his on \" The Proper Composition of the Air Force \" . One benefit of the Army War College was that it brought Air Corps officers into contact with ground officers that they would later have to work closely with . Members of Kenney 's class included Richard Sutherland and Stephen Chamberlain , both of whom worked with him on committees . Graduation from the Army War College was normally followed by a staff posting , and on graduation in June 1933 Kenney became an assistant to Major James E. Chaney in the Plans Division of the Office of the Chief of the Air Corps , Major General Benjamin Foulois . He performed various duties , including translating an article by the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet into English . In 1934 , he was involved with drafting legislation that granted the Air Corps a greater degree of independence . This legislation prompted the Army to create GHQ Air Force , a centralized , air force-level command headed by an aviator answering directly to the Army Chief of Staff . Lieutenant Colonel Frank M. Andrews was chosen to command it , and selected Kenney as his Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Training . In this role , Kenney was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on 2 March 1935 , skipping that of major . He became involved in an acrimonious debate with the Army General Staff over the Air Corps ' desire to purchase more Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers . He also became caught up in a bureaucratic battle between Andrews and Major General Oscar Westover over whether the Chief of the Air Corps should control GHQ Air Force . As a result , Kenney was transferred to the Infantry School at Fort Benning , Georgia , on 16 June 1936 , with the temporary rank of major , to teach tactics to young infantry officers . He was promoted to the substantive rank of major on 1 October 1937 , but the assignment was hardly a choice one for an Air Corps officer . In September 1938 he accepted an offer to command the 97th Observation Squadron at Mitchell Field , New York . = = World War II = = In 1939 , Kenney was made Chief of the Production Engineering Section at Wright Field , Ohio . He was sent to France in early 1940 , once again with the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel , as Assistant Military Attach\u00e9 for Air . His mission was to observe Allied air operations during the early stages of World War II . As a result of his observations , he recommended many important changes to Air Corps equipment and tactics , including upgrading armament from .30 caliber to .50 caliber machine guns , and installing leak-proof fuel tanks , but his scathing comparisons of the German Luftwaffe with the Air Corps upset many officers . This resulted in his being sent back to Wright Field . In January 1941 , he became commander of the Air Corps Experimental Depot and Engineering School there , with the rank of brigadier general . He was promoted to major general on 26 March 1942 , when he became commander of the Fourth Air Force , an air defense and training organization based in San Francisco . Kenney personally instructed pilots on how to handle the Lockheed P-38 Lightning and A-29 Hudson . = = = Southwest Pacific Area = = = In July 1942 , Kenney received orders to take over the Allied Air Forces and Fifth Air Force in General Douglas MacArthur 's Southwest Pacific Area . MacArthur had been dissatisfied with the performance of his air commander , Lieutenant General George Brett . Andrews , by then a major general , turned down the job , and , offered a choice between Kenney and Major General James Doolittle , MacArthur chose Kenney . Kenney reported to MacArthur in Brisbane on 28 July 1942 , and was treated to \" a lecture for approximately an hour on the shortcomings of the Air Force in general , and the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific in particular . \" Kenney felt that MacArthur did not understand air operations , but recognized that he somehow needed to establish a good working relationship with him . When he asked MacArthur for authority to send people he considered \" deadwood \" home , something that his superiors in Washington , D.C. had refused to give , MacArthur enthusiastically approved . Building a good relationship with MacArthur meant getting past Sutherland , MacArthur 's chief of staff . Brett advised Kenney that \" a showdown early in the game with Sutherland might clarify the entire atmosphere . \" Sutherland , who had a civil pilot 's license , had taken to issuing detailed instructions to the Allied Air Forces . This was more than simply a turf battle ; to many airmen , it was a part of the ongoing battle for an independent air force that they had long been advocating . At one point , Kenney drew a dot on a plain page of paper and told Sutherland , \" the dot represents what you know about air operations , the entire rest of the paper what I know . \" Sutherland backed down , and would henceforth let Kenney run the Allied Air Forces without interference . It did not follow , however , that MacArthur would invariably accept Kenney 's advice . Kenney sent home Major General Ralph Royce , Brigadier Generals Edwin S. Perrin , Albert Sneed and Martin Scanlon , and about forty colonels . In Australia , he found two talented , recently arrived brigadier generals , Ennis Whitehead and Kenneth Walker . Kenney reorganized his command in August , appointed Whitehead as commander of the V Fighter Command and Walker as commander of the V Bomber Command . The Allied Air Forces was composed of both United States Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) and Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) personnel . Kenney moved to separate them . Brigadier General Donald Wilson arrived in September and replaced Air Vice Marshal William Bostock as Kenney 's chief of staff . Bostock took over the newly created RAAF Command . This brought Kenney into conflict with the Chief of the Air Staff of the RAAF , Air Vice Marshal George Jones , who felt that an opportunity had been lost to simplify the administration of the RAAF . Kenney preferred to have Bostock in command , and while he regarded the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance , was happy to leave arrangements the way they were . However , Kenney deviated from the normal structure of an air force by creating the Advanced Echelon ( ADVON ) under Whitehead . The new headquarters had the authority to change the assignments of aircraft in the forward area , where fast-changing weather and enemy action could overtake orders drawn up in Australia . Kenney was promoted to lieutenant general on 21 October 1942 . Perhaps because of his experience in World War I , Kenney had a great deal of respect for Japanese fighters . He decided to conserve his bombers , and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea . Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided . SWPA had a low priority , and simply could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions . What he needed was an effective long-range fighter , and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill , but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems . Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft . The Southwest Pacific was not a promising theater of war for the strategic bomber . The bombers of the day did not have the range to reach Japan from Australia , and there were no typical strategic targets in the theater other than a few oil refineries . This set up a doctrinal clash between Kenney , an attack aviator , and Walker , the bomber advocate . The long-standing Air Corps tactic for attacking shipping called for large formations of high-altitude bombers . With sufficient mass , so the theory went , bombers could bracket any ship with walls of bombs , and do so from above the effective range of the ship 's anti-aircraft fire . However the theoretical mass required was two orders of magnitude greater than what was available in the Southwest Pacific . A dozen or so bombers was the most that could be put together , owing to the small number of aircraft in the theater and the difficulties of keeping them serviceable . The results were therefore generally ineffective , and operations incurred heavy casualties . Walker resisted Kenney 's proposals that the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with instantaneous fuses . Kenney ordered Walker to try the fuses for a couple of months , so that data could be gained about their effectiveness ; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use . In November , Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth , a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice . After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage . As expected , none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck , but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water , so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship . Walker reluctantly conceded the point . A few weeks later , Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul , an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night . In addition to trying different types of ordnance , the Allied Air Forces experimented with modifications to the aircraft themselves. the Major Paul I. \" Pappy \" Gunn modified some USAAF Douglas A-20 Havoc light bombers by installing four .50 in ( 12.7 mm ) machine guns in their noses , and two 450-US-gallon ( 1,700 l ; 370 imp gal ) fuel tanks were added to give the aircraft more range . This was successful , and an attempt was then made to create a longer range attack aircraft by doing the same thing to a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber , to operate as a \" commerce destroyer \" . This proved to be somewhat more difficult . The resulting aircraft was obviously nose heavy despite adding lead ballast to the tail , and the vibrations caused by firing the machine guns were enough to make rivets pop out of the skin of the aircraft . The tail guns and belly turrets were removed , the latter being of little use if the aircraft was flying low . The Allied Air Forces also adopted innovative tactics . In February 1942 , the RAAF began experimenting with skip bombing , an anti-shipping technique used by the British and Germans . Flying only a few dozen feet above the sea toward their targets , aircraft would release their bombs , which would then , ideally , ricochet across the surface of the water and explode at the side of the target ship , under it , or just over it . A similar technique was mast-height bombing , in which bombers would approach the target at low altitude , 200 to 500 feet ( 61 to 152 m ) , at about 265 to 275 miles per hour ( 426 to 443 km / h ) , and then drop down to mast height , 10 to 15 feet ( 3.0 to 4.6 m ) about 600 yards ( 550 m ) from the target . They would release their bombs at around 300 yards ( 270 m ) , aiming directly at the side of the ship . The two techniques were not mutually exclusive . A bomber could drop two bombs , skipping the first and launching the second at mast height . The Battle of the Bismarck Sea demonstrated the effectiveness of low-level attacks on shipping . Another form of airpower employed by Kenney was air transport . This started in September 1942 when troops of the 32nd Infantry Division were airlifted from Australia to Port Moresby . Later in the campaign , C-47 Dakotas landed Australian troops at Wanigela . A year later , American paratroops landed at Nadzab , enabling the Australian 7th Division to be flown in . The ultimate challenge was to integrate air power with MacArthur 's strategy . Kenney described the process this way in 1944 : The first step in this advancement of the bomber line is to gain and maintain air control as far into enemy territory as our longest range fighters can reach . Then we put an air blockade around the Jap positions or section of the coast which we want in order to stop him from getting supplies or reinforcements . The bombers then go to work and pulverize his defensive system , methodically taking out artillery positions , stores , bivouac areas and so on . Finally comes the air cover escorting the amphibious expedition to the landing beach , a last minute blasting and smoking of the enemy beach defenses and the maintenance of strafers and fighters overhead , on call from the surface forces until their beachhead is secured . If emergency supplies are needed we drop them by parachute . The ground troops get a transport field ready as fast as possible so that we can supplement boat supply by cargo carrying airplanes . When necessary , we evacuate the wounded and sick and bring in reinforcements in a hurry . The transport field becomes a fighter field , the strafers and finally the heavies arrive and it is time to move forward again . = = = Far East Air Forces = = = In June 1944 , Kenney was appointed commander of the Far East Air Forces ( FEAF ) , which came to include the Fifth , Thirteenth , and Seventh Air Forces . He created the 1st , 2nd and 3rd Air Task Forces to control air operations in forward areas , each for a specific mission , another departure from doctrine . While Kenney was enthusiastic about this innovation , Washington did not like it and , over Kenney 's objections , converted the three air task forces into the 308th , 309th and 310th Bombardment Wings . He was promoted to general on 9 March 1945 . Kenney hoped to get Boeing B-29 Superfortresses assigned to the Far East Air Forces so that , based from airfields near Darwin , they could destroy the Japanese oilfields at Balikpapan . His agitation for the B-29s did not endear him to the USAAF staff in Washington , D.C. After the war , the Strategic Bombing Survey concluded that this would have been far more productive than Operation Matterhorn , which saw B-29s based in China to bomb steel plants in Japan , as oil was more critical to the Japanese war effort than steel . = = = War crimes accusation = = = On 4 March 1943 , during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea , General George Kenney ordered Allied patrol boats and aircraft to attack Japanese rescue vessels , as well as the survivors from the sunken vessels on life rafts and swimming or floating in the sea . This was later justified on the grounds that rescued servicemen would have been rapidly landed at their military destination and promptly returned to active service . These orders violated the Hague Convention of 1907 , which banned the killing of shipwreck survivors under any circumstances . = = Post-war career = = In April 1946 , Kenney became the first commander of the newly formed Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) . He was encouraged by Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington to join him in the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force . Separately , the two men gave promotional speeches around the country . As a result , SAC 's efficiency suffered . On 8 May 1946 , Kenney publicly presented the Medal of Honor to the family of Thomas B. McGuire , Jr , the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot , who had been killed in action . Kenney left day-to-day operations at SAC in the hands of his deputy commander , Major General St. Clair Streett . Part of the reason for Kenney 's lack of focus on SAC was also his assignment as U.S. representative to the United Nations Military Staff Committee , which appeared at that time to be potentially an important assignment . In January 1947 , Streett was replaced by Major General Clements McMullen . With McMullen serving officially as Kenney 's deputy but actually in command , a cross-training program was implemented in early 1948 to teach bomber crew members each other 's tasks , the goal being to reduce each bomber 's contingent of officers from five to three . Morale suffered as a result . Major General Lauris Norstad , responsible for reporting the readiness of American airpower to the U.S. Secretary of Defense , James Forrestal , heard from unhappy airmen that the SAC was in a poor state of readiness , and he initiated an investigation . He selected Charles Lindbergh and Paul Tibbets to perform the inquiry . Tibbets told Norstad that he found nobody at SAC knew their job . Lindbergh said that McMullen 's cross-training program \" seriously interfered with training the primary mission . \" On 6 May 1948 , Kenney spoke to a crowd in Bangor , Maine , telling them that the US was likely to be attacked by the Soviet Union as soon as the latter had enough atomic bombs . In Washington , D.C. , a group of senators including Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. complained of Kenney 's \" belligerent \" speech , and previous ones in the same vein by Symington , saying that matters of foreign policy should be left to the president and the secretary of state , not to leaders of the United States Air Force ( USAF ) . Another controversy that Kenney became embroiled in concerned the Convair B-36 Peacemaker . He was less than impressed with this expensive and under-performing aircraft , preferring the Boeing B-50 Superfortress , an upgraded version of the B-29 instead . The USAF , however , had staked much of its credibility on the B-36 , something that Kenney did not seem to appreciate . In the context of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948 , the Air Force Chief of Staff , General Hoyt S. Vandenberg met with Forrestal to report the poor state of SAC . Following this meeting , Norstad recommended that Vandenberg replace Kenney , and Vandenberg quickly agreed , choosing Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay as the man he would prefer to lead the strategic bombing arm in case of war with the USSR . LeMay was made leader of SAC , and Kenney became commander of the Air University , a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951 . = = Retirement = = After his retirement , he lived in Bay Harbor Islands , Florida . In 1958 he appeared as the host of the TV anthology series Flight . He died on 9 August 1977 . = = Books = = Kenney wrote three books about the SWPA air campaigns he led during World War II . His major work was General Kenney Reports ( 1949 ) , a personal history of the air war he led from 1942 to 1945 . He also wrote The Saga of Pappy Gunn ( 1959 ) and Dick Bong : Ace of Aces ( 1960 ) , which described the careers of Paul Gunn and Richard Bong , two of the most prominent airmen under his command . = = Family = = He was survived by his two children , five grandsons and one granddaughter .

In 1948 she married Edward C. Hoagland Jr . , a fighter pilot in World War II and later in Korea , who eventually retired from the USAF at the rank of lieutenant colonel . = = Awards = = During a career that spanned over 30 years , Kenney was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with one oak leaf cluster , the Distinguished Service Medal with one oak leaf cluster , the Silver Star Medal , the Distinguished Flying Cross , the Bronze Star Medal , the Purple Heart and several foreign decorations .",

                    "text": "Admiral Hipper-class cruiser = The Admiral Hipper class was a group of five heavy cruisers built by Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine in the mid-1930s . The class comprised Admiral Hipper , the lead ship , Bl\u00fccher , Prinz Eugen , Seydlitz , and L\u00fctzow . Only the first three ships of the class saw action during World War II . Work on Seydlitz stopped when she was approximately 95 percent complete ; it was decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier , but this was not completed either . L\u00fctzow was sold incomplete to the Soviet Union in 1940 . Admiral Hipper and Bl\u00fccher took part in Operation Weser\u00fcbung , the invasion of Norway in April 1940 . Bl\u00fccher was sunk by Norwegian coastal defenses outside Oslo while Admiral Hipper led the attack on Trondheim . She then conducted sorties into the Atlantic to attack Allied merchant shipping . In 1942 , she was deployed to northern Norway to attack shipping to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea in December 1942 , where she was damaged by British cruisers . Prinz Eugen saw her first action during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung with the battleship Bismarck . She eventually returned to Germany during the Channel Dash in 1942 , after which she too went to Norway . After being torpedoed by a British submarine , she returned to Germany for repairs . Admiral Hipper while decommissioned after returning to Germany in early 1943 , was partially repaired and recommissioned in the fall of 1944 for a refugee transport mission in 1945 . Only Prinz Eugen continued to serve in full commission and stayed in the Baltic until the end of the war . Admiral Hipper was scuttled in Kiel in May 1945 , leaving Prinz Eugen as the only member of the class to survive the war . She was ceded to the US Navy , which ultimately expended the ship in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in 1946 . Seydlitz was towed to K\u00f6nigsberg and scuttled before the advancing Soviet Army could seize the ship . She was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap . L\u00fctzow , renamed Petropavlovsk , remained unfinished when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union . The ship provided artillery support against advancing German forces until she was sunk in September 1941 . She was raised a year later and repaired enough to participate in the campaign to relieve the Siege of Leningrad in 1944 . She served on in secondary roles until the 1950s , when she was broken up . = = Design = = = = = Development = = = Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles limited the German Reichsmarine to six battleships of the \" Deutschland or Lothringen types \" and six old light cruisers . These obsolete ships could not be replaced until they were at least twenty years old , and their replacements could displace no more than 10,000 long tons ( 10,000 t ) and 6,000 long tons ( 6,100 t ) , respectively . In February 1922 , the major naval powers signed the Washington Naval Treaty ; Germany was not invited to attend , but she would be held to the same qualitative limitations as the signatories . By the early 1920s , the cruisers of the Reichsmarine were old enough to permit replacement ; the three K\u00f6nigsberg-class cruisers and Leipzig were built in the middle of the decade . The 1930 London Naval Treaty formally divided cruiser types into two categories : heavy cruisers , armed with 20.3 cm ( 8.0 in ) guns , and light cruisers , armed with 15.5 cm ( 6.1 in ) guns . The Treaty of Versailles still prohibited Germany from building heavy cruisers , but the rise of Adolf Hitler 's Nazi Party to power in 1933 led to the formal rejection of the Treaty of Versailles . After pulling out of the Geneva Conference in 1933 , Hitler argued that if the other European powers did not disarm to parity with Germany , they should accept German rearmament . The German navy , renamed the Kriegsmarine on 21 May 1935 , was now free to pursue rearmament . Germany concluded the Anglo-German Naval Agreement with Great Britain , which set German naval strength at 35 % of the size of the Royal Navy . This permitted Germany to build 50,000 long tons ( 51,000 t ) of heavy cruisers , enough for five 10,000-ton ships . The design for the first three of the five Admiral Hipper-class ships was prepared in 1934 \u2013 1935 . Seydlitz and L\u00fctzow were initially designed as light cruisers ; their design was prepared in 1934 \u2013 1936 . These last two ships were to be armed with four triple turrets housing 15 cm ( 5.9 in ) guns , as opposed to the four twin 20.3 cm ( 8.0 in ) guns on the first three ships . The \" light cruisers \" were otherwise planned to follow the same particulars as their three \" heavy \" half-sisters . On 14 November 1936 , the Navy decided to complete the final two ships identically to the other members of the class . = = = General characteristics = = = The ships of the Admiral Hipper class varied slightly in size . Admiral Hipper was 195.5 meters ( 641 ft ) long at the waterline and 202.8 m ( 665 ft ) overall . After the installation of a clipper bow during fitting out , her overall length increased to 205 m ( 673 ft ) . The ship had a beam of 21.3 m ( 70 ft ) . Bl\u00fccher was 195 m ( 640 ft ) long at the waterline and 203.2 m ( 667 ft ) overall ; with the clipper bow , her overall length was 205.9 m ( 676 ft ) . Her beam was 22 m ( 72 ft ) . Both ships had a designed draft of 6.5 m ( 21 ft ) and a full load draft of 7.2 m ( 24 ft ) . Prinz Eugen was 199.5 m ( 655 ft ) at the waterline and 207.7 m ( 681 ft ) long overall ; with the clipper bow , her overall length was 212.5 m ( 697 ft ) . Her beam was 21.7 m ( 71 ft ) and a draft of 6.6 m ( 22 ft ) standard and 7.2 m at full load . Seydlitz and L\u00fctzow were 210 m ( 690 ft ) long overall , with beams of 21.8 m ( 72 ft ) and drafts of 6.9 m ( 23 ft ) standard and 7.9 m ( 26 ft ) at full load . Admiral Hipper and Bl\u00fccher had a designed displacement of 16,170 metric tons ( 15,910 long tons ; 17,820 short tons ) and a full load displacement of 18,200 long tons ( 18,500 t ) . Prinz Eugen 's displacement increased slightly , to 16,970 t ( 16,700 long tons ; 18,710 short tons ) designed and 18,750 long tons ( 19,050 t ) full load . Seydlitz and L\u00fctzow grew heavier still , at 17,600 t ( 17,300 long tons ; 19,400 short tons ) designed and 19,800 long tons ( 20,100 t ) full load . The ships ' hulls were constructed from longitudinal steel frames . The hulls were divided into fourteen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 72 percent of the length of the keel . The Kriegsmarine regarded the ships as good sea boats , with gentle motion . At low speed , however , they were affected unpredictably by wind and currents . The ships heeled up to fourteen degrees and lost up to 50 % speed with the rudder hard over at high speed . The ships had a standard complement of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men . Wartime modifications increased the crew to 51 officers and 1,548 sailors . The ships carried several smaller vessels , including two picket boats , two barges , one launch , one pinnace , and two dinghies . = = = Machinery = = = The Admiral Hipper-class ships were powered by three sets of geared steam turbines . Admiral Hipper 's and Bl\u00fccher 's engines were built by Blohm & Voss , while Prinz Eugen 's turbines were built by Germaniawerft . The turbines installed on Seydlitz 's and L\u00fctzow 's engines were manufactured by Deschimag . Steam was provided in the first three ships by twelve ultra-high pressure boilers . Seydlitz and L\u00fctzow were equipped with nine double-ended high-pressure boilers . Admiral Hipper 's and Prinz Eugen 's boilers were manufactured by Wagner , while the boilers for the other three ships were built by La Mont . Each turbine drove a three-bladed screw 4.1 m ( 13 ft ) in diameter . The ships ' engines were rated at 132,000 shaft horsepower ( 98,000 kW ) for a top speed of 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) . They carried 1,420 to 1,460 t ( 1,400 to 1,440 long tons ; 1,570 to 1,610 short tons ) of fuel oil as designed , though the ships could carry up to 3,050 to 3,250 t ( 3,000 to 3,200 long tons ; 3,360 to 3,580 short tons ) . At a cruising speed of 20 kn ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) , the ships had a maximum range of 6,800 nautical miles ( 12,600 km ; 7,800 mi ) . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . Admiral Hipper and Bl\u00fccher were equipped with three electricity plants with four diesel generators and six turbo-generators each ; the diesel generators supplied 150 kW apiece , four of the six turbo-generators provided 460 kW , and the final pair provided 230 kW . Total electrical output was 2900 kW . Prinz Eugen , Seydlitz , and L\u00fctzow were equipped with three 150 kW diesel generators , four 460 kW turbo-generators , one 230 kW turbo-generator , and one 150 kW AC generator , for a total of 2870 kW . All five ships ' electrical plants operated at 220 volts . = = = Armament = = = The three completed ships were armed with eight 20.3 cm ( 8.0 in ) SK C / 34 guns in four twin turrets . The ships were supplied with between 960 and 1,280 rounds of ammunition , or 120 to 160 rounds per gun . The guns were mounted in Drh LC / 34 turrets , which enabled depression to \u2212 10 \u00b0 and elevation to 37 \u00b0 . At maximum elevation , the gun could reach out to 33,540 m ( 110,040 ft ) . It fired a 122 kg ( 269 lb ) projectile at a muzzle velocity of 925 meters per second ( 3,030 ft / s ) . The projectiles included armor-piercing shells , base-fuzed and nose-fuzed high-explosive ( HE ) warheads . Each ship was also supplied with 40 illumination rounds that weighed 103 kg ( 227 lb ) and had a muzzle velocity of 700 m / s ( 2,300 ft / s ) . The four gun turrets built for Seydlitz were emplaced as coastal artillery pieces in the Atlantic Wall . Only the two forward turrets had been installed on L\u00fctzow when she was delivered to the Soviet Union . The ships ' heavy anti-aircraft battery consisted of twelve 10.5 cm ( 4.1 in ) SK C / 33 guns in twin mountings . These guns were supplied with a total of 4,800 rounds of ammunition . The mounts were the Dopp LC / 31 type , originally designed for earlier 8.8 cm ( 3.5 in ) SK C / 31 guns . The LC / 31 mounting was triaxially-stabilized and capable of elevating to 80 \u00b0 . This enabled the guns to engage targets up to a ceiling of 12,500 m ( 41,000 ft ) . Against surface targets , the guns had a maximum range of 17,700 m ( 58,100 ft ) . The guns fired fixed ammunition weighing 15.1 kg ( 33 lb ) ; the guns could fire HE and HE incendiary rounds , as well as illumination shells . Close-range anti-aircraft weaponry initially consisted of twelve 3.7 cm ( 1.5 in ) SK C / 30 guns and eight 2 cm ( 0.79 in ) Flak 38 guns . The 3.7 cm gun was a single-shot gun , with a rate of fire of around 30 rounds per minute . At its maximum elevation of 85 \u00b0 , the gun had a ceiling of 6,800 m ( 22,300 ft ) . The 2 cm gun was a magazine-fed automatic weapon , firing at up to 500 rounds per minute . Twenty and forty-round magazines were supplied for the guns ; The guns were supplied with 16,000 rounds of ammunition . Later in the war , the light anti-aircraft batteries for Admiral Hipper and Prinz Eugen were modified . Four 3.7 cm guns were removed and the number of 2 cm guns had increased to twenty-eight . In 1944 , Prinz Eugen 's 3.7 cm guns were replaced by fifteen 4 cm ( 1.6 in ) Flak 28 guns . By 1945 , the ship 's light anti-aircraft battery comprised twenty 4 cm guns and eighteen 2 cm guns ; Admiral Hipper mounted sixteen 4 cm guns and fourteen 2 cm guns . The ships ' armament was rounded out by twelve torpedo tubes ; they were mounted in four triple launchers on the ships ' main deck . The ships carried twenty-four G7a torpedoes , twelve loaded in the tubes and one reload for each . The G7a torpedo carried a 300 kg ( 660 lb ) warhead . It had three speed settings ; in 1939 , it could reach 12,500 m ( 41,000 ft ) at 30 kn ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) , 7,500 m ( 24,600 ft ) at 40 kn ( 74 km / h ; 46 mph ) , and 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) at 44 kn ( 81 km / h ; 51 mph ) , its maximum speed setting . The 340 horsepower ( 250 kW ) radial engine was improved during the war , which improved performance . The ranges increased to 14,000 m ( 46,000 ft ) , 8,000 m ( 26,000 ft ) , and 6,000 m ( 20,000 ft ) , respectively . Admiral Hipper also carried 96 EMC mines ; these mines were contact mines and had a 300 kg explosive charge . = = = Armor = = = The five Admiral Hipper-class ships were protected by Krupp steel armor , of both Wotan Hart and Wotan Weich types . The ships had two armored decks to protect the ship from vertical attacks . The upper deck was 30 mm ( 1.2 in ) thick amidships to protect the ships ' vitals . At either end , the deck was reduced to 12 mm ( 0.47 in ) thickness . The bow and stern was not protected by deck armor . The main armored deck was 20 to 50 mm ( 0.79 to 1.97 in ) thick . Both decks were Wotan Hart steel . The main armored belt was 80 mm ( 3.1 in ) thick amidships and reduced to 70 mm ( 2.8 in ) thick aft . An interior 20 mm thick torpedo bulkhead protected the ships ' vitals from underwater attack . The ships ' main battery turrets were protected with 105 mm ( 4.1 in ) thick faces and 70 mm thick sides . Their roofs were also 70 mm thick . The 10.5 cm guns were equipped with 10 to 15 mm ( 0.39 to 0.59 in ) thick gun shields . The forward conning tower had 150 mm ( 5.9 in ) thick sides and a 50 mm ( 2.0 in ) thick roof . The rear conning tower was significantly less well armored , with only splinter protection . Their sides were 30 mm thick with a 20 mm thick roof . The anti-aircraft fire directors were also given splinter protection , with 17 mm ( 0.67 in ) thick shields . = = Construction = = Admiral Hipper ordered as \" H \" , as a replacement for the light cruiser Hamburg . She was laid down at the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg under construction number 501 , on 6 July 1935 . She was launched on 6 February 1937 and fitting out work was completed two years later in April 1939 ; the ship was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on 29 April 1939 . Bl\u00fccher , ordered as \" G \" to replace Berlin , was built by the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel , under construction number 246 . Her keel was laid on 15 August 1936 and launched 8 June 1937 . Work on the ship was finished by 20 September 1939 , the day she was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine . Prinz Eugen , the last ship of the class to be completed , was ordered from the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel as \" J \" under construction number 564 . She was laid down on 23 April 1936 and launched on 22 August 1938 . She was commissioned into the Kriegsmarine on 1 August 1940 . Seydlitz and L\u00fctzow were both built by the Deutsche Schiff- und Maschinenbau shipyard in Bremen ; Seydlitz was ordered as \" K \" , under construction number 940 , and L\u00fctzow was ordered as \" L \" under construction number 941 . Seydlitz was laid down on 29 December 1936 and L\u00fctzow followed her on 2 August 1937 . The ships were launched on 19 January 1939 and 1 July 1939 , respectively . Work ceased on Seydlitz when she was approximately 95 percent complete . In October 1939 , the Soviet Union approached Germany with a request to purchase the then unfinished Prinz Eugen , Seydlitz , and L\u00fctzow , along with plans for German capital ships , naval artillery , and other naval technology . The Kriegsmarine denied the request for Seydlitz and Prinz Eugen , but agreed to sell L\u00fctzow . = = Service history = = = = = Admiral Hipper = = = Admiral Hipper led the assault on Trondheim during Operation Weser\u00fcbung ; while en route to her objective , she sank the British destroyer HMS Glowworm . In December 1940 , she broke out into the Atlantic Ocean to operate against Allied merchant shipping , though this operation ended without significant success . In February 1941 , Admiral Hipper sortied again , sinking several merchant vessels before eventually returning to Germany via the Denmark Strait . The ship was then transferred to northern Norway to participate in operations against convoys to the Soviet Union , culminating in the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942 , where she was damaged and forced to withdraw by the light cruisers HMS Sheffield and HMS Jamaica . Enraged by the defeat at the battle , Adolf Hitler ordered the majority of the surface warships scrapped , though Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz was able to convince Hitler to retain the surface fleet . As a result , Admiral Hipper was returned to Germany and decommissioned for repairs . The ship was never restored to operational status , however , and on 3 May 1945 , Royal Air Force bombers severely damaged Admiral Hipper while she was in Kiel . Her crew scuttled the ship at her moorings , and in July 1945 , she was raised and towed to Heikendorfer Bay . She was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1948 \u2013 1952 ; her bell resides in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich . = = = Bl\u00fccher = = = Following her commissioning in November 1939 , Bl\u00fccher conducted a series of sea trials and training exercises in the Baltic , which lasted until March 1940 . She was pronounced ready for service with the fleet on 5 April 1940 . Assigned to Group 5 during the invasion of Norway in April 1940 , the ship served as Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz 's flagship . The ship led the flotilla of warships into the Oslofjord on the night of 8 April , to seize Oslo , the capital of Norway . Two old 28 cm ( 11 in ) coastal guns in the Oscarsborg Fortress engaged the ship at very close range , scoring two damaging hits . Two torpedoes fired by land-based torpedo batteries struck the ship , causing serious damage . A major fire broke out aboard Bl\u00fccher , which could not be contained . After a magazine explosion , the ship slowly capsized and sank , with major loss of life . The wreck remains on the bottom of the Oslofjord ; several salvage attempts were considered after 1963 , but none were carried out . The ship 's screws were removed in 1953 and divers removed over 1,000 t ( 980 long tons ; 1,100 short tons ) of fuel oil from the ship 's bunkers in 1994 , though oil from unaccessible fuel tanks is still leaking from the sunken ship . At the time the divers removed the oil , they also recovered one of her Ar 196 floatplanes , which is preserved in Stavanger . = = = Prinz Eugen = = = Prinz Eugen saw extensive action during Operation Rhein\u00fcbung , an attempted breakout into the Atlantic Ocean with the battleship Bismarck in May 1941 . The two ships engaged the British battlecruiser Hood and battleship Prince of Wales in the Battle of Denmark Strait , during which Hood was destroyed and Prince of Wales was severely damaged . Prinz Eugen was detached from Bismarck during the operation to raid Allied merchant shipping , but this was cut short due to engine troubles . After putting into occupied France and undergoing repairs , the ship participated in Operation Cerberus , a daring daylight dash through the English Channel back to Germany . In February 1942 , Prinz Eugen was deployed to Norway , although her time stationed there was cut short when she was torpedoed by the British submarine Trident days after arriving in Norwegian waters . The torpedo severely damaged the ship 's stern , which necessitated repairs in Germany . Upon returning to active service , the ship spent several months training new officer cadets in the Baltic before serving as artillery support to the retreating German Army on the Eastern Front . After the German collapse in May 1945 , the ship was surrendered to the British Royal Navy before being transferred to the US Navy as a war prize . After examining the ship in the United States , the US Navy assigned the cruiser to the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Bikini Atoll . After surviving both atomic blasts , Prinz Eugen was towed to Kwajalein Atoll where she ultimately capsized and sank in December 1946 . The wreck remains partially visible above the water ; one of her screws was salvaged and is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial in Germany . = = = Seydlitz = = = At the time construction on Seydlitz was halted , she was approximately 95 percent complete . The unfinished ship remained inactive until March 1942 , when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants . Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers . Renamed Weser , conversion work began on the ship in May 1942 . The majority of the superstructure was cut away , with the exception of the funnel , to prepare for the installation of a flight deck and an aircraft hangar . In total , approximately 2,400 t ( 2,400 long tons ; 2,600 short tons ) of material from the ship was removed . As a carrier , the ship was to have had a complement of ten Bf 109 fighters and ten Ju 87 dive-bombers . She would have been armed with an anti-aircraft battery of ten 10.5 cm SK C / 33 guns in dual mounts , ten 3.7 cm SK C / 30 guns in dual mounts , and twenty-four 2 cm Flak 38 guns in quadruple mounts . Conversion work was halted in June 1943 , however , and the incomplete vessel was towed to K\u00f6nigsberg where she was eventually scuttled on 29 January 1945 . The ship was seized by the advancing Soviet Army and was briefly considered for cannibalization for spare parts to complete her sister ship L\u00fctzow , which had been purchased by the Soviet Navy before the war . This plan was also abandoned , and the ship was broken up for scrap . = = = L\u00fctzow = = = In October 1939 , the Soviet Union requested the purchase of the incomplete L\u00fctzow . After a series of negotiations , the Kriegsmarine agreed to the sale in February 1940 , at the price of 150 million Reichsmarks . The transfer was completed on 15 April . The vessel was still incomplete when sold to the Soviet Union , with only half of her main battery of eight 20.3 cm ( 8.0 in ) guns installed and much of the superstructure missing . Renamed Petropavlovsk in September 1940 , work on the ship was effected by a German-advised Soviet shipyard in Leningrad . Still unfinished when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941 , the ship briefly took part in the defense of Leningrad by providing artillery support to the Soviet defenders . She was sunk by German artillery in September 1941 and raised a year later in September 1942 . After repairs were effected , the ship was renamed Tallinn and used in the Soviet counter-offensive that relieved Leningrad in 1944 . After the end of the war , the ship was used as a stationary training platform and as a floating barracks before being broken up for scrap sometime between 1953 and 1960 . = = See Also = = List of ships of the Second World War List of ship classes of the Second World War",

The command is part of the Department of Defense and is the only Unified Combatant Command legislated into being by the U.S. Congress . USSOCOM is headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa , Florida . The idea of a unified special operations command had its origins in the aftermath of Operation Eagle Claw , the disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at the American embassy in Iran in 1980 . The ensuing investigation , chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III , the retired Chief of Naval Operations , cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission . Since its activation on 16 April 1987 , U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations , from the 1989 invasion of Panama to the ongoing Global War on Terrorism . USSOCOM conducts several covert and clandestine missions , such as direct action , special reconnaissance , counter-terrorism , foreign internal defense , unconventional warfare , psychological warfare , civil affairs , and counter-narcotics operations . Each branch has a Special Operations Command that is unique and capable of running its own operations , but when the different special operations forces need to work together for an operation , USSOCOM becomes the joint component command of the operation , instead of a SOC of a specific branch . = = History = = The unworkable command and control structure of separate U.S. military special operations forces ( SOF ) , which led to the failure of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980 , highlighted the need within the Department of Defense for reform and reorganization . Since the incident , the Army Chief of Staff , General Edward C. \" Shy \" Meyer , called for a further restructuring of special operations capabilities , eventually helping to create the U.S. Delta Force . Although unsuccessful at the joint level , Meyer nevertheless went on to consolidate Army SOF units under the new 1st Special Operations Command in 1982 , a significant step to improve the U.S. Army 's SOF . By 1983 , there was a small but growing sense in the Congress for the need for military reforms . In June , the Senate Armed Services Committee ( SASC ) began a two-year-long study of the Defense Department , which included an examination of SOF spearheaded by Senator Barry Goldwater ( R-AZ ) . With concern mounting on Capitol Hill , the Department of Defense created the Joint Special Operations Agency on 1 January 1984 ; this agency , however , had neither operational nor command authority over any SOF . The Joint Special Operations Agency thus did little to improve SOF readiness , capabilities , or policies , and therefore was insufficient . Within the Defense Department , there were a few staunch SOF supporters . Noel Koch , Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs , and his deputy , Lynn Rylander , both advocated SOF reforms . At the same time , a few on Capitol Hill were determined to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces . They included Senators Sam Nunn ( D-GA ) and William Cohen ( R-ME ) , both members of the Armed Services Committee , and Representative Dan Daniel ( D-VA ) , the chairman of the United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness . Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations , that the country 's capability in this area was second rate , and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem . Senators Nunn and Cohen also felt strongly that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats . Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts . In October 1985 , the Senate Armed Services Committee published the results of its two-year review of the U.S. military structure , entitled \" Defense Organization : The Need For Change . \" Mr. James R. Locher III , the principal author of this study , also examined past special operations and speculated on the most likely future threats . This influential document led to the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 . By spring 1986 , SOF advocates had introduced reform bills in both houses of Congress . On 15 May , Senator Cohen introduced the Senate bill , co-sponsored by Senator Nunn and others , which called for a joint military organization for SOF and the establishment of an office in the Defense Department to ensure adequate funding and policy emphasis for low-intensity conflict and special operations . Representative Daniel 's proposal went even further \u2014 he wanted a national special operations agency headed by a civilian who would bypass the Joint Chiefs and report directly to the Secretary of Defense ; this would keep Joint Chiefs and the Services out of the SOF budget process . Congress held hearings on the two bills in the summer of 1986 . Admiral William J. Crowe Jr . , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , led the Pentagon 's opposition to the bills . He proposed , as an alternative , a new Special Operations Forces command led by a three-star general . This proposal was not well received on Capitol Hill \u2014 Congress wanted a four-star general in charge to give SOF more clout . A number of retired military officers and others testified in favor of the need for reform . By most accounts , retired Army Major General Richard Scholtes gave the most compelling reasons for change . Scholtes , who commanded the joint special operations task force in Grenada , explained how conventional force leaders misused SOF during the operation , not allowing them to use their unique capabilities , which resulted in high SOF casualties . After his formal testimony , Scholtes met privately with a small number of Senators to elaborate on the problems that he had encountered in Grenada . Both the House and Senate passed SOF reform bills , and these went to a conference committee for reconciliation . Senate and House conferees forged a compromise . The bill called for a unified combatant command headed by a four-star general for all SOF , an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict , a coordinating board for low-intensity conflict within the National Security Council , and a new Major Force Program ( MFP-11 ) for SOF ( the so-called \" SOF checkbook \" ) . The final bill , attached as a rider to the 1987 Defense Authorization Act , amended the Goldwater-Nichols Act and was signed into law in October 1986 . Congress clearly intended to force DOD and the Administration to face up to the realities of past failures and emerging threats . DOD and the Administration were responsible for implementing the law , and Congress subsequently had to pass two additional bills to ensure proper implementation . The legislation promised to improve SOF in several respects . Once implemented , MFP-11 provided SOF with control over its own resources , better enabling it to modernize the force . Additionally , the law fostered interservice cooperation : a single commander for all SOF promoted interoperability among the forces assigned to the same command . The establishment of a four-star Commander in Chief and an Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict eventually gave SOF a voice in the highest councils of the Defense Department . Implementing the provisions and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act , however , was neither rapid nor smooth . One of the first issues to surface was appointing an ASD ( SO / LIC ) , whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of the Department of Defense . The Congress even increased the number of assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12 , but the Department of Defense still did not fill this new billet . In December 1987 , the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD ( SO / LIC ) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate . Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD ( SO / LIC ) . Meanwhile , the establishment of USSOCOM provided its own measure of excitement . A quick solution to manning and basing a brand new unified command was to abolish an existing command . United States Readiness Command ( USREDCOM ) , with an often misunderstood mission , did not appear to have a viable mission in the post Goldwater-Nichols era , and its Commander in Chief , General James Lindsay , had had some special operations experience . On 23 January 1987 , the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to the Secretary of Defense that USREDCOM be disestablished to provide billets and facilities for USSOCOM . President Ronald Reagan approved the establishment of the new command on 13 April 1987 . The Department of Defense activated USSOCOM on 16 April 1987 and nominated General Lindsay to be the first Commander in Chief Special Operations Command ( USCINCSOC ) . The Senate accepted him without debate . = = = Operation Earnest Will = = = USSOCOM 's first tactical operation involved 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( Airborne ) ( \" Night Stalkers \" ) aviators , SEALs , and Special Boat Teams ( SBT ) working together during Operation Earnest Will in September 1987 . During Operation Earnest Will , the United States ensured that neutral oil tankers and other merchant ships could safely transit the Persian Gulf during the Iran \u2013 Iraq War . Iranian attacks on tankers prompted Kuwait to ask the United States in December 1986 to register 11 Kuwaiti tankers as American ships so that they could be escorted by the U.S. Navy . President Reagan agreed to the Kuwaiti request on 10 March 1987 , hoping it would deter Iranian attacks . The protection offered by U.S. naval vessels , however , did not stop Iran , which used mines and small boats to harass the convoys steaming to and from Kuwait . In late July 1987 , Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen , commander of the Middle East Force , requested NSW assets . Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two SEAL platoons in August . The Middle East Force decided to convert two oil servicing barges , Hercules and Wimbrown VII , into mobile sea bases . The mobile sea bases allowed SOF in the northern Persian Gulf to thwart clandestine Iranian mining and small boat attacks . On 21 September , Nightstalkers flying MH-60 and Little Birds took off from the frigate USS Jarrett to track an Iranian ship , Iran Ajr . The Nightstalkers observed Iran Ajr turn off her lights and begin laying mines . After receiving permission to attack , the helicopters fired guns and rockets , stopping the ship . As Iran Ajr 's crew began to push mines over the side , the helicopters resumed firing until the crew abandoned ship . Special Boat Teams provided security while a SEAL team boarded the vessel at first light and discovered nine mines on the vessel 's deck , as well as a logbook revealing areas where previous mines had been laid . The logbook implicated Iran in mining international waters . Within a few days , the Special Operations forces had determined the Iranian pattern of activity ; the Iranians hid during the day near oil and gas platforms in Iranian waters and at night they headed toward the Middle Shoals Buoy , a navigation aid for tankers . With this knowledge , SOF launched three Little Bird helicopters and two patrol craft to the buoy . The Little Bird helicopters arrived first and were fired upon by three Iranian boats anchored near the buoy . After a short but intense firefight , the helicopters sank all three boats . Three days later , in mid-October , an Iranian Silkworm missile hit the tanker Sea Isle City near the oil terminal outside Kuwait City . Seventeen crewmen and the American captain were injured in the missile attack . During Operation Nimble Archer , four destroyers shelled two oil platforms in the Rostam oil field . After the shelling , a SEAL platoon and a demolition unit planted explosives on one of the platforms to destroy it . The SEALs next boarded and searched a third platform 2 miles ( 3 km ) away . Documents and radios were taken for intelligence purposes . On 14 April 1988 , 65 miles ( 100 km ) east of Bahrain , the frigate USS Samuel B. Roberts ( FFG-58 ) hit a mine , blowing an immense hole in its hull . Ten sailors were injured . During Operation Praying Mantis the U.S. retaliated fiercely , attacking the Iranian frigate Sahand and oil platforms in the Sirri and Sassan oil fields . After U.S. warships bombarded the Sirri platform and set it ablaze , a UH-60 with a SEAL platoon flew toward the platform but was unable to get close enough because of the roaring fire . Secondary explosions soon wrecked the platform . Thereafter , Iranian attacks on neutral ships dropped drastically . On 18 July , Iran accepted the United Nations cease fire ; on 20 August 1988 , the Iran \u2013 Iraq War ended . The remaining SEALs , patrol boats , and helicopters then returned to the United States . Special operations forces provided critical skills necessary to help CENTCOM gain control of the northern Persian Gulf and balk Iran 's small boats and minelayers . The ability to work at night proved vital , because Iranian units used darkness to conceal their actions . Additionally , because of Earnest Will operational requirements , USSOCOM would acquire new weapons systems \u2014 the patrol coastal ships and the Mark V Special Operations Craft . = = = Somalia = = = Special Operations Command first became involved in Somalia in 1992 as part of Operation Provide Relief . C-130s circled over Somali airstrips during delivery of relief supplies . Special Forces medics accompanied many relief flights into the airstrips throughout southern Somalia to assess the area . They were the first U.S. soldiers in Somalia , arriving before U.S. forces who supported the expanded relief operations of Restore Hope . The first teams into Somalia were CIA Special Activities Division paramilitary officers with elements of JSOC . They conducted very high risk advanced force operations prior to the entry of the follow on forces . The first casualty of the conflict came from this team and was a Paramilitary officer and former Delta Force operator name Larry Freedman . Freedman was awarded the Intelligence Star for \" extraordinary heroism \" for his actions . The earliest missions during Operation Restore Hope were conducted by Navy SEALs . The SEALs performed several hydro-graphic reconnaissance missions to find suitable landing sites for Marines . On 7 December , the SEALs swam into Mogadishu Harbor , where they found suitable landing sites , assessed the area for threats , and concluded that the port could support offloading ships . This was a tough mission because the SEALs swam against a strong current which left many of them overheated and exhausted . Furthermore , they swam through raw sewage in the harbor , which made them sick . When the first SEALs hit the shore the following night , they were surprised to meet members of the news media . The first Marines came ashore soon thereafter , and the press redirected their attention to them . Later , the SEALs provided personal security for President George Bush during a visit to Somalia . In December 1992 , Special Forces assets in Kenya moved to Somalia and joined Operation Restore Hope . January 1993 , a Special Forces command element deployed to Mogadishu as the Joint Special Operations Forces-Somalia ( JSOFOR ) that would command and control all special operations for Restore Hope . JSOFOR 's mission was to make initial contact with indigenous factions and leaders ; provide information for force protection ; and provide reports on the area for future relief and security operations . Before redeploying in April , JSOFOR elements drove over 26,000 miles ( 42,000 km ) , captured 277 weapons , and destroyed over 45,320 pounds ( 20,560 kg ) of explosives . In August 1993 , Secretary of Defense Les Aspin directed the deployment of a Joint Special Operations Task Force ( JSOTF ) to Somalia in response to attacks made by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid 's supporters upon U.S. and UN forces . The JSOTF , named Task Force ( TF ) Ranger , was charged with a mission named Operation Gothic Serpent to capture Aidid . This was an especially arduous mission , for Aidid had gone underground , after several Lockheed AC-130 air raids and UN assaults on his strongholds . While Marines from the 24th MEU provided an interim QRF ( Force Recon Det and helicopters from HMM-263 ) , the task force arrived in the country , and began training exercises . The Marines were asked to take on the Aidid snatch mission , but having the advantage of being in the area for more than two months , decided after mission analysis that the mission was a \" no-go \" due to several factors , centered around the inability to rescue the crew of a downed helicopter ( re : the indigenous forces technique of using RPGs against helicopters and blocking the narrow streets in order to restrict the movement of a ground rescue force ) . This knowledge was not passed on to the Rangers , due to the Marines operating from the USS Wasp and the Rangers remaining on land . TF Ranger was made up of operators from Delta Force , 75th Ranger Regiment , 160th SOAR , SEALs from the Naval Special Warfare Development Group , and Air Force special tactics units . During August and September 1993 , the task force conducted six missions into Mogadishu , all of which were successes . Although Aidid remained free , the effect of these missions seriously limited his movements . On 3 October , TF Ranger launched its seventh mission , this time into Aidid 's stronghold the Bakara Market to capture two of his key lieutenants . The mission was expected to take only one or two hours . Helicopters carried an assault and a ground convoy of security teams launched in the late afternoon from the TF Ranger compound at Mogadishu airport . The TF came under increasingly heavy fire , more intense than during previous missions . The assault team captured 24 Somalis including Aidid 's lieutenants and were loading them onto the convoy trucks when a MH-60 Blackhawk was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade ( RPG ) . A small element from the security force , as well as an MH-6 assault helicopter and an MH-60 carrying a fifteen-man combat search and rescue ( CSAR ) team , rushed to the crash site . The battle became increasingly worse . An RPG struck another MH-60 , crashing less than 1 mile ( 1.6 km ) to the south of the first downed helicopter . The task force faced overwhelming Somali mobs that overran the crash sites , causing a dire situation . A Somali mob overran the second site and , despite a heroic defense , killed everyone except the pilot , whom they took prisoner . Two defenders of this crash site , Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randall Shughart , were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor . About this time , the mission 's quick reaction force ( QRF ) also tried to reach the second crash site . This force too was pinned by Somali fire and required the fire support of two AH-6 helicopters before it could break contact and make its way back to the base . The assault and security elements moved on foot towards the first crash area , passing through heavy fire , and occupied buildings south and southwest of the downed helicopter . They fought to establish defensive positions so as not to be pinned down by very heavy enemy fire , while treating their wounded , and worked to free the pilot 's body from the downed helicopter . With the detainees loaded on trucks , the ground convoy force attempted to reach the first crash site . Unable to find it amongst the narrow , winding alleyways , the convoy came under devastating small arms and RPG fire . The convoy had to return to base after suffering numerous casualties , and sustaining substantial damage to their vehicles . Reinforcements , consisting of elements from the QRF , 10th Mountain Division soldiers , Rangers , SEALs , Pakistan Army tanks and Malaysian armored personnel carriers , finally arrived at 1 : 55 am on 4 October . The combined force worked until dawn to free the pilot 's body , receiving RPG and small arms fire throughout the night . All the casualties were loaded onto the armored personnel carriers , and the remainder of the force was left behind and had no choice but to move out on foot . AH-6 gunships raked the streets with fire to support the movement . The main force of the convoy arrived at the Pakistani Stadium-compound for the QRF-at 6 : 30 am , thus concluding one of the bloodiest and fiercest urban firefights since the Vietnam War . Task Force Ranger experienced a total of 17 killed in action and 106 wounded . Various estimates placed Somali casualties above 1,000 . Although Task Force Ranger 's few missions were successes , the overall outcome of Operation Gothic Serpent was deemed a failure because of the Task Force 's failure to complete their stated mission , capturing Mohamed Farrah Aidid . Most U.S. forces pulled out of Somalia by March 1994 . The withdrawal from Somalia , was completed on March 1995 . Even though Operation Gothic Serpent failed , USSOCOM still made significant contributions to operations in Somalia . SOF performed reconnaissance and surveillance missions , assisted with humanitarian relief , protected American forces and conducted riverine patrols . Additionally , they ensured the safe landing of the Marines and safeguarded the arrival of merchant ships carrying food . = = = Iraq = = = USSOCOM 's 10th Special Forces Group , elements of JSOC and CIA / SAD Paramilitary Officers linked up again and were the first to enter Iraq prior to the invasion . Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion . This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam , an ally of Al Qaeda . This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat . These terrorists would have been in the subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle . Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war . This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq , but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam . This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam 's northern Army . This effort kept Saddam 's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south . This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women . At the launch of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams infiltrated southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets . Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast . Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq . It was a far cry from the Persian Gulf war of 1991 , where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines . But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan , where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting . After their star turn in Afghanistan , many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq . Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders . From that point , USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists . It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces . = = Current role = = United States Special Operations Command played a pivotal role in fighting the former Taliban government in Afghanistan in 2001 and toppling it thereafter , as well as combating the insurgency and capturing Saddam Hussein in Iraq . USSOCOM in 2004 was developing plans to have an expanded and more complex role in the global campaign against terrorism , and that role continued to emerge before and after the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 . In 2010 , \" of about 13,000 Special Operations forces deployed overseas , about 9,000 [ were ] evenly divided between Iraq and Afghanistan . \" = = = War in Afghanistan = = = In the initial stages of the War in Afghanistan , USSOCOM forces linked up with CIA Paramilitary Officers from Special Activities Division to defeat the Taliban without the need for large-scale conventional forces . This was one of the biggest successes of the global War on Terrorism . These units linked up several times during this war and engaged in several furious battles with the enemy . One such battle happened during Operation Anaconda the mission to squeeze life out of a Taliban and Al-Qaeda stronghold dug deep into the Shah-i-Kot mountains of eastern Afghanistan . The operation was seen as one of the heaviest and bloodiest fights in the War in Afghanistan . The battle on an Afghan mountaintop called Takur Ghar featured special operations forces from all 4 services and the CIA . Navy SEALs , Army Rangers , Air Force Combat Controllers , and Pararescuemen fought against entrenched Al-Qaeda fighters atop a 10,000-foot ( 3,000 m ) mountain . Subsequently , the entrenched Taliban became targets of every asset in the sky . According to an executive summary , the battle of Takur Ghar was the most intense firefight American special operators have been involved in since 18 U.S. Army Rangers were killed in Mogadishu , Somalia , in 1993 . During Operation Red Wings on 28 June 2005 , four Navy SEALs , pinned down in a firefight , radioed for help . A Chinook helicopter , carrying 16 service members , responded but was shot down . All members of the rescue team and three of four SEALs on the ground died . It was the worst loss of life in Afghanistan since the invasion in 2001 . The Navy SEAL Marcus Luttrell alone survived . Team leader Michael P. Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle . = = = Global presence = = = SOC chief Olson said in 2011 that SOCOM \" is a microcosm of the Department of Defense , with ground , air , and maritime components , a global presence , and authorities and responsibilities that mirror the Military Departments , Military Services , and Defense Agencies . \" In 2010 , special operations forces were deployed in 75 countries , compared with about 60 at the beginning of 2009 . In 2011 , SOC spokesman Colonel Tim Nye ( Army ) was reported to have said that the number of countries with SOC presence will likely reach 120 and that joint training exercises will have been carried out in most or all of those countries during the year . One study identified joint-training exercises in Belize , Brazil , Bulgaria , Burkina Faso , Germany , Indonesia , Mali , Norway , Panama , and Poland in 2010 and also , through mid-year 2011 , in the Dominican Republic , Jordan , Romania , Senegal , South Korea , and Thailand , among other nations . In addition , SOC forces executed the high profile killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011 . In November 2009 The Nation reported on a covert JSOC / Blackwater anti-terrorist operation in Pakistan . In 2010 , White House counterterrorism director John O. Brennan said that the United States \" will not merely respond after the fact \" of a terrorist attack but will \" take the fight to al-Qaeda and its extremist affiliates whether they plot and train in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Yemen , Somalia and beyond . \" Olson said , \" In some places , in deference to host-country sensitivities , we are lower in profile . In every place , Special Operations forces activities are coordinated with the U.S. ambassador and are under the operational control of the four-star regional commander . \" The conduct of actions by SOC forces outside of Iraq and Afghan war zones has been the subject of internal U.S. debate , including between representatives of the Bush administration such as John B. Bellinger III , on one hand , and the Obama administration on another . The United Nations in 2010 also \" questioned the administration 's authority under international law to conduct such raids , particularly when they kill innocent civilians . One possible legal justification \u2013 the permission of the country in question \u2013 is complicated in places such as Pakistan and Yemen , where the governments privately agree but do not publicly acknowledge approving the attacks , \" as one report put it . = = Subordinate Commands = = = = = Joint Special Operations Command = = = Joint Special Operations Command is a component command of the USSOCOM and is charged to study special operations requirements and techniques to ensure interoperability and equipment standardization , plan and conduct special operations exercises and training , and develop Joint Special Operations Tactics . It was established in 1980 on recommendation of Col. Charlie Beckwith , in the aftermath of the failure of Operation Eagle Claw . Units The U.S. Army 's 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta , popularly known as Delta Force , is the first of the two primary counter-terrorist units of JSOC and SOCOM . Modeled after the British Special Air Service , Delta Force is regarded as one of the premier special operations forces in the world . This is because of Delta 's stringent training and selection process . Delta recruits primarily from the most talented and highly skilled operators in the Army Special Forces and the 75th Ranger Regiment although Delta will take anyone and everyone that can pass their screening . Recruits must pass a rigid selection course before beginning training . Delta has received training from numerous U.S. government agencies and other tier one SOF and has created a curriculum based on this training and techniques that it has developed . Delta conducts clandestine and covert special operations all over the world . It has the capability to conduct myriad special operations missions but specializes in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue operations . The Intelligence Support Activity ( ISA , The Activity ) is the support branch of JSOC and USSOCOM . Its primary missions are to provide Human Intelligence ( HUMINT ) and Signal Intelligence ( SIGINT ) mainly for Delta and DEVGRU 's operations . Before the establishing of the Strategic Support Branch in 2001 , the ISA needed the permission of the CIA to conduct its operations , which sometimes caused it to be less effective in its support of JSOC 's primary units . The Naval Special Warfare Development Group ( DEVGRU , SEAL Team Six ) is the second of the two primary counter-terrorist units of JSOC and SOCOM . DEVGRU is Naval Special Warfare 's counterpart to Delta . Like Delta , DEVGRU recruits the best operators from the best units in its branch , the Navy SEALs . DEVGRU is capable of performing any type of special operations mission , but trains especially for counter-terrorist and hostage rescue operations . The Air Force 24th Special Tactics Squadron ( 24th STS ) is the AFSOC component of JSOC . The 24th STS usually operates with Delta and DEVGRU because of the convenience of 24th STS ability to synchronize and control the different elements of air power and enhance air operations deep in enemy territory . Portions of JSOC units have made up the constantly changing special operations task force , operating in the U.S. Central Command area of operations . The Task Force 11 , Task Force 121 , Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon 's post-11 September campaign against terrorism , and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future . Originally known as Task Force 121 , it was formed in the summer of 2003 , when the military merged two existing Special Operations units , one hunting Osama bin Laden in and around Afghanistan , and the other tracking Sadaam Hussein in Iraq . = = = Special Operations Command \u2013 Joint Capabilities = = = Special Operations Command \u2013 Joint Capabilities ( SOC-JC ) was transferred to USSOCOM from the soon to be disestablished United States Joint Forces Command in 2011 . Its primary mission was to train conventional and SOF commanders and their staffs , supports USSOCOM international engagement training requirements , and supports implementation of capability solutions in order to improve strategic and operational Warfighting readiness and joint interoperability . SOC-JC must also be prepared to support deployed Special Operations Joint Task Force ( SOJTF ) Headquarters ( HQ ) . The Government Accountability Office wrote that SOC-JC was disestablished in 2013 , and positions were to be zeroed out in 2014 . = = = Army = = = On 1 December 1989 the United States Army Special Operations Command ( USASOC ) activated as the 16th major Army command . These special operations forces have been America 's spearhead for unconventional warfare for more than 40 years . USASOC commands such units as the well known Special Forces ( SF , or the \" Green Berets \" ) and Rangers , and such relatively unknown units as the Psychological Operations Group ( PSYOP ) and Civil Affairs Brigade ( CA ) . These are one of the USSOCOM 's main weapons for waging unconventional warfare and counter-insurgency . The significance of these units is emphasized as conventional conflicts are becoming less prevalent as insurgent and guerrilla warfare increases . Units The 75th Ranger Regiment ( U.S. Army Rangers ) is the premier light-infantry unit of the United States Army and is headquartered at Fort Benning , Georgia . The 75th Ranger Regiment 's mission is to plan and conduct special missions in support of U.S. policy and objectives . The Rangers are a flexible and rapid-deployable force . Each battalion can deploy anywhere in the world within 18 hours notice . The Army places much importance on the 75th Ranger Regiment and its training ; it possesses the capabilities to conduct conventional and most special operations missions . Rangers are capable of infiltrating by land , sea , or air and direct action operations such as conducting raids or assaulting buildings or airfields . United States Army Special Forces ( SF ) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions : unconventional warfare , foreign internal defense , special reconnaissance , direct action and counter-terrorism . These missions make Special Forces unique in the U.S. military , because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum : peacetime , conflict and war . Foreign internal defense operations , SF 's main peacetime mission , are designed to help friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills , understanding of human rights issues , and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects . Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or infeasible for conventional forces . Special Forces are the U.S. military 's premier unconventional warfare force . Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers . For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons , engineering , communications and medicine . SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission . Often SF units are required to perform additional , or collateral , activities outside their primary missions . These collateral activities are coalition warfare / support , combat search and rescue , security assistance , peacekeeping , humanitarian assistance , humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations . The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment ( Night Stalkers ) headquartered at Fort Campbell , Kentucky provides aviation support to units within USSOCOM . The Regiment consists of MH-6 and AH-6 light helicopters , MH-60 helicopters and MH-47 heavy assault helicopters . The capabilities of the 160th SOAR ( A ) have been evolving since the early 1980s . Its focus on night operations resulted in the nickname , the \" Night Stalkers . \" The primary mission of the Night Stalkers is to conduct overt or covert infiltration , exfiltration , and resupply of special operations forces across a wide range of environmental conditions . 4th Military Information Support Group ( Airborne ) and 8th Military Information Support Group ( Airborne ) Soldiers use persuasion to influence perceptions and encourage desired behavior . PSYOP soldiers supports national objectives at the tactical , operational and strategic levels of operations . Strategic psychological operations advance broad or long-term objectives ; global in nature , they may be directed toward large audiences or at key communicators . Operational psychological operations are conducted on a smaller scale . 4th PSYOP Gp is employed by theater commanders to target groups within the theater of operations . 4th PSYOP Gp purpose can range from gaining support for U.S. operations to preparing the battlefield for combat . Tactical psychological operations are more limited , used by commanders to secure immediate and near-term goals . In this environment , these force-enhancing activities serve as a means to lower the morale and efficiency of enemy forces . 95th Civil Affairs Brigade ( Airborne ) specialists identify critical requirements needed by local citizens in war or disaster situations . They also locate civilian resources to support military operations , help minimize civilian interference with operations , support national assistance activities , plan and execute noncombatant evacuation , support counter-drug operations and establish and maintain liaison with civilian aid agencies and other nongovernmental organizations . In support of special operations , these culturally oriented , linguistically capable Soldiers may also be tasked to provide functional expertise for foreign internal defense operations , unconventional warfare operations and direct action missions . Sustainment Brigade ( Special Operations ) ( Airborne ) ( SBSO ( A ) ) has a difficult mission supporting USASOC . In their respective fields , signal and support soldiers provide supplies , maintenance , equipment and expertise allowing Special Operation Forces to \" shoot , move and communicate \" on a continuous basis . Because USASOC often uses Special Operations Forces-unique items , soldiers assigned to these units are taught to operate and maintain a vast array of specialized equipment not normally used by their conventional counterparts . SBSO ( A ) also provides the USASOC with centralized and integrated material management of property , equipment maintenance , logistical automation and repair parts and supplies . John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center ( USAJFKSWCS ) trains USSOCOM and Army Special Operations Forces through development and evaluation of special operations concepts , doctrines and trainings . = = = Marine Corps = = = In October 2005 , the Secretary of Defense directed the formation of United States Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command , the Marine component of United States Special Operations Command . It was determined that the Marine Corps would initially form a unit of approximately 2500 to serve with USSOCOM . On February 24 , 2006 MARSOC activated at Camp Lejeune , North Carolina . MARSOC initially consisted of a small staff and the Foreign Military Training Unit ( FMTU ) , which had been formed to conduct foreign internal defense . FMTU is now designated as the Marine Special Operations Advisor Group ( MSOAG ) . As a service component of USSOCOM , MARSOC is tasked by the Commander USSOCOM to train , organize , equip , and deploy responsive U.S. Marine Corps special operations forces worldwide , in support of combatant commanders and other agencies . MARSOC has been directed to conduct foreign internal defense , direct action and special reconnaissance . MARSOC has also been directed to develop a capability in unconventional warfare , counter-terrorism , and information operations . MARSOC deployed its first units in August 2006 , six months after the group 's initial activation . MARSOC reached full operational capability in October 2008 . Units Marine Raider Regiment ( Marine Raiders ) consists of a Headquarters Company and three Marine Raider Battalions , the 1st , 2nd and 3rd . The Regiment provides tailored military combat-skills training and advisor support for identified foreign forces in order to enhance their tactical capabilities and to prepare the environment as directed by USSOCOM as well as the capability to form the nucleus of a Joint Special Operations Task Force . Marines and Sailors of the MRR train , advise and assist friendly host nation forces \u2013 including naval and maritime military and paramilitary forces \u2013 to enable them to support their governments ' internal security and stability , to counter subversion and to reduce the risk of violence from internal and external threats . MRR deployments are coordinated by MARSOC , through USSOCOM , in accordance with engagement priorities for Overseas Contingency Operations . Marine Intelligence Battalion ( MIB ) trains , sustains , maintains combat readiness , and provides intelligence support at all operational levels in order to support MARSOF training and operations worldwide with mission-specific intelligence capability . Marine Special Operations Support Group ( MSOSG ) trains , equips , structures , and provides specially qualified Marine forces , including , operational logistics , intelligence , Military Working Dogs , Firepower Control Teams , and communications support in order to sustain worldwide special operations missions as directed by Commander , U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command ( COMMARFORSOC ) . The Marine Special Operations School ( MSOS ) performs the screening , recruiting , training , assessment and doctrinal development functions for MARSOC . It includes two subordinate Special Missions Training Branches ( SMTBs ) , one on each coast . The Special Mission Training Branch \u2014 East provide special operations training in tactics , techniques and procedures , and evaluation and certification of MARSOC forces to specified conditions and standards for SOF . The Marines of MSOS are operators with the training , experience and mature judgment to plan , coordinate , instruct and supervise development of SOF special reconnaissance and direct action skills . = = = Navy = = = The United States Naval Special Warfare Command ( NAVSPECWARCOM , NAVSOC , or NSWC ) was commissioned April 16 , 1987 , at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in San Diego as the Naval component to the United States Special Operations Command . Naval Special Warfare Command provides vision , leadership , doctrinal guidance , resources and oversight to ensure component special operations forces are ready to meet the operational requirements of combatant commanders . Today , SEAL Teams and Special Boat Teams comprise the elite combat units of Naval Special Warfare . These teams are organized , trained , and equipped to conduct a variety of missions to include direct action , special reconnaissance , counter-terrorism , foreign internal defense , unconventional warfare and support psychological and civil affairs operations . Their highly trained operators are deployed worldwide in support of National Command Authority objectives , conducting operations with other conventional and special operations forces . Units United States Navy SEALs have distinguished themselves as an individually reliable , collectively disciplined and highly skilled special operations force . The most important trait that distinguishes Navy SEALs from all other military forces is that SEALs are maritime special operations , as they strike from and return to the sea . SEALs ( SEa , Air , Land ) take their name from the elements in and from which they operate . SEALs are experts in direct action and special reconnaissance missions . Their stealth and clandestine methods of operation allow them to conduct multiple missions against targets that larger forces cannot approach undetected . Because of the dangers inherent in their missions , prospective SEALs go through what is considered by many military experts to be the toughest training regime in the world . Naval Special Warfare Development Group ( DEVGRU ) , referred to as SEAL Team Six , the name of its predecessor which was officially disbanded in 1987 . SEAL Delivery Vehicle Teams are SEAL teams with an added underwater delivery capability who use the SDV MK VIII and the Advanced SEAL Delivery System ( ASDS ) , submersibles that provides NSW with an unprecedented capability that combines the attributes of clandestine underwater mobility and the combat swimmer . Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen ( SWCC ) operate and maintain state-of-the-art surface craft to conduct coastal patrol and interdiction and support special operations missions . Focusing on infiltration and exfiltration of SEALs and other SOF , SWCCs provide dedicated rapid mobility in shallow water areas where larger ships cannot operate . They also bring to the table a unique SOF capability : Maritime Combatant Craft Aerial Delivery System \u2014 the ability to deliver combat craft via parachute drop . Like SEALs , SWCCs must have excellent physical fitness , highly motivated , combat-focused and responsive in high stress situations . = = = Air Force = = = Air Force Special Operations Command was established May 22 , 1990 , with headquarters at Hurlburt Field , Florida . AFSOC is one of the 10 Air Force Major Commands or MAJCOMs , and the Air Force component of United States Special Operations Command . It holds operational and administrative oversight of subordinate special operations wings and groups in the regular Air Force , Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard . AFSOC provides Air Force special operations forces for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified commands .

                    "text": "Titan Clydebank = Titan Clydebank is a 150-foot-high ( 46 m ) cantilever crane at Clydebank , West Dunbartonshire , Scotland . It was designed to be used in the lifting of heavy equipment , such as engines and boilers , during the fitting-out of battleships and ocean liners at the John Brown & Company shipyard . It was also the world 's first electrically powered cantilever crane , and the largest crane of its type at the time of its completion . Situated at the end of a U-shaped fitting out basin , the crane was used to construct some of the largest ships of the 20th century , including the Queen Mary , Queen Elizabeth and Queen Elizabeth 2 . The Category A Listed historical structure was refurbished in 2007 as a tourist attraction and shipbuilding museum . = = History = = The shipyard at Clydebank was created in 1871 after the company James & George Thomson moved from the Graving Docks in Govan . John Brown & Company purchased the yard in 1899 , and in 1905 , a \u00a3 24,600 order for the crane was placed with Dalmarnock based engineering company Sir William Arrol & Co . Titan was completed two years later in 1907 . It was constructed by the Scottish engineer Adam Hunter , who was working as Chief Engineer for Arrol & Co . , having served his apprenticeship on the construction of the Forth Bridge . Stothert & Pitt of Bath , England , fabricated and installed most of the machinery for the Titan , including electric motors built by Lancashire Dynamo and Motor Co . The dock was used for fitting out vessels , and the crane would lift engines and boilers into ships . The lifting capacity of the Titan , and the location of the yard at the confluence of the River Clyde and River Cart , contributed to the success of the yard as it could build extremely large ships . When tested on 24 April 1907 , Titan was the largest cantilever crane ever built with a capacity of 160 tonnes ( 160 long tons ; 180 short tons ) at a radius of 85 feet ( 26 m ) . The original lift capacity was uprated to 203 long tons ( 206 t ) in 1938 , when it became apparent that the original specification would be insufficient to install the new long range gun 's turrets into ships such as the Duke of York . On the nights of the 13 and 14 of March 1941 , the Clydebank Blitz virtually destroyed the town . 528 civilians were killed , over 617 people were seriously injured , and 48,000 civilians lost their homes . Only seven properties in Clydebank were undamaged , in one of the worst bombing raids in Britain . The raids , involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second , targeted the industry of Clydeside , but the Titan crane was undamaged . In 1968 , the yard was amalgamated into Upper Clyde Shipbuilders along with four others , in an attempt to increase competitiveness . The general elections in 1970 saw a change of government , and funding for the yard was withheld , resulting in the closure of John Brown 's . It was bought from the receivers by the Houston , Texas-based Marathon Manufacturing Company for oil rig construction . In 1980 Marathon sold the yard to the French company Union Industrielle et d \u2019 Entreprise ( UiE ) . UIE 's owners , Bouygues Offshore closed the yard in 2001 and the site was earmarked for redevelopment . Ships constructed by the crane include HMS Hood , the Queen Mary , Queen Elizabeth , Queen Elizabeth 2 , and the Royal Yacht Britannia . = = = Refurbishment = = = The crane fell into disuse in 1980s , and in the intervening period of neglect , the crane suffered vandalism to the wheelhouse and corrosion to the structure . In 1988 the crane was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure . The urban regeneration company Clydebank Re-Built started a \u00a3 3.75m restoration project in 2005 , and the crane opened to the public in August 2007 . The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust , allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting . A lift for visitors to ascend to the jib and an emergency evacuation stair were installed , along with a wire mesh around the viewing area and floodlights to illuminate the crane at night . = = Design = = The Titan used a fixed counterweight and electrically operated hoists all mounted on a rotated beam , making it faster and more responsive than its steam powered predecessors . For lifting smaller assemblies that did not require the full lifting capacity of 150 tonnes ( 150 long tons ; 170 short tons ) , a 30 tonnes ( 30 long tons ; 33 short tons ) auxiliary hoist was used , as large loads were comparatively rare . Titan is 49 metres ( 161 ft ) high , weighs about 800 tonnes ( 790 long tons ; 880 short tons ) and sits on four concrete piles sunk to a depth of 23 metres ( 75 ft ) deep . The arms of the cantilever are 45.7 metres ( 150 ft ) and 27.4 metres ( 90 ft ) long . The tower is 12 metres ( 39 ft ) square , and its centre sits just 10.7 metres ( 35 ft ) from the edge of the quay . Following the removal of the Beardmore Crane in the 1970s and the Fairfield Titan in 2007 , there are now four giant cantilever cranes on the River Clyde . The others are at Stobcross ( Finnieston Crane ) , Scotstoun ( Barclay Curle Crane ) and Greenock ( James Watt Dock Crane ) . Fewer than sixty giant cantilever cranes were built worldwide , six of them on the Clyde , and as of May 2011 , it is believed only eleven remained , four of those on the Clyde . = = Awards = = The crane was awarded the 2012 Engineering Heritage Award by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers , and described as \" a magnificent example of mechanical engineering , which forms an integral part of the local landscape \" . Titan was designated as an International Historic Civil and Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013 , the fifth such award given to a Scottish structure . For the restoration of the structure , recognition was accorded by Chicago Athenaeum Award for Architecture in 2008 and by the Civic Trust in 2009 .",

                    "text": "Kevin Clash = Kevin Jeffrey Clash ( born September 17 , 1960 ) is an American puppeteer whose characters include Elmo , Clifford , Benny Rabbit , and Hoots the Owl . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , and began performing for local TV children 's shows in his hometown of Baltimore , Maryland , as a teenager . In the early 1980s , he began working in Captain Kangaroo , and began performing in Sesame Street in 1984 . He was the fifth puppeteer to perform Elmo , the character he became the most famous for , and became an executive producer and director for the show . Clash worked in various productions for the Muppets and Jim Henson Productions and in other projects . He resigned from Sesame Street in late 2012 , after allegations of sexual impropriety , which he denied and were dismissed due to statute of limitations expiring . Clash wrote an autobiography , My Life as a Furry Red Monster , which was published in 2006 , and also featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = Early years = = Kevin Clash was born in Baltimore , Maryland , on September 17 , 1960 , the third of four children born to George Clash , a flash welder and handyman , and Gladys Clash , who ran a small daycare center in their two-bedroom , one-bath home in the Turner Station of Dundalk , Maryland . Clash developed an interest in puppetry at an early age , inspired by children 's shows like Kukla , Fran and Ollie and Sesame Street . He made his first puppet , a version of Mickey Mouse , at the age of 10 . When he was twelve , he created a monkey puppet out of the lining of his father 's coat . His first performances were for his mother 's daycare children . By the time he was a teenager , he had built almost 90 puppets , which he based upon commercials , popular music , and his friends . While still in high school , Clash performed at venues throughout Baltimore , including schools , churches , fundraisers , and community events . While appearing at a neighborhood festival , Clash was discovered by Baltimore television personality Stu Kerr , who became Clash 's first mentor and hired him to perform in the children 's show Caboose at Channel 2 . Clash also built puppets for the Romper Room franchise . When he was 17 , he contacted and met puppeteer Kermit Love , who became Clash 's mentor , after seeing Love featured in an episode of the documentary Call It Macaroni . In 1979 , on Love 's recommendation , Clash appeared as Cookie Monster in the Sesame Street float during the Macy 's Thanksgiving Parade , and met Jim Henson , who later became his boss , mentor , and friend . When he was nineteen , Clash became a puppeteer for Captain Kangaroo , initially as a guest performer , in which he also made occasional on-camera appearances . The producers of Captain Kangaroo used some of Clash 's puppet creations for the show . In 1984 , Clash had to turn down Henson 's offer to work on his film The Dark Crystal because he was working on two TV shows at the same time , Captain Kangaroo and Love 's syndicated program The Great Space Coaster , in which he was producer for the first time . = = Career = = Captain Kangaroo was cancelled in 1984 after 29 seasons , and Great Space Coaster ended , freeing up Clash to work on projects with Henson such as the film Labyrinth and Sesame Street . Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983 , mostly performing nondescript , stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets . Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl ( based on Louis Armstrong ) , the infant Baby Natasha , and inventor Dr. Nobel Price . After 1985 , Elmo , a furry red monster , became his main character . Four puppeteers , including Richard Hunt , had performed Elmo previously , but it was Clash 's development , with a falsetto voice , that established the character . He based Elmo 's character on the preschool children that attended his mother 's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents . Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz , who told Clash to always \" find one special hook \" for each character . Clash decided that the central characteristic for Elmo should be that he \" should represent love \" . After the height of Elmo 's popularity , especially the \" Tickle Me Elmo \" craze in 1996 , Clash 's responsibilities at Sesame Street increased . He recruited , auditioned , and trained its puppeteers , and became the senior Muppet coordinator , a writer , director , and co-producer of the \" Elmo 's World \" segment of the show . Clash worked with and mentored the puppeteers of Sesame Street 's international co-productions . He found working with the co-productions \" a lot of fun \" and \" very rewarding \" . He worked on the 1985 feature film Follow That Bird . In 2007 , he was promoted to senior creative adviser for the Sesame Workshop . Until 2011 , he was the sole performer as Elmo in all his public relations appearances , making his schedule , as he called it , \" crazy \" . Cheryl Henson , president of the Jim Henson Foundation , called him \" essential \" to the show . Clash worked on the first film version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , which was dedicated to Henson , in 1990 , voicing Master Splinter . He performed in several productions with Jim Henson Productions , including as the Muppet Clifford in The Jim Henson Hour ( 1989 ) , and performing the puppetry for Frank Oz 's characters ( Miss Piggy , Fozzie Bear , Sam the Eagle , and Animal ) in Muppet Treasure Island ( 1996 ) . Clash performed in the films Muppets from Space ( 1999 ) and The Muppets ' Wizard of Oz ( 2005 ) , and the TV series Muppets Tonight ( 1996 \u2014 1998 ) , in which he reprised Clifford , who served as the show 's host . He performed characters and worked behind the scenes on the sitcom Dinosaurs . In 1999 , Clash worked on a film starring Elmo , The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland . In 2006 , Clash published his autobiography , co-written by Gary Brozek and Louis Henry Mitchell , entitled My Life as a Furry Red Monster : What Being Elmo Has Taught Me About Life , Love and Laughing Out Loud . His life was featured in the 2011 documentary Being Elmo : A Puppeteer 's Journey . = = = Resignation from Sesame Workshop = = = In November 2012 , 23-year-old Sheldon Stephens alleged that he had been in a sexual relationship with Clash which began when Stephens was 16 . Sesame Workshop had initially been presented with the allegation in June , and its investigation found the allegation to be unsubstantiated . Clash acknowledged that he had been in a relationship with the accuser ; however , he characterized the relationship as being between consenting adults . Stephens later recanted his accusation , but two weeks later , another accuser , Cecil Singleton , made similar accusations and lawsuits were filed by attorney Jeffrey Herman against Clash . Clash resigned from Sesame Workshop on November 20 , 2012 , and released a statement saying , \" Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work ' Sesame Street ' is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer . I am deeply sorry to be leaving and am looking forward to resolving these personal matters privately . \" Sesame Workshop also released a statement : \" Unfortunately , the controversy surrounding Kevin 's personal life has become a distraction that none of us want , and he has concluded that he can no longer be effective in his job and has resigned from ' Sesame Street . ' \" They stated that other puppeteers had been trained to serve as Clash 's understudy and would take over his roles on the show . In July 2013 , the three cases against Clash were dismissed because the claims were made more than six years after each man reasonably should have become aware of Clash 's alleged violations during the three years after each turned 21 . Clash 's lawyers expressed his hope that the ruling would allow him to restore his personal and professional life . Lawyers for the plaintiffs appealed the ruling , alleging that the psychological effects of the abuse weren 't fully realized until 2012 . In April 2014 , the decision to dismiss the three lawsuits was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals . Months after the other alleged victims made legal accusations , Stephens filed a lawsuit in Pennsylvania against Clash , but the case ultimately was dismissed in June 2014 because the statute of limitations had ended . = = Personal life = = Clash was married for 17 years , and has a daughter who was born in 1993 . In November 2012 , Clash came out publicly as gay in response to the allegations that led to his resignation from the Sesame Workshop , stating , \" I am a gay man . I have never been ashamed of this or tried to hide it , but felt it was a personal and private matter . \" Clash is African American and has stated that although children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo , African-American adults tend to be surprised when they meet him . He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work , and that it came through in his performances . = = Awards and honors = = Clash won Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Performer in a Children 's Series for his work as Elmo on Sesame Street in 1990 , 2005 \u2013 2007 and 2009 \u2013 2013 . In all , he has won 27 daytime Emmys and one prime-time Emmy . He was the first recipient of the ' Miss Jean ' Worthley Award for Service to Families and Children given by Maryland Public Television on June 9 , 2007 . On May 19 , 2012 , Clash was presented with an honorary degree from Washington & Jefferson College .",

It dates from the 14th century , with later additions and a major restoration in the late-19th century . The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . The church was built in the Gothic style , and has historically been associated with the Stanley family of Alderley . Its major features include a fine tower , the Stanley pew which is entered by an outside staircase , a 14th-century font , the western gallery , and monuments to the Lords Stanley of Alderley . The grounds contain a 17th-century former schoolhouse , now used as a parish hall , a medieval church cross , and the Stanley Mausoleum , which dates from 1909 .

Its benefice is combined with that of St Catherine 's , Birtles . = = History = = The oldest parts of the church date from around 1300 , but it is likely that a timber-framed church existed on the site before then . The church 's original dedication was to Saint Lawrence , but that was later changed to Saint Mary . A clerestory was added in the 15th century . The tower was built in 1530 , and the Stanley pew was added in about 1600 . The west gallery , which contained an organ , was installed in 1803 . In 1856 , the chancel was completely rebuilt , to a design by Cuffley and Starkey , paid for by the Stanley family . The vestry was constructed in 1860 . The church was restored between 1877 and 1878 by Paley and Austin ; the nave floor was lowered , the pulpit was replaced , plaster was removed from the roof and the walls , and the box pews were replaced by new oak pews . The tower clock , made in 1743 , was renovated in 1997 .

The stage above this contains ringers ' windows on the north and west faces and a diamond-shaped clock on the south face . Above these the belfry windows on all faces have two lights . The top of the tower is embattled and contains the bases of eight pinnacles . Below the parapet is a string course with large grotesque gargoyles . At the west end of the nave roof is a bellcote . The Stanley pew projects to the east of the south porch . In the porch are grooves which were cut where arrows were sharpened . = = = Interior = = = The barrel-shaped nave roof dates possibly from the early 16th century . The early 17th-century Stanley pew at the eastern end of the south aisle is at the level of an upper storey , and is entered by a flight of steps from outside the church . Its front is richly carved and displays six panels with coats of arms . Richards states that it is one of the finest of its kind in the country and that it is unique in Cheshire . At the west end of the church is a late-18th-century musicians ' gallery , whose front panel has painted coats of arms . The gallery contains the organ which replaces an earlier organ . This was presented by Lady Fabia Stanley in 1875 and was made by Hill and Company of London at a cost of \u00a3 350 ( equivalent to \u00a3 30,000 in 2015 ) , An oak document chest in the tower has been dated to 1686 . The 14th-century font was buried in the churchyard during the Commonwealth , dug up in 1821 and restored to use in the church in 1924 .

Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right , five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on her lap . A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley , who died in 1878 , is by Joseph Boehm . The chancel contains a monument to Rev. Edward Shipton , rector of the church from 1625 to 1630 . The stained glass in the east window , dated 1856 , was made by William Wailes . The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co . The east window in the north aisle , dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop . The stained glass window to the left of the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill . The stained glass in the window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell , rector from 1870 to 1907 , and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877 . The tower holds a ring of six bells , hung for change ringing , five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester , and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847 . A seventh , unused , bell dates from 1686 and has been noted as being of historical importance by the Church Buildings Council of the Church of England .

Writers in the 19th century commented on the \" lofty square tower \" , the \" very good \" east window , and the \" many elegant monuments \" ; the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones called St Mary 's \" one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island \" . In the 21st century , one writer has noted the \" impressive lychgate \" and a guide to the buildings of the region calls it \" the most important church in north west Anglesey \" . The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , one of nine in a combined parish , although as of 2013 there has not been an incumbent priest since September 2009 . People associated with the church include James Williams , a 19th-century rector who was awarded a gold medal for his efforts to save lives at sea , and his great-grandson , the artist Sir Kyffin Williams . Both are buried in the churchyard . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is the parish church for the village of Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy in the north-west of Anglesey , north Wales . It is set in a churchyard at the side of a minor road , in the south-east of the village . The area is near the coast , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) from the port town of Holyhead . Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy takes its name in part from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and \" \u2011 fair \" is a modified form of the saint 's name ( Mair being Welsh for \" Mary \" ) . The parish \u2019 s coastal position is reflected in its full name , which means \" St Mary 's in the promontory \" , or \" St Mary in the angle of the waters \" . It is uncertain when the first church was constructed on the site . There was a church in Llanfair-yng-Nghornwy before 1254 , mentioned in the Norwich Taxation of that year . The oldest parts of the present structure are the nave walls and the arch between the nave and the chancel ( to the east of the nave ) ; these date from the 11th or 12th century . In the 15th century , the chancel was reconstructed and enlarged ; in the following century , a chapel was added to the south of the chancel , separated by an arcade of three arches . In her 1833 history of Anglesey , Angharad Llwyd said that the south chapel \" belongs exclusively \" to one of the local landed estates , and the chancel belonged to another . A tower was added at the west end in the 17th century , perhaps in 1660 according to a 2009 guide to the buildings of the region . At some stage , a porch was added to the south-west corner of the nave , but it has \" no datable features \" . In the middle of the 19th century the porch entrance was blocked off and replaced by a window , and since then access to the church has been through a door on the west side of the tower . Some restoration work was carried out in 1847 by the Sheffield-based architects Weightman and Hadfield . Their plans included a proposal to add a chapel to the north side , but this did not happen . Further work was undertaken in 1860 , and some repairs were carried out in the chancel and south chapel in the 1930s under the architect and historian Harold Hughes . St Mary 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales . It is one of nine churches in the combined benefice of Bodedern with Llanfaethlu . It is within the deanery of Llifion and Talybolion , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2013 , there is no incumbent priest at the church , and there has not been one since September 2009 . James Williams , rector of St Mary 's from 1821 to 1872 , helped to establish the Anglesey Association for the Preservation of Lives from Shipwreck in 1828 , in the wake of a storm that caused a boat to sink with 140 deaths . He was awarded a gold medal by the Royal National Institute for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck ( later renamed the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ) in 1835 , for his efforts in the rescue of a boat during a gale . Angharad Llwyd , writing when Williams was at St Mary 's , noted that \" this benevolent gentleman , aided by his lady , ever alert in the cause of humanity , are generally among the first on the shore , in case of accident , well supplied with restoratives , and other necessaries , to comfort and protect the suffering mariners . \" The artist Sir Kyffin Williams ( 1918 \u2013 2006 ) was a great-grandson of James and his wife Frances . At his request , a memorial to them was put up on the south wall of the chapel . James , Frances and Kyffin are buried in the churchyard . The churchyard also contains the Commonwealth war graves of a Royal Navy sailor of World War I and another from World War II . = = Architecture and fittings = = = = = Structure = = = St Mary 's is a medieval church , built using rubble masonry dressed with freestone and displaying Perpendicular details . The roof is made of slate with stone copings . Internally , the timbers of the roofs of the nave , chancel and chapel are exposed . The beams running the length of the nave are decorated at intervals by painted plaster shield designs . The chancel roof is from the late 15th century , and the chapel roof is from the early part of the following century . = = = Interior = = = The church is entered through the door at the west side of the tower , with modern double doors between the tower and the nave set into a plain square doorway dating from the 17th or 18th century . The nave is 27 feet 9 inches by 13 feet 8 inches ( 8.5 by 4.2 m ) . Between the nave and the chancel there is a plain round arch , from the 11th or 12th century , a step up , and a rail . At the east end of the chancel , there is a further step up from the chapel into the sanctuary , which has some 18th-century gravestones set into it . The late 15th-century chancel , which measures 32 feet 6 inches by 14 feet ( 9.9 by 4.3 m ) , has some memorials from the 18th and early 19th centuries . One is to a bonesetter called Evan Thomas ( died 1814 ) , erected by Thomas Bulkeley , 7th Viscount Bulkeley ; another , to Emma Viscountess Bulkeley Williams , is made from ornately decorated marble . The three arches between the chancel and chapel rest on octagonal columns . One of the arches has inscribed upon it , in early 16th-century lettering , SCA MARIA ORA PRO ME DAVID A JACO ( \" Saint Mary pray for me David ap Iago \" ) ; another has a stone with a roughly carved face . There was once a rood screen across the chancel , as shown by markings on the north wall and on the westernmost of the arches . It was still in position in 1867 , when one visitor mentioned it in his notes on the church . Panelling has been fixed to the east and south walls of the sanctuary in the chapel as a reredos . The chapel measures 32 feet 6 inches by 14 feet 6 inches ( 9.9 by 4.4 m ) . The font is at the rear of the nave on the north side . It is octagonal on the outside , with a circular bowl inside . A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded : a large silver chalice , inscribed with the donor 's name and the year 1713 ; a plain silver paten , dated 1724 \u2013 25 ; and a pewter flagon , from about 1710 . = = = Windows = = = The nave has two windows . The south window , to the east of the vestry , is from the 14th century . It has two lights ( sections of window separated by mullions ) with flat tops and is decorated with stone tracery . A survey of the church in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted the window \u2019 s \" crude workmanship and design . \" The window on the north nave wall has three lights with rounded tops . It too has been dated to the 14th century , but other sources say that it is from the 16th century . A 2009 guide to buildings of north-west Wales says that the window is \" typically 16th-century \" . The 15th-century window at the east end of the chancel has three lights topped with cinquefoils ( a pattern of five joined circles ) . The lights are decorated with tracery , and set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould . Stained glass from 1850 depicts ( from north to south ) Christ with children , Christ at a table , and the cross . The north window in the chancel is a 19th-century copy of the north nave window . There are two windows in the chapel , each with three lights ; one in the east wall from the 16th century set in an arch with a hood mould , the other in the south wall set in a flat-headed frame . = = = Tower and porch = = = The tower has external buttresses and the door on the west side is set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould . The buttresses and door were added to the tower after it was built ; the 1937 Royal Commission survey described them as \" modern \" . There are two stages ( levels ) to the tower ; the tall upper stage is slightly narrower than the base , which measures 8 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 9 inches ( 26 by 2.7 m ) . The tower has simple rectangular openings in the north , east and south walls . There is a 17th-century bell in the west wall of the tower in a plain arch opening ; the top of the wall is crenellated . Behind the parapet at the top of the tower , there is a short spire in the shape of a pyramid , made from wood and covered in slates . The south porch has been described as \" unusually long \" ; it measures 11 feet 6 inches by 8 feet 9 inches ( 3.5 by 2.7 m ) and has been used as a vestry since the external doorway was blocked off and converted into a window . The 14th-century doorway from the nave into the vestry has a pointed head in a square frame , and was described in the 1937 survey as having an \" unusual design \" . The porch roof may be from the late medieval period . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade I listed building \u2013 the highest grade of listing , designating \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" ; fewer than 2 per cent of the listed buildings in Wales are in this category . It was given this status on 12 May 1970 , as \" a fine rural parish church , incorporating significant early Medieval fabric , including a 12th-century chancel arch \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the \" good late Medieval additions , including a fine 16th-century arcaded chapel \u201d , and says that St Mary 's is of \" special interest \" because of its early date , \" and for the quality of its later detail \" . Writing in 1833 , before the restoration of 1847 , Angharad Llwyd described the church as \" a spacious ancient structure , partly in the Norman style , with a lofty square tower , of rude architecture \" . She noted the \" massive circular pillars and arches \" in the chancel , and the \" peculiar good taste \" of the architecture of the recently rebuilt rectory . The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis remarked upon the \" many elegant monuments \" in the church . Writing in 1862 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that it was \" one of the largest churches in this division of Anglesey \" He said that it had recently been \" judiciously repaired and restored \" by James Williams and was \" now one of the best specimens of an old parish church in the island \" , adding that the east window was \" good in detail and in execution \" . The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1867 . He said that the east window was \" a very good Perpendicular one of three lights , early in the style . \" He described the churchyard as \" secluded , and shaded by fine trees \" and the tower as \" rude and plain \" , noting that the \" open bell arch \" on the west side was comparable to the one at St Mary 's Church , Llanerchymedd . A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes the \" fairly large church \" as standing in a \" quiet wooded location \" . It also comments upon the \" impressive lychgate \" at the entrance to the churchyard and the \" squat pyramidal structure \" on top of the tower . A 2009 guide to the buildings of the former county of Gwynedd calls St Mary 's \" the most important church of north-west Anglesey \" and says that it has \" an unusual plan \" .",

Dedicated to Gwenllwyfo , a 7th-century female saint about whom nothing else is known , it was used as a chapel of ease for the church in Amlwch , about 5 miles ( 8 km ) away . Restored in 1610 and again in the 18th and 19th centuries , it contained an oak screen and pulpit from 1610 . It was replaced in the middle of the 19th century by a larger church about two-thirds of a mile ( 1.1 km ) away , to which some of the contents , including a memorial brass plaque from the early 17th century and the church bell , were removed ; other items were left behind . The disused church was noted to be in bad condition in 1937 , and the roof collapsed in 1950 . Little of the structure now remains , as the walls have been reduced to 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) in height . = = History and location = = The ruins of St Gwenllwyfo 's Church stand near Dulas , in the north-east of Anglesey , Wales . The date of construction of the first church on the site is unknown . There was a church here in medieval times : one 19th-century writer suggested that the present building dates from the 15th century and that the font , probably 12th century in date , was the only surviving part of an earlier church on the site . Restoration work was carried out in about 1610 and in the 18th century ; the latter changes eradicated the church 's historical details . The church ( dedicated to Gwenllwyfo , a 7th-century woman about whom nothing else is known ) was a chapel of ease attached to the parish of Amlwch , about 5 miles ( 8 km ) away . The parish tithes , however , were divided between the Bishop of Bangor and the incumbent of St Eilian 's Church , Llaneilian . The area takes its name from the church : the Welsh word llan originally meant \" enclosure \" and then \" church \" , and \" \u2011 wenllwfyo \" is a modified form of the saint 's name . In 1812 , the priest responsible for the church was Edward Hughes , whose wife was the niece of the owner of Llys Dulas , the landed estate in the area . He employed an architect to carry out some further restoration work , although the details are unknown . The church was in need of further repair by the middle of the 19th century , and the congregation needed a larger building . A new church was therefore built between 1854 and 1856 about two-thirds of a mile ( 1.1 km ) away , financed largely by the widow of William Hughes , 1st Baron Dinorben ( the son of Edward Hughes ) . The old church , which was allowed to fall into ruins , stands in a disused cemetery surrounded by trees . = = Architecture and fittings = = The nave and chancel of the church were not structurally divided , and measure 39 feet 6 inches by 15 feet 9 inches ( 12 by 4.8 m ) . The walls are 3 feet ( 0.9 m ) thick . In 1844 , it was recorded as having a coved roof , doors in the north and south walls and windows in the east , north and west walls . It also had a pulpit and an oak screen , 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) high , both dated 1610 . The screen had inscriptions in Welsh and Latin , and a note that \" Richard Williams of Rhodogeidio who married Marcelly Lloyd at his own charge caused all this worke to be don to the honor of God and his church \" . A brass plaque , erected in 1609 by Williams in memory of his wife , was moved to the new church . Another screen was later added at the west end to stop the wind blowing into the nave , and two windows were added on opposite sides of the chancel . Two box pews were installed during the 18th century , and a bell ( now used by the new church ) was added . At the time of a survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 , although the building was in bad condition with an insecure roof , it still retained an 18th-century oak communion table , a rectangular font dating from the 12th century , the 1610 screen ( damaged ) , the pulpit , fragments of an oak sounding board ( also dated 1610 ) and some 18th-century memorials . There were also stone benches along the north and south walls , and some wooden benches from the 18th or early 19th century . The medieval roof trusses were also still in place in 1937 , but the roof collapsed in 1950 . The walls have since been lowered to a height of 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) . = = Assessment = = The antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church in 1833 as \" a small neat edifice , appropriately fitted up for the performance of divine service \" . Samuel Lewis , writing in the middle of the 19th century , said that the church was \" a conspicuous and interesting object \" in a parish that \" partakes much of the general character of dreary sterility by which the mining districts in the immediate vicinity are distinguished \" . However , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones , writing in 1859 about the church as it had been 15 years earlier , said that \" the whole building was in bad repair \" . One writer described the church in the 1970s as \" a roofless , forgotten shell \" .",

                    "text": "St Mary Redcliffe = St. Mary Redcliffe is an Anglican parish church located in the Redcliffe district of Bristol , England . The church is a short walk from Bristol Temple Meads . The church building was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries , and it has been a place of Christian worship for over 900 years . The church is renowned for the beauty of its Gothic architecture and is classed as a Grade I listed building by Historic England . It was famously described by Queen Elizabeth I as \" the fairest , goodliest , and most famous parish church in England . \" Little remains of the earliest churches on the site although a little of the fabric has been dated to the `12th century . Much of the current building dates from the late 13th and 14th centuries when it was built and decorated by wealthy merchants of the city whose tomb and monuments decorate the church . The spire fell after being struck by lightning in 1446 and was not rebuilt until 1872 . Little of the original stained glass remains following damage in the English Civil War with extensive new glass being added during the Victorian era . The tower contains 15 bells designed for full-circle English-Style change ringing . Other music in the church is provided by several choirs and the Harrison & Harrison organ . = = History = = The first church on this site was built in Saxon times , as the Port of Bristol first began . In medieval times , St. Mary Redcliffe , sitting on a red cliff above the River Avon , was a sign to seafarers , who would pray in it at their departure , and give thanks there upon their return . The church was built and beautified by Bristol 's wealthy merchants , who paid to have masses sung for their souls and many of whom are commemorated there . Parts of the church date from the beginning of the 12th century . Although its plan dates from an earlier period , much of the church as it now stands was built between 1292 and 1370 , with the south aisle and transept in the Decorated Gothic of the 13th century and the greater part of the building in the late 14th century Perpendicular . The patrons included Simon de Burton , Mayor of Bristol , and William I Canynges , merchant , five times Mayor of Bristol and three times MP . In the 15th century Canynges ' grandson , the great merchant William II Canynges , also five times Mayor and three times MP , assumed responsibility for bringing the work of the interior to completion and filling the windows with stained glass . In 1446 much of this work was damaged when the spire was struck by lightning , and fell , causing damage to the interior ; however the angle of the falling masonry and the extent of the damage is unclear . Although the spire was to remain damaged for the next 400 years , Canynges continued in his commitment to restore and beautify the church . He took Holy Orders after the death of his wife , and is buried in the church . Other families associated with St Mary Redcliffe include the Penns , the Cabots , the Jays , the Ameryks and the Medes . In 1571 , the school that was to become St Mary Redcliffe and Temple School was formed in a chapel in the churchyard . The church and school have remained closely linked in many aspects of their operations . The 17th century saw the loss of many of the church fittings and much of the stained glass during the Reformation and the English Civil War . During the reign of Queen Anne , and partially funded by her , the interior of St. Mary Redcliffe was refitted in the Baroque style . Thomas Chatterton , whose father was sexton of St Mary Redcliffe , was born in the house next to the church in 1752 . He studied the church records in a room above the south porch , and wrote several works which he attempted to pass as genuine medieval documents . He committed suicide in London at the age of seventeen . In 1795 the church saw the marriages of Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Sarah Fricker and Robert Southey to Sarah 's sister Elizabeth . The upper part of the spire , missing since being struck by lightning in 1446 , was reconstructed in 1872 to a height of 292 ft ( 89 m ) . Funds for the spire rebuilding had been raised by the Canynges Society , the Friends of St Mary Redcliffe , which was formed in 1843 . They raised most of the \u00a3 40,000 needed . The 1 tonne ( 0.98 long tons ; 1.1 short tons ) capstone was laid by the Mayor , Mr William Procter Baker , at the top of the scaffolding . Because of the effect of environmental pollution on the Dundry Stone , further repairs to the spire and other stonework was needed in the 1930s . A mobile telecommunication mast is fitted inside the spire . During the Bristol Blitz in the Second World War a bomb exploded in a nearby street , throwing a rail from the tramway over the houses and into the churchyard of St Mary Redcliffe , where it became embedded in the ground . The rail is left there as a monument . = = Archives = = Parish records for St Mary Redcliffe church , Bristol are held at Bristol Record Office ( Ref . P.St MR ) ( online catalogue ) including baptism , marriage and burial registers . The archive also includes records of the incumbent , churchwardens , overseers of the poor , parochial church council , chantries , charities , estates , restoration of the church , schools , societies and vestry plus deeds , photographs , maps and plans . Records related to St Mary Redcliffe are also held at Berkeley Castle in the Muniments Room and on microfilm at Gloucestershire Archives . = = Architecture and fittings = = St Mary Redcliffe is one of the largest parish churches in England , and according to some sources it is the largest of all . The spire is also the third tallest among parish churches , and it is the tallest building in Bristol . St Mary Redcliffe is cruciform in plan , with a chapel extending to the east of the chancel , and a large 13th-century tower placed asymmetrically to the north of the west front . The tower was added to the building in the 13th century . It has broad angle buttresses and Y tracery to the windows . The bell stage has ogee gables and polygonal corner pinnacles . After the collapse of the original spire in 1446 it remained truncated until the 1870s when George Godwin rebuilt it . The nave , chancel and choir are vaulted with richly decorated with bosses in a variety of styles . The Lady Chapel has a star vault . The transepts has large pointed spandrels and a blind arcade with mullions descending from the clerestory windows . Beneath the Lady Chapel is a small crypt , with a larger one beneath the transept of three by two bays . There is a rectangular 13th century porch on either side of the nave . The north porch has an inner component dating from 1200 , with black Purbeck Marble columns , and an outer hexagonal portion built in 1325 which is ogee-cusped with a Moorish appearance . The outer polygonal part of the north porch was built in the 14th century . It has crocketed gables to the buttresses and is richly decorated with pinnacles and a quatrefoil parapet above a lierne vault . Within the church are an oak chest with caryatids dating from 1593 . The choir stalls date from the 15th century . There are two fonts ; one from the 13th century and the other made of marble by William Paty was made in 1755 . The oak pulpit was built in the 19th century by William Bennett . A wrought-iron gilded chancel screen built by William Edney in 1710 still stands under the tower . On 1 June 2016 Purcell announced they had been awarded the contract to extend St Mary Redcliffe to include visitor amenities , step-free access and a community hub . = = = Monuments and memorials = = = The church is adorned with monuments to individuals from the history of the city , including Sir William Penn ( the father of William Penn , founder of Pennsylvania ) . His helm and half-armour are hung on the wall , together with the tattered banners of the Dutch ships that he captured in battle . The church also displays a rib of a whale that John Cabot brought back from one of his voyages . The tombs of William II Canynges and his grandfather William I Canynges both have effigies on them , as does the tomb of Robert de Berkeley . There are also multiple wall monuments and brasses . = = = Stained glass = = = Little of the early stained glass remains . In the west window of St John 's Chapel , for instance , the medieval glass barely survived the destruction ( said to have been caused by Oliver Cromwell 's men ) . Most of the higher portions went untouched , but others were severely damaged . In some cases the windows were impossible to repair , and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes . The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period . William Wailes produced a design for the seven-light east window following a competition launched in 1846 ; however , delays in raising the money caused delays in its installation . Controversy over the design meant that it was replaced with the current depiction of the Crucifixion by Clayton and Bell in 1904 . The tree design in the window of the south transept was also by Wailes and was installed in 1854 . In the north transept is a memorial window to Samuel Lucas who died in 1853 , designed and installed by the St Helens Crown Glass Company which later became Pilkington . Another Wailes design depicting the Offering of the Wise Men was installed in the Lady Chapel , alongside one designed by Arthur O 'Connor . The windows in the choir aisles are by Clayton and Bell who also designed the memorial to Edward Colston which is in the north wall of the north transept . The west window was obscured by the organ until the 1860s when it was moved to make way for a depiction of the Annunciation which was designed by John Hardman Powell of Hardman & Co. and funded by Sholto Hare . Attempts to achieve some conformity with the installed work and subsequent designs lead to a further commissions for Clayton and Bell and Hardman & Co. generally as memorials to wealthy local dignitaries who had contributed to the restoration of the church . = = = Hogarth 's triptych = = = Sealing the Tomb , a great altarpiece triptych by William Hogarth , was commissioned in 1756 to fill the east end of the chancel . The churchwardens paid him \u00a3 525 for his paintings of the three scenes depicted ; the Ascension featuring Mary Magdalene , on a central canvas which is 22 feet ( 6.7 m ) by 19 feet ( 5.8 m ) . It is flanked by The Sealing of the Sepulchre and the Three Marys at the Tomb , each of which is 13 feet 10 inches ( 4.22 m ) by 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) . They are mounted in gilded frames made by Thomas Paty . This was removed from the church by mid-Victorian liturgists , before being displayed at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery ; it is now stored in the redundant church of St Nicholas , Bristol . = = The church bells = = The tower contains a total of 15 bells , one bell dating from as early as 1622 cast by Purdue and two cast by Thomas I Bilbie of the Bilbie family from Chew Stoke in 1763 , the remainder were cast by John Taylor & Co at various dates , 1903 ( 9 bells ) , 1951 ( 1 bell ) , 1969 ( 1 bell ) and 2012 ( 1 bell ) . The larger Bilbie ( 10th ) bell along with the 1622 Purdue ( 11th ) bell are included in the 50cwt ring of 12 bells . The bells are hung in a cast iron and steel H-frame by John Taylor & Co dating from the major overhaul of 1903 . A number of small modifications have taken place when each additional bell was added . The 50cwt tenor bell is the largest bell in a parish church to be hung for full-circle English-Style change ringing and the 7th-largest bell in the world , only surpassed by Liverpool Anglican Cathedral 11th ( 55cwt ) , Wells Cathedral tenor ( 56cwt ) , York Minster tenor ( 59cwt ) , St Paul 's Cathedral tenor , London ( 61cwt ) , Exeter Cathedral tenor ( 72cwt ) and Liverpool Cathedral tenor ( 82cwt ) . A new 8th bell was cast by John Taylor & Co in 2012 for the Queen 's Diamond Jubilee replacing the 1768 Bilbie bell a non-swinging bell with an internal hammer fitted for use as a service bell chimed from within the body of the church . The ring of 12 bells is augmented with two additional semitone bells . A sharp treble bell cast by John Taylor & Co in 1969 is the smallest bell in the tower and a \" flat 6th \" cast by John Taylor & Co in 1951 and allow different diatonic scales to be rung . All the bells have been tuned on a lathe ; the tenor bell was tuned in 1903 and strikes the note of B ( 492 Hz ) . The St Mary Redcliffe Guild of Change Ringers was founded in 1948 . The clock chime can be heard striking the quarter chimes on the 3rd , 4th , 5th and 8th bells of the ring of 12 with the hours being struck on the largest 50cwt ( 12th ) tenor bell . The clock chime strikes the \" Cambridge Chimes \" , commonly known as the \" Westminster Chimes \" , every quarter of an hour daily from 7 a.m. to 11pm . The chimes are disabled outside of these hours . If the bells are in the ' up ' position , the chimes are also disabled ( normally during the day on Sundays ) . The clock was fully converted to electric operation during the 1960s . It is now driven by a Smith 's of Derby synchronous motor . The old pendulum , gravity escapement and weights , etc . , were removed when the clock was automated . What remains of the clock movement and electrified chiming barrel is housed in a large enclosure in the ringing room . The clock face is approximately 3 m in diameter and is on the northern elevation . = = Choir = = The choir have released numerous recordings , as well as touring Europe and North America . = = Organ = = The first pipe organ in the church , built by Harris and Byfield in 1726 , was of three manuals and 26 stops . It was rebuilt in 1829 and again in 1867 on either side of the chancel . In 1912 a four-manual , 71-stop organ having over 4,300 pipes was installed by Harrison & Harrison . Towards the end of his life Arthur Harrison said that he regarded the organ at St Mary Redcliffe as his \" finest and most characteristic work \" . The organ remains essentially as he designed it in 1911 . Kevin Bowyer recorded Kaikhosru Sorabji 's First Organ Symphony on it in 1988 , for which the organ was an \" ideal choice \" ; the notes to the recording describe the church as \" acoustically ideal , with a reverberation period of 3 \u00bd seconds \" , and notes that the organ has \" a luxuriousness of tone \" and \" a range of volume from practically inaudible to fiendishly loud \" . William McVicker , organist at the Royal Festival Hall , has called the organ \" the finest high-Romantic organ ever constructed \" . November 2010 saw the first performances on the organ after an 18-month renovation by its original builders Harrison & Harrison , costing around \u00a3 800,000 . The organ had been disassembled and some of it taken away to the builders ' workshop in Durham . The pipes were cleaned and the leather of the bellows was replaced . The manuals were also fitted with an electronic panel for storing combinations of stop settings . = = = Organists , choirmasters and directors of music = = = There is no record of the names of some of the early organists ; however there is a record of several payments to Mr Nelme Rogers for playing the organ in the 1730s . Rogers had a long tenure from 1727 when a new organ was installed until 1772 , when John Allen took over . Cornelius Bryan served as the organist from 1818 until 1840 . He was followed by Edwin Hobhouse Sircom until 1855 and then William Haydn Flood until 1862 . For the next hundred years the post of organist was combined with that of choirmaster and was held by : Joseph William Lawson 1862 \u2013 1906 , Ralph Thompson Morgan 1906 \u2013 1949 , Kenneth Roy Long 1949 \u2013 1952 and Ewart Garth Benson 1953 \u2013 1968 , who continued as the organist until 1987 . From 1967 a choirmaster was appointed . The post was held by : Peter Fowler 1968 , Bryan Anderson 1968 \u2013 1980 and John Edward Marsh 1980 \u2013 1987 . From 1987 the title of the post was Director of Music and organist , with the post being held by : John Edward Marsh 1987 \u2013 1994 , Anthony John Pinel 1994 \u2013 2003 and Andrew William Kirk since 2003 . The assistant organists have been : John Edward Marsh 1976 \u2013 1980 , Colin Hunt 1980 \u2013 1990 , Anthony John Pinel 1990 \u2013 1994 , Graham Alsop 1994 \u2013 2003 and Graham and Claire Alsop from 2003 .",

                    "text": "St George 's Church , Trotton = St. George 's Church is an Anglican church in Trotton , a village in the district of Chichester , one of seven local government districts in the English county of West Sussex . Most of the structure was built in the early 14th century . However , some parts date to around 1230 , and there is evidence suggesting an earlier church on the same site . In 1904 , a largely intact and unusually detailed painting was found on the west wall depicting the Last Judgment as described in Matthew 25 : 31 \u2013 46 . The church is dedicated to St. George , patron saint of England . The rector of St George 's also oversees the parish of Rogate with Terwick , and most services are held at St. Bartholomew 's church in Rogate : just two services a month take place at Trotton . The church is also used once a month by the British Orthodox Church . The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building for its architectural and historical importance . = = History = = Historians have disagreed about its age , and the existence of an older church on the same site . The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240 , but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and the body of the church both date to the 14th century . The porch appears to be a 17th century addition . There is a tomb of Margaret de Camois in the nave . It has been suggested that its location there , rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor ( which her surname suggests she was ) , may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier , smaller , church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church . Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees , saying there would be no need for a church on the site any earlier . A comprehensive restoration was undertaken by Philip Mainwaring Johnston in 1904 . The work cost \u00a3 700 ( \u00a3 68,000 as of 2016 ) , and a time capsule containing details of the builders , church officials and contemporary world events was buried at the end of the job . = = Description and architecture = = The church is situated in the village of Trotton , West Sussex , just off the A272 near the River Rother . It stands between the early 15th-century bridge over the river and the 16th-century manor house . The church has a plain , simple Decorated-style exterior , apart from the tower which is Early English style . The nave and chancel are in a single chamber , separated by a narrow step instead of a chancel arch . The tower stands at the western end of the church , and contains a ring of four bells hung for change ringing . The tenor ( largest ) bell dates from 1908 , the others from 1913 ; all were cast by John Taylor & Co . The church is built of rubble with ashlar dressings . The roof of the main body is tiled ; during the 14th century it had a thatched roof , but this was replaced in about 1400 . The tower roof is a shingled octagonal cap . = = Wall paintings = = In 1904 , the whitewash was removed from the west wall and a wall painting from the very early days of the church was discovered . This , in itself , is not remarkable . Plenty of early churches have wall paintings ; however , this one was unusually rich and detailed . In the centre is Jesus Christ , beneath him is Moses and on his right is the \" Carnal Man \" surrounded by the Seven Deadly Sins . On his left is the \" Spiritual Man \" surrounded by the Seven Acts of Mercy . These two characters are depicted on the opposite sides of Christ than is usual in such depictions of the Last Judgement . The red paintwork is mostly in good condition , although the Seven Deadly Sins have started to fade . There are also paintings on the north and south walls depicting the Camoys family . Camoys was the lord of the manor and it appears he had the church built primarily for his family . This would explain the unusual detail in the paintings . They were intended as rich decoration rather than simply for educating an illiterate congregation . = = Tombs = = A 9-foot ( 2.7 m ) table-tomb in the middle of the chancel contains the remains of Thomas de Camoys , 1st Baron Camoys ( died 1421 , although the inscription says 1419 ) and his wife , Elizabeth , daughter of Edmund Mortimer , 3rd Earl of March . Baron Camoys fought at the Battle of Agincourt , and his wife was the inspiration for the character of Gentle Kate in William Shakespeare 's play Henry IV . The sides of the brass memorial are decorated with quatrefoil- and shield-shaped ornamentation , which enhance the comparatively plain figures . The baron and baroness are depicted holding hands and only slightly smaller than life-size . Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner described the memorial as \" one of the biggest , most ornate and best preserved brasses in England \" . The nave contains a leger slab with a brass of Margaret de Camois ( died 1310 ) . This is the oldest known brass of a woman in England . There used to be a 15th-century niche-tomb in the south wall , but it had been largely removed by 1780 . The table-tomb of Sir Roger Lewknor ( died c . 1478 ) is in the northeast corner of the chancel . Its sides have festoon motifs and slender carved niches . In the southeast corner is the pilastered tomb of Anthony Foster ( died 1643 ) . = = The church today = = St George 's Church was listed at Grade I on 18 June 1959 . Such buildings are defined as being of \" exceptional interest \" and greater than national importance . As of February 2001 , it was one of 80 Grade I listed buildings , and 3,251 listed buildings of all grades , in the district of Chichester . The present ecclesiastical parish of Trotton covers a large north \u2013 south area of countryside , includes the village of Trotton and the hamlets of Chithurst and Ingrams Green , and is served by St Mary 's Church at Chithurst as well as St George 's . Both churches are in the Rural Deanery of Midhurst , one of eight deaneries in the Archdeaconry of Horsham in the Diocese of Chichester . Eucharistic services are held on the second and fourth Sundays every month . The church is open during the day for visitors .",

The Grade I listed building is between West Pennard and West Bradley in the English county of Somerset . The barn was restored by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings in the 1930s following the collapse of the roof and then given to the National Trust . At 50 feet ( 15 m ) long and 20 feet 6 inches ( 6.25 m ) wide it is the smallest of the barns associated with the abbey . It has a cruck braced timber framed roof and is supported by two-stage buttresses . = = History = = The barn which was originally known as Parson 's Barn , was built on the orders of the Abott of Glastonbury Abbey in the late 14th or early 15th century . There is no written record of the exact date and there is some debate about the likely age of the building based on the architectural features . Along with several others barns it was used to collect the tithes or dues to the abbey , often one tenth of a farm 's produce . It fell within the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides which was named after the hides who gave food rent to Glastonbury Abbey . The West Pennart Court Barn is the smallest of those which survive . A survey in 1932 found that the roof was cracked and it eventually collapsed in 1935 . In 1936 the roof structure was straightened , preserving the medieval trusses where possible , and covered with clay tiles . The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings , with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for \u00a3 5 . It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938 . Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961 . A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate . = = Architecture = = The rectangular five bay barn is 50 feet ( 15 m ) long and 20 feet 6 inches ( 6.25 m ) wide , although it was previously larger . The middle bay is slightly longer than the others because of the central porches . The barn is built of local Blue Lias stone with some better quality oolitic ashlar used for the quoins on the corners and the porches which provided cover for gfoods being loaded and unloaded at the doors . It is supported by two-stage buttresses reaching to three quarters of the height of the walls . Each of the side walls has ventilation slits , or breathers , with those in the end walls being in the shape of a cross pommee . The barn originally had an attached dovecote on the western end , and still has niches for birds inside the barn and on the east gable wall . The dovecote was adapted into a calf shed . The roof was originally thatched but now is tiled , and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal trusses . The design of the roof is similar to that in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton , Manor Farm , Doulting and Glastonbury itself , which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum . The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof .",

It was originally a chapel of ease for the parish church of St Peulan 's , Llanbeulan , but the township that it once served , Tal-y-llyn , no longer exists . It was declared a redundant church in the early 1990s , and has been in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches since 1999 . Services are held once per month during part of the year .

It is a Grade I listed building , a national designation given to buildings of \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" , because it is \" a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple , rustic character . \" = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is in a rural and thinly populated part of Anglesey , about 4.25 kilometres ( 2.6 mi ) northeast of Aberffraw and about 3.75 kilometres ( 2.3 mi ) southwest of Gwalchmai . It stands on a low mound with a circumference of approximately 120 yards ( 110 m ) ; the wall around the churchyard , which contains no gravestones , follows the shape of the mound to some extent . Its original purpose was to serve as one of five chapels of ease for the local parish church , St Peulan 's , Llanbeulan , about 1.5 miles ( 2.4 km ) to the north ; St Peulan 's itself has now closed . The township that St Mary 's served , Tal-y-llyn , has now disappeared , although before the time of the Black Death there were 22 houses here . The date of foundation of the church is unknown . The nave is the oldest part of the church , possibly built in the 12th century . Later changes saw the rebuilding of the chancel ( in the late 16th century ) and the addition of a chapel on the south side of the building ( in the 17th century ) . It was used for services until the early 1990s , and was then made a redundant church in about 1992 . It was placed in the care of the Friends of Friendless Churches in 1999 , who hold a 999 year lease effective from 19 November 1999 . Services are held in the church on one Sunday afternoon per month between May and October . = = Architecture and fittings = = The church was constructed using rubble masonry with boulder quoins . The floor is laid with flagstones throughout , and the roof has modern slates . The nave measures 25 by 13 feet ( 7.6 by 4.0 m ) , the chancel measures 16 feet 6 inches by 11 feet ( 5.03 by 3.47 m ) , and the chapel adjoining the chancel on the south side is 9 by 8 feet ( 2.7 by 2.4 m ) . Between the nave and chancel is a pointed arch , with some 13th-century elements but probably reconstructed in the 16th century . The side chapel has rectangular windows in the east and west walls from the 17th century ; a narrow stone bench runs along the west and south walls of the chapel . The roof trusses , which date from the 15th and 17th centuries , are visible inside the building and the undersides are chamfered . There are two rectangular windows in the north wall of the nave ( 20th century additions ) , matching the window in the north wall of the chancel . The east window , in the chancel , has three rounded lights set in a square frame ; it dates from the latter part of the 16th century . The windows still have their clear leaded glass but are now boarded up . There are no windows on the south side , which is the most exposed side . There is an empty bellcote on the roof at the west end of the nave . The entrance is also at the west end , where there is a rounded arch doorway set deep into the thick wall , possibly dating from the 14th century . The 12th-century font was removed when the church was made redundant ; it is now in the nearby church of St Maelog , Llanfaelog . The church now houses a 15th-century octagonal font made of gritstone , positioned on an octagonal stem . The communion rails are dated 1764 and is of a simple design ; the pulpit , also 18th-century , has recessed panels . There are stone benches along the north and south walls of the nave . Many of the pews , which dated from the 18th century , were vandalised or stolen after the church was made redundant . Replacements were made by a local craftsman as part of the restoration project carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the Friends of Friendless Churches . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade I listed building \u2013 the highest grade of listing , designating buildings of \" exceptional , usually national , interest \" . Fewer than 2 % of the listed buildings in Wales are in this category . It was given this status on 5 April 1971 , because it is \" a very rare example of a virtually unrestored Medieval church of simple , rustic character . \" Cadw ( the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also note as a reason for listing \" the retention of a complete set of 18th century fittings , including simple benches \" , although this comment predates the 1990s vandalism . One modern guide to the buildings of the region comments that it has \" the vernacular character of Anglesey 's country buildings , which survives scarcely at all in the churches . \" The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis , however , took a different view of the building , calling it \" a small edifice of no interest \" .",

The date of construction is unknown , but is probably from some time between the 12th to 14th centuries . A church dedicated to St Mary was recorded here in 1254 , but there is a tradition that there was an older church dedicated to St Geraint , an early British saint . Some medieval stonework remains in three walls of the building ( the west wall , and parts of the north and south walls ) . A chapel was added to the south side in the 16th or 17th century . The church was altered and refurbished during the 19th century , including an extensive rebuilding by Henry Kennedy , the architect for the Diocese of Bangor , in 1882 . St Mary 's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales , and is one of three churches in a combined parish . Its conservation is specifically included in the aims of a Chester-based charity that promotes health and the arts in Anglesey and the north-west of England . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" , in particular because of the retention of medieval fabric in a predominately 19th-century building , and its \" fine \" memorials . It is built from rubble masonry with a slate roof , and part of a font thought to date from the 12th century has been reused as a water basin in the porch . St Mary 's has a number of memorials from the 18th and 19th centuries , some commemorating residents of a nearby manor house . There was once a tradition of decorating the interior with paper garlands , although writers differ on whether this was to celebrate parishioners ' weddings or to mark the death of unmarried women . It was one of only two churches in Anglesey included by the 18th-century writer Francis Grose in his multi-volume guide to English and Welsh antiquities . = = History and location = = St Mary 's Church is in the middle of Pentraeth , Anglesey , about 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) from the town of Menai Bridge . It is situated at the junction of the A5025 and the B5109 roads . The date of the foundation of the first religious building on this site is unknown . There is a tradition that there was originally a church here dedicated to St Geraint , an early British saint , since the old name for the village was Llanfair-Bettws-Geraint . However , a Pentraeth church dedicated to St Mary was recorded in the Norwich Taxation of 1254 . The present building probably dates from sometime between the 12th and the 14th centuries , with the nave and chancel being medieval in origin . A chapel was added to the south side of the parish church at the end of the 16th century or the early part of the 17th century . A restoration of the interior took place in 1821 with further changes in 1839 . Henry Kennedy , the architect of the Diocese of Bangor , oversaw a partial but extensive rebuilding in 1882 , which included reconstruction of the east wall and the addition of the porch on the south side . He also added an internal arch to mark the sanctuary as part of rebuilding or extending of the chancel . A reredos and some other fittings were added in the first part of the 20th century . St Mary 's is still in use for worship and belongs to the Church in Wales . It is one of three churches in the combined benefice of Llanfair Mathafarn Eithaf with Llanbedrgoch with Pentraeth . The church is in the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai , the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor . As of 2012 , the position of rector is held by the Venerable R P Davies , Archdeacon of Bangor . The \" conservation , protection and improvement \" of St Mary 's are included in the aims of the Tyrer Charitable Trust , a Chester-based charity that promotes health and the arts in Anglesey and north-west England ; it is the only church so specified in the charity 's aims and objectives . = = Architecture and fittings = = The church is built from irregularly positioned pieces of rubble masonry , and Kennedy added red sandstone dressings in his 1882 work . The nave measures 50 feet 3 inches long by 17 feet 3 inches wide ( about 15.3 by 5.3 m ) ; the chancel is the same width , and about 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) long . The chapel is 17 feet by 20 feet 6 inches ( about 5.2 by 6.25 m ) . There is medieval masonry in three of the walls : the west wall , and the lower parts of the north and south walls . The roof is made of slate , with a stone bellcote containing one bell at the west end . Inside , the wooden trusses of the roof are visible . The trusses were re-used when the roof was reconstructed . The church is entered through a porch on the south side , added in the 19th century , and a Tudor arch doorway ; the porch contains a stone piscina ( a water basin ) , said to be part of a font dating from the 12th century . An old entrance in the north wall of the nave has been blocked up . Two of the three windows in the north wall are from the 19th century . The third , nearest to the east end , is from the early 17th century and has a square frame . The eight-sided font also dates from the 19th century . The 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire also recorded the existence of an oak poor box , with iron straps , bearing the date of 1740 , and a plain silver cup from about 1685 . The chancel and the south chapel are each separated from the nave by arches ; the chancel arch , which was added by Kennedy in 1882 , is decorated with carvings of an eagle on one side and a lamb on the other . Steps lead up from the nave to the chancel , with a further step marking the sanctuary . The east window dates from the late 14th or the early 15th century , although it has been rebuilt , with three lights ( vertical sections separated by mullions ) . These are topped with tracery ( decorative stone work ) and cinquefoils ( a five leaf pattern ) . It contains stained glass depicting St Mary and St John , added in 1890 . The east window in the chapel is of similar design to the 17th-century window in the north wall of the nave , and dates from the late 16th or early 17th century ; restoration work has been carried out on it . The south window has a pointed arch with two lights topped by cinquefoils ; it is above a sill for an older window . There is also a window in the west wall of the chapel . St Mary 's contains a number of memorials from the 18th and 19th centuries . Members of the families associated with Plas Gwyn , a nearby manor house , have their memorials in the chapel . John Jones , who was Dean of Bangor Cathedral from 1689 to 1727 , was born at Plas Gwyn , and is commemorated with a stone tablet on the south wall of the chancel . Another native of Pentraeth , the cleric and writer Thomas Owen , who died in 1812 , also has a tablet in the chancel . Charles Vivian , 2nd Baron Vivian ( who died in 1886 ) , and his wife Mary are remembered with a bronze tablet on the east wall of the chapel . There are other memorials on the walls of the chapel and the nave . The south window of the chapel has stained glass in memory of Claud Panton Vivian , of Plas Gwyn , who died at the age of 24 during the Second World War . The churchyard has a number of graves for members of the Vivian family , and their plot contains \" four beautifully-carved Celtic crosses . \" The churchyard also contains two Commonwealth war graves , of a South Lancashire Regiment soldier of World War I and a Royal Navy sailor of World War II . The church used to be decorated with paper garlands . This tradition was noted in the 18th century , when a writer thought that they symbolised the \" hymeneal union \" ( i.e. marriage ) of parishioners , because the garlands each had a pair of hands in the centre . In 1833 , another writer said that the garlands marked the death of unmarried women , but the tradition was no longer observed . = = Assessment = = St Mary 's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building \u2013 the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating \" buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them \" . It was given this status on 30 January 1968 , and has been listed because it is \" a predominantly late 19th-century church which retains some Medieval fabric \" . Cadw ( the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes \" some fine 18th-century and 19th-century memorials . \" The 18th-century writer Francis Grose , who wrote a multi-volume guide to the antiquities of England and Wales , included St Mary 'a in his survey of Anglesey , one of only two churches on the island that he featured ( the other being St Cybi 's , Holyhead ) . He said that this \" little edifice is more remarkable for its simplicity , and the beauty of the rural scene by which it is surrounded , than for any matters of antiquity or curiosity in its construction , or contained within its walls \" . The Welsh antiquarian Angharad Llwyd and the writer Samuel Lewis ( both writing in the 19th century before the 1882 alterations ) each described St Mary 's as a \" small neat edifice \" . They particularly noted the internal and external monuments to members of various local families . Writing in 1847 , the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that St Mary 's was \" remarkable for being in one of the sweetest spots in the isle of Anglesey \" The interior , he said , was \" greatly blocked up with pews \" , but was in \" excellent repair \" , with \" a degree of neatness and comfort about it quite unusual in this district . \" The roof timbers , he commented , were \" closely set together , light in section , but producing a good effect . \" The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited a couple of years later , in 1849 . He described St Mary 's as being in a \" pretty \" situation , \" surrounded by trees \" . He noted the \" fair \" east window and the \" rude timber framework \" of the roof . In 2006 , a guide to the churches of Anglesey noted that the red sandstone used in the windows and in the bellcote was showing signs of \" severe weathering \" in places .",

Founded in 1840 , on land donated by Elizabeth Underwood , the church building is the oldest authenticated surviving building in Ashfield , having been built at the time when subdivision increased the population density sufficiently to turn Ashfield into a town . It was also the first church built along the Parramatta Road which linked the early colonial towns of Sydney and Parramatta . The earliest remaining parts of the building are one of the first Sydney designs by the colonial architect Edmund Blacket , who later became renowned for his ecclesiastical architecture . The expansive church grounds contain a cemetery dating back to 1845 that contains the remains of many notable Ashfield residents . Australia 's only memorial to Australian Air Force Cadets occupies a prominent position near the entrance to the church . The St John 's site has been listed on the Local Environment Plan Heritage Schedule , and the Register of the National Trust of Australia . St John 's is one of three churches , along with St Albans , Five Dock , and St Oswald 's , Haberfield , which make up Christ Church Inner West , operating within the parish of Ashfield , Five Dock , and Haberfield , as part of the South Sydney Region of the Anglican Diocese of Sydney . The church has had 18 rectors , including William George Hilliard who later became the Bishop of Nelson . Andrew Katay has been rector since early 2005 . = = History = = St John 's was the first church to be established along Parramatta Road between the colonial towns of Sydney and Parramatta ( then known as Rose Hill ) , during a time of rapid church building when many of the oldest churches in Sydney were erected . Since 1810 the Parish of Ashfield had extended from Balmain to Strathfield , and from Enfield to the Parramatta River , and in 1840 this was formalized into an ecclesiastical district . = = = Early contributors = = = The first portion of grounds , an area of 1 acre , 2 roods , and 36 perches ( a total of 0.698 ha ) , was provided as a gift by the local landowner Elizabeth Underwood who was subdividing \" Ashfield Park \" . The Bishop of Australia , William Grant Broughton added urgency by expressing his \" intention of having a Place of Worship erected immediately , on the allotment of land appropriated for that purpose \" . Another benefactor was William Bland , a doctor and politician who had been sent to the colony having been convicted of manslaughter after pistol duel which left his opponent mortally wounded , and after whom Bland street is named . He gave a donation of \u00a3 200 and land . Fellow local medical practitioner , James Bowman , contributed a \" similarly munificent donation \" . By mid-1839 the funds received were thought to be sufficient to commence building . The exact location was determined in February 1840 , and appeals continued to fund a building of sufficient size for the surrounding population . = = = Church building = = = The church was founded on 9 September 1840 . The service on that day was read by the first rector , Joseph Kidd Walpole , who had come to the district from Christ Church , Kelso , and had begun to plan the church building . W. G. Broughton made an address at the ceremony . The anniversary sermon was preached by Robert Allwood . This Foundation Stone of a church dedicated to the honor and worship of Almighty God ! and to be denominated ' The Church of St. John the Baptist ' was laid the 9th day of September , 1840 . By the Right Reverend Father in God William Lord Bishop of Australia In the Fourth Year of the reign of Queen Victoria . Sir George Gipps , Knight . Governor . Rev. Joseph Kidd Walpole , Minister . Among those that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet than John the Baptist ; but he that is last in the Kingdom of God is greater than he . Luke vii , 28 . Building work on the church began in 1841 , but construction came to a standstill due to construction problems and insufficient subscriptions . The following year the colonial architect Edmund Blacket , as one of his first assignments after arriving in Sydney , was requested to inspect the church 's walls , then still under construction . As a result of his report , the walls were demolished and re-erected , although continued funding problems , and the transfer of J. K. Walpole to Windsor caused further delays . The church was licensed for operation on 1 October 1843 . Much of the interior woodwork was carved by the third rector , Frederick Wilkinson . The roof was strengthened in around 1845 by the installation of timber support columns . On 16 August 1845 , at a cost of \u00a3 100 the church purchased an additional 2.5 acres ( 1.0 ha ) of land from Elizabeth Underwood ( who remained a parishioner until her death , and is buried in a prominent grave within the church cemetery ) . The church was eventually consecrated on 19 August 1845 . After 29 years , as the Bishop of Sydney Frederic Barker put it \" the population of Sydney had invaded these sylvan shades \" , so an expansion was required . Blacket designed the current stone transept and chancel , to transform the church into a cruciform plan . These were built during the period 1874 \u2013 1875 at a cost of around \u00a3 150 \u2013 raised without the help of grants from the government or the English societies . The foundation stone of the addition was laid by Barker on 24 October 1874 , and included a copy of Australian Churchman and the Sydney Morning Herald . At the time this addition accommodated an extra 250 seats , bringing the total capacity to 446 . Construction of the choir vestry and a wooden porch outside the western door were completed in 1885 , and dedicated by Bishop Alfred Barry . This work was overseen by the Blacket brothers , who had followed the trade of their late father . Arthur Blacket then designed the west tower . The eight-bell peal was ordered from England after a generous bequest by one of the \" Melanesian boys \" , David Marguay , and subsequent fundraising . The tower was then quickly constructed at a cost of around \u00a3 250 in memory of the recently deceased rector James Christian Corlette , and dedicated as The Corlette Memorial Tower on 1 November 1901 . The memorial bells proved depressing amongst the local populace , and were rearranged in 1904 , with louvres added to the previously open arches . This was apparently ineffective , as the bells were removed within a few years . = = = Music = = = Prior to the installation of a pipe organ , a seraphine and then an harmonium were used for musical accompaniment . The first organ was installed above the gallery at the western end of the church by William Davidson at the request of the rector J. C. Corlette , and was transferred to the south transept in about 1879 , where it remained until 1882 when it was sold to St Bartholomew 's , Pyrmont , and later St Luke 's , Northmead . The 1883 Hill and Son organ , including 844 pipes , costing a total of \u00a3 550 , was installed in 1884 , and located in the north-east corner of the transept . It is still in use , with original pipework , making it faithful to the original tones . The organ was refurbished and rebuilt in 1950 , 1975 , and 2008 . The 1950 change from mechanical to electrical action was motivated by removing the increasingly noisy pedals and trackers . This refurbishment also included detachment of the console ( to the other side of the transept ) , and replacement of the bellows with a \" pressure equaliser \" . The fa\u00e7ade pipes were sprayed to a dull gold colour , covering over the original diapering , described disparagingly at the time as \" all over the pipes without much rhyme or reason ; fleurs-de-lys in profusion , dots , bands , triangles in all the colours of the rainbow rioted in confusion \" . This work was carried out by R. A. and D. A. Wiltshire . By 1975 the organ had become unplayable , and a reconversion to mechanical action was undertaken . The console was moved back to the organ side of the transept , with the action going backward under the floor into the organ . This necessitated removal of floor joists and foundation piers , but the unsupported floor caused further problems long term , and during the 2008 rebuild it was re-electrified . Between 2006 \u2013 2008 Sydney firm \" John W Parker \u2013 Pipe Organ Builders \" refurbished the organ , returning the soundboard action to electric , providing a new roll-top ' detached ' console , and an entirely new wind supply and bellows . The swell box which had been discarded in the 1975 rebuild was reinstated , and the pedal Bourdon 16 ' stop was extended to 8 ' pitch . Octave couplers were provided in Sub and Octave pitches on the Swell also . All manual pipework was washed , cleaned and regulated to original Hill standards and tonality . The church had a significant choral history , with significant events often celebrated with a full choir , sometimes accompanied by an orchestra . In the late 19th century the St John 's choir participated in regional choir festivals . = = = Site development = = = A small hall for Sunday school was erected in 1865 by the generosity of L. H. Smythe . By 1895 the hall had fallen into disrepair , and the needs of the children had outgrown it . The current Parish Hall was planned to replace it . The memorial stone for the replacement building was laid by the Primate of Australia , William Saumarez Smith in inclement weather on 2 February 1895 . The architect was E. A. Scott , and his building design was of a \" domestic style ... with a highly decorated front \" . It cost \u00a3 625 10s , was complete within three months , and seated up to 400 . However , by 1903 , the Sunday school had once again outgrown the space available , and an additional infants classroom was built nearby . This is now called the Small Hall , and is used as a classroom for the St John 's Preschool . A rectory was first provided for the rector J. C. Corlette and his large family in 1879 . A block of land , located on what is now the corner of Rectory Avenue and Alt Street , was purchased for \u00a3 444 , and the foundation stone was laid by Bishop Barker in 1880 . This original rectory was sold in 1922 for \u00a3 1800 . The current rectory , on the main grounds of the church , was founded by Archbishop John Charles Wright in the same year , during the rectorship of William George Hilliard , and built at a cost of \u00a3 2500 . Gravel pathways lined with Phoenix canariensis palms , the lawn in front of the church , and the stone churchyard fence were also constructed in the 1920s . The Alt Street wall was erected in 1922 , and dedicated to the previous rector Alfred Yarnold . The Bland Street wall was dedicated in 1927 by Archdeacon Davies , and commemorates one of the key contributors , R. A. Forsaith . The cemetery , which had been in existence since soon after the foundation of the church ( the first interment was Frederick Underwood , Elizabeth 's 11-month-old grandson , on 1 May 1845 ) , was consecrated by the Archbishop of Sydney , Howard West Kilvinton Mowll , on 8 September 1934 . By this stage it reportedly already contained the remains of 1,396 people . He was asked by the rector of the time to \" set apart the area , containing 4 acres and 4 perches ( 1.63 ha ) , as a burial-place for the bodies of Christian people living in and about Ashfield \" . Australia 's only memorial to Australian Air Force Cadets occupies a prominent position on the grounds , and a memorial service attended by the Cadets has been held annually since it was opened by the State Governor Lieutenant General John Northcott in 1946 . It was built by Squadron Leader Arthur Whitehurst who had commanded a squadron at Ashfield during the period 1941 \u2013 1946 , and whose son Douglas Arthur Whitehurst had died in action in World War II . A children 's playground was installed near the Alt St boundary in 2011 , and opened by Ashfield Municipal Council Mayor Ted Cassidy and Strathfield MP Charles Casuscelli . = = = Regional influence = = = A number of local street names were derived from the presence of St John 's . Church Street , which ends directly opposite the church entrance , was originally the track used by Burwood residents to reach the church , using a conveniently located fallen tree across Iron Cove Creek . As the population of Sydney 's Inner West grew , many of the Anglican churches in the area were established by the congregation of St John 's ( including four during the final thirty years of the nineteenth century ) . These include Balmain , Burwood , Five Dock , St Thomas ' Enfield ( declared a separate parish in 1868 ) , and St Oswald 's Haberfield ( 1908 ) . Because of this involvement , St John 's was later referred to as the \" Mother Church of Western Suburbs \" . = = = Rectors = = = St. John 's has had eighteen rectors to date . Joseph Kidd Walpole was the first rector , during the period 1840 \u2013 1842 . He was originally from England , and went on mission to Madras in 1836 , but his health gave way , and he was transferred to New South Wales . He was ordained as a Deacon in 1936 , and as a Priest in 1937 . After disappointing progress on the building , he was transferred to Richmond after two years . William Stone , B.A. was the rector during the period 1842 \u2013 1843 . He grew up in a clerical family in Ireland , married his first cousin , and had nine children , seven of whom joined their parents on the journey to Australia in 1841 . When appointed at St John 's , he set aside a room in their family home , deemed by the Bishop as temporarily licensed as a place of worship since the church was not yet complete . At the time he was also the minister of the Parish of Concord , and earned a government stipend of \u00a3 150 . He was transferred to Sutton Forest in 1843 . Frederick Wilkinson , M.A. , was the rector during the period 1843 \u2013 1854 . He personally carved much of the woodwork in St Johns . During his rectorship , he also organized for St Mary 's church to be built in Balmain , and then St Thomas ' Enfield . Once St Mary 's was built , he presided alternately in Ashfield and Balmain . During his time at Ashfield , the Wilkinsons lived in a \" picturesque , many-gabled wooden house called The Meads in Enfield \" ( near Burwood road ) , where he had a large workshop for his wood-carving . He also established a private school at The Meads , which enjoyed a \" high reputation as the best collegiate school in the colony \" . Apart from a return trip to England ( serving as the ship 's chaplain during the journeys ) , he continued his leadership of St John 's until June 1854 when he accepted ' a special commission for the cure ' at Holy Trinity at Millers Point . Thomas Hatham / Hattam Wilkinson was the rector during the period 1854 \u2013 1860 . He had originally come to the colonies in the company of his father 's brother , Frederick . Since then he had been curate-in-charge at Balmain under his uncle , got married to Julia Sarah Underwood ( Elizabeth 's daughter ) at St John 's , served a short period as chaplain to Darlinghurst Gaol and three years as the assistant minister of St John the Baptist , Canberra . After his uncle left St John 's , he became the rector . After leaving St John 's , he moved to Enfield , and later Appin , finally returning for burial in the St John 's cemetery after his death in 1876 . William Lumsdaine was the newly ordained rector during the period 1860 \u2013 1865 . He had come to Australia with his two brothers and a sister in 1836 in the charge of Bishop Broughton . When he became rector , he rented Ashfield Park House , Elizabeth Underwood 's original house as his family residence . Along with Ashfield , he simultaneously held the incumbency for the parishes of Burwood , Enfield , and Five Dock . During his time at St John 's , two of his children died of diphtheria on the same day . After finishing at St John 's , he continued to serve at Five Dock and Burwood . He died in 1902 aged 78 and is buried in the St John 's cemetery . William Cecil Cave-Browne-Cave was the rector during the period 1865 \u2013 1867 . He was a grandson of the ninth Cave-Browne-Cave Baronet . He was recently married when he arrived at St John 's . Later in his career he held the rectorship at St Thomas ' North Sydney . Canon James Christian Corlette , D.D. , was the rector during the period 1867 \u2013 1900 . His previous appointment had been in Jamberoo . He was married to Frances Edith Manning , a daughter of the politician Sir William Montagu Manning . In 1877 she was elected to the committee of the newly formed Infant 's Home , as an indication of Anglican support . The home cared for abandoned babies , and was the subject of a storm of protest , with the Roman Catholic Cardinal Patrick Francis Moran accusing it of a \" vindication of promiscuous practices \" . The Corlettes ' eight children were all born during his time at St John 's . Perhaps not surprisingly , during this period St John 's first began to provide a residence for the rector . Corlette encouraged Ashfield 's Melanesian population to worship at St John 's , and many later returned to the islands as missionaries . He provided more frequent and regular services than his predecessor , and emphasized Saint 's Days , Communion and music . During the period 1868 \u2013 1884 he concurrently held the precentorship at St Andrew 's Cathedral , and in 1897 again served there as canon . In 1893 he was chaplain to the Bishop of Sydney , and became rural dean of Petersham in 1895 . Along with many of his family , he is buried in the St John 's cemetery . Alfred Yarnold was the rector during the period 1901 \u2013 1916 , which were the final fifteen years of his career . Immediately previously he had spent nineteen years as the rector of Christ Church , Lavender Bay . Overlapping with his time at St John 's , he was also the chaplain to the Archbishop of Sydney , and the rural dean of Petersham . One of Yarnold 's curates was the Rev. Charles Clark , who would later father the Australian historian Manning Clark . Clark 's mother was a teacher in the St John 's Sunday School William George Hilliard , M.A. , was the rector during the period 1916 \u2013 1926 . He was recently ordained when he joined St John 's , having completed only a four-year curacy at Dulwich Hill . His first wife died during his time at St John 's . When he completed his time at St John 's , he became the Headmaster of a local private school , Trinity Grammar School . In 1934 he became the Bishop of Nelson . He was described as \" one of the most popular evangelicals in the Church life of Australia , and a forceful preacher \" . Ainslie Arthur Yeates , M.A. , was the rector during the period 1927 \u2013 1928 . He came to Ashfield from St John 's Woolwich . Soon after he arrived he suffered a breakdown in his health , was very sick throughout his time at Ashfield , and died after a four-year incumbency . Herbert Stanley Cocks , B.A. Th.L. , was the rector during the period 1931 \u2013 1939 . He brought with him a wide experience of church work . Having been ordained just before World War I he had been a chaplain for the A.I.F. , and after demobilization a missionary , school principal , and chaplain in India . Most recently he had been rector of Holy Trinity , Erskineville . Leonard Neville Sutton , M.A. , was the rector during the period 1939 \u2013 1949 . He was a keen teacher , having previously been principal at St Andrew 's Cathedral School , chaplain at The King 's School , and vice-principal at Brighton Grammar School . He was very interested in the welfare of young people . This enthusiasm led him to start the St John 's Preschool . The Sunday School also had 350 pupils at the time . Frederick Allen Seymour Shaw , B.A. Th.L. , was the rector during the period 1949 \u2013 1966 . He had already served as an assistant clergyman at St John 's during 1930 \u2013 1931 . During that time , he was ordained . Eighteen years later he returned to St John 's as the rector . John R. Seddon , Th.L. Dip.R.E. , was the rector from 1966 until he transferred to St Luke 's Mosman in 1973 . Percy William \" Bill \" George Twine , Th.L. L.T.C.L. , was the rector during the period 1973 \u2013 1980 . He had long been an organ player , and inclined toward high church style . He died suddenly whilst still the rector . Stanford Ronald Colefax , R.F.D. Dip.Th. , was the rector during the period 1980 \u2013 1990 . Dennis P. Robinson , Th.L. was the rector during the period 1990 \u2013 2003 . Andrew Katay , B.D. M.Th. , became the rector in early 2005 . He was previously a Senior Associate Minister at St. Barnabas , Broadway , and Anglican chaplain at The University of Sydney , while leading the staff team of the Sydney University Evangelical Union . His arrival at the church marked a change from two traditional communion services to congregations with a variety of styles . = = = Acting rectors = = = From time to time , an acting rector or locum tenens has taken on temporary leadership , or filled a gap between rectors . Septimus Hungerford was acting rector in 1879 . He had previously been the rector of St Peter 's Cathedral , Armidale . Later he became the incumbent at St Thomas ' Enfield . William Hough took temporary leadership in 1889 whilst J. C. Corlette undertook the precentorship of Goulburn Cathedral . Arthur Christian Corlette stood in temporarily for his older brother J. C. Corlette in 1898 . Robert William Phayre Montgomery filled in at St John 's after the death of J. C. Corlette , during the period 1900 \u2013 1901 . He was an Irishman who came to Australia as a missionary chaplain in 1891 . After leaving St John 's he took up a position as vicar of Cressy Arthur Killworth M.A. LL.B. , acted as rector during the period 1928 \u2013 1931 . Archdeacon William Apedaile Charlton led St John 's for four months in 1939 after the departure of H. S. Cocks . He had already served in Sydney churches for 55 years . James R. Le Huray , Th.L. was the acting rector during the period 2004 \u2013 2005 . = = = Education = = = In the mid-1850s St John 's established a Church of England Denominational Day School in a small , plain white stone building near the corner of Charlotte and Bland St , which was reported as being in good repair with 28 pupils in 1867 . However , when the Ashfield public school expanded in 1875 , the church school proved unable to compete , and by 1880 it was closed . The building was sold to the newly begun Ashfield Boy 's College in 1882 , but was demolished in 1885 . Catholic education in the area flourished , and seeing this , J. C. Corlette wrote to England to Miss Ellen Clarke , suggesting that she start a school for young ladies in Ashfield . This went ahead , the school known as Normanhurst School began in a cottage in Bland Street . Although it was officially non-denominational , Normanhurst maintained strong links with St John 's . The school grew , and moved premises to Orpington Street , but eventually closed down in 1941 . = = Land and buildings = = = = = Church = = = Having evolved over a long period , the church building displays elements of a range of styles including Colonial Gothick Picturesque , Victorian and Federation Free Gothic . The transepts and chancel are constructed from Sydney sandstone , whereas the nave and tower are rendered brick . The roofs are all slate . The interior has been described as \" architecturally much more satisfying than its exterior \" . It has a hammerbeam ceiling with a curved rafter roof with colonettes , plaster walls , and stained glass in every window from a range of periods . The reredos and pulpit are distinctive cedar carvings by the early rector F. Wilkinson . = = = Cemetery = = = The cemetery is geographically aligned with the church , and takes up a large portion of the land area . The oldest graves are on the eastern side of the path , and typically face west . Newer graves on the western side of the path generally face east . A number of notable former Ashfield residents are buried at St John 's . First Fleet convict , John Limeburner / Linburner , had been transported for stealing clothing to the value of about one pound , eventually died in 1847 aged 104 . His headstone was defaced by vandals in 1965 . Several members of the Wilkinson and Underwood families were significant in the early European settlement of the Ashfield district . Louise Taplin ( 1855 \u2013 1901 ) was matron of The Infants Home in Ashfield for 15 years until her death , and led the home through the 1890s depression , despite a shortage of salaried staff . Henry Halloran ( 1811 \u2013 1893 ) was a poet and resident of Ashfield , and was married to Elizabeth Underwood 's daughter Elizabeth . Thomas Walker , a banker and philanthropist who owned and developed Yaralla Estate , is in a family grave with his wife Jane , and daughter Eadith 's ashes . Samuel Henry Terry , a wealthy landowner and politician is also buried at St Johns , having spent the last part of his life in an Ashfield residence named The Lilacs . Randolph John Want was a solicitor and member of the New South Wales Legislative Council . Edward Thomas Jones Wrench was one of the founding partners of real estate agents Richardson and Wrench . Amy Schauer was a cookery instructor and author . The graveyard also contains members of the Taverner , Uhr and Rodd families , after whom the localities Taverner 's Hill , Uhr 's Point , and Rodd Point are named . There are also graves of three former rectors : T. H. Wilkinson , W. Lumsdaine , and J. C. Corlette , and members of their families , together with a pioneer clergyman , E. Rogers . Beside these prominent figures , many of the St John 's graves contain children . Typhoid and whooping cough epidemics took heavy tolls in the Victorian period . Although Ashfield was known as a healthy area , many families lost two or even three children . Burial rates at St John 's declined rapidly around the turn of the 20th century . The rector 's notes from the time indicate that many funeral services conducted at the church now preceded burial at Rookwood Cemetery . Although the cemetery has never officially been closed , no burial plots have been sold for some years . A memorial garden for the interment of ashes was opened in the time of J. R. Seddon , providing a popular resting place for the Ashfield community . Since the late 1970s day-release prisoners have assisted with maintenance of the cemetery grounds . In Australia 's bicentennial year , 1988 , a $ 16,000 grant was awarded for restoration work in the cemetery , at which time some broken gravestones were cemented together , and some illegible ones were ' cut back ' and the letters repainted . = = Ministry = = Andrew Katay became the 18th rector in early 2005 . In 2008 the church was part of an amalgamation with the parish of Five Dock and Haberfield , forming Christ Church Inner West Anglican Community ( CCIW ) with Andrew Katay continuing as the rector of the new parish . There are currently three Sunday services at Ashfield , and two at Five Dock . Since July 2006 it has run a mothers and children group , which discusses Christian parenting issues , and teaches English to those for whom it is not their native language . In 2010 the church began an outdoor film festival showing ghost and horror movies in the historic cemetery .",

                    "text": "London Necropolis Railway = The London Necropolis Railway was a railway line opened in November 1854 by the London Necropolis Company ( LNC ) , to carry cadavers and mourners between London and the LNC 's newly opened Brookwood Cemetery 23 miles ( 37 km ) southwest of London in Brookwood , Surrey . At the time the largest cemetery in the world , Brookwood Cemetery was designed to be large enough to accommodate all the deaths in London for centuries to come , and the LNC hoped to gain a monopoly on London 's burial industry . The cemetery had intentionally been built far enough from London so as never to be affected by urban growth and was dependent on the recently invented railway to connect it to the city . The railway mostly ran along the existing tracks of the London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) but had its own branches from the main line at both London and Brookwood . Trains carried coffins and passengers from a dedicated station in Waterloo , London , onto the LSWR tracks . On reaching the cemetery , the trains reversed down a dedicated branch line to two stations in the cemetery , one for the burial of Anglicans and one for Nonconformists ( non-Anglicans ) and those who did not want a Church of England funeral . The station waiting rooms and the compartments of the train , both for living and for dead passengers , were partitioned by both religion and class to prevent both mourners and cadavers from different social backgrounds from mixing . As well as the regular funeral traffic , the London Necropolis Railway was used to transport large numbers of exhumed bodies during the mass removal of a number of London graveyards to Brookwood . The company failed to gain a monopoly of the burial industry , and the scheme was not as successful as its promoters had hoped . While they had planned to carry between 10,000 and 50,000 bodies per year , in 1941 after 87 years of operation , only slightly over 200,000 burials had been conducted in Brookwood Cemetery , equalling roughly 2,300 bodies per year . On the night of 16 \u2013 17 April 1941 , the London terminus was badly damaged in an air raid and rendered unusable . Although the LNC continued to operate occasional funeral services from Waterloo station to Brookwood railway station immediately north of the cemetery , the London Necropolis Railway was never used again . Soon after the end of the Second World War the surviving parts of the London station were sold as office space , and the rail tracks in the cemetery were removed . The part of the London building which housed the LNC 's offices survives today . The two stations in the cemetery remained open as refreshment kiosks for some years afterwards but were subsequently demolished . The site of the northern station , serving the Nonconformist cemetery , is now heavily overgrown . The site of the southern , Anglican , station is now the location of a Russian Orthodox monastery and a shrine to King Edward the Martyr , which incorporate the surviving station platform and the former station chapels . = = London burial crisis = = London 's dead had traditionally been buried in and around local churches , and with a limited amount of space for burials , the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials . In the first half of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled , from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851 . Despite this rapid growth in population , the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately 300 acres ( 0.5 sq mi ; 1.2 km2 ) , spread across around 200 small sites . Graveyards became very congested . Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera , smallpox , measles and typhoid . Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory ( the belief that airborne particles were the primary factor in the spread of contagious disease ) , and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern . A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London 's burial grounds had become so overcrowded that it was impossible to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one . In 1848 \u2013 49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely . Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial , and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials . = = = Proposed solutions = = = In the wake of public concerns following the cholera epidemics and the findings of the Royal Commission , the Act to Amend the Laws Concerning the Burial of the Dead in the Metropolis ( Burials Act ) was passed in 1851 . Under the Burials Act , new burials were prohibited in what were then the built-up areas of London . Seven large cemeteries had recently opened a short distance from London or were in the process of opening , and temporarily became London 's main burial grounds . The government sought a means to prevent the constantly increasing number of deaths in London from overwhelming the new cemeteries in the same manner in which it had overwhelmed the traditional burial grounds . Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery northwest of the city , which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London . A large tract of land on the Thames around 9 miles ( 14 km ) southeast of London in Abbey Wood was to become a single burial ground for east London . The Treasury was sceptical that Chadwick 's scheme would ever be financially viable , and it was widely unpopular . Although the Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 authorised the scheme , it was abandoned in 1852 . = = London Necropolis Company = = An alternative proposal was drawn up by Sir Richard Broun and Richard Sprye , who planned to use the emerging technology of mechanised transport to resolve the crisis . The scheme entailed buying a single very large tract of land around 23 miles ( 37 km ) from London in Brookwood near Woking , Surrey , to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis . At this distance , the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city 's growth . The London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) \u2014 which had connected London to Woking in 1838 \u2014 would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply . Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains , each carrying 50 \u2013 60 bodies , travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night , and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral . Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day . Broun calculated that a 1,500-acre ( 2.3 sq mi ; 6.1 km2 ) site would accommodate a total of 5,830,500 individual graves in a single layer . If the practice of only burying a single family in each grave were abandoned and the traditional practice for pauper burials of ten burials per grave were adopted , the site was capable of accommodating 28,500,000 bodies . Assuming 50,000 deaths per year and presuming that families would often choose to share a grave , Broun calculated that even with the prohibition of mass graves it would take over 350 years to fill a single layer of the cemetery . Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London , Broun and Sprye argued that the speed of the railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries , all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site . Shareholders in the LSWR were concerned at the impact the cemetery scheme would have on the normal operations of the railway . At a shareholders ' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted . The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators , other than promising them the use of one train each day . Charles Blomfield , Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes , arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service . Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train , and felt that it demeaned the dignity of the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives . On 30 June 1852 the promoters of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed , and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company ( LNC ) was formed . The former Woking Common near Brookwood , owned by the Earl of Onslow , was chosen as the site for the new cemetery . To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery , the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic , but did not specify detail of how the funeral trains were to operate . Broun 's scheme had envisaged the cemetery running along both sides of the LSWR main line and divided by religion , with separate private railway halts on the main line , each incorporating a chapel , to serve each religion 's section . The new consulting engineer to the company , William Cubitt , rejected this idea and recommended a single site to the south of the railway line , served by a private branch line through the cemetery . The company also considered Broun 's plan for dedicated coffin trains unrealistic , arguing that relatives would not want the coffins to be shipped separately from the deceased 's family . Internal disputes within the LNC led to Broun and Sprye losing control of the scheme , and later delays and allegations of mismanagement caused further changes to the scheme 's management . In September 1853 under a new board of trustees work began on the scheme . A site for the London rail terminus was identified and leased , and a 2,200-acre ( 3.4 sq mi ; 8.9 km2 ) tract of land stretching from Woking to Brookwood was purchased from Lord Onslow . The westernmost 400 acres ( 0.62 sq mi ; 1.6 km2 ) , at the Brookwood end , were designated the initial cemetery site , and a branch railway line was built from the main line into this section . On 7 November 1854 the new cemetery opened and the southern Anglican section was consecrated by Charles Sumner , Bishop of Winchester . At the time it was the largest cemetery in the world . On 13 November the first scheduled train left the new London Necropolis railway station for the cemetery , and the first burial ( that of the stillborn twins of a Mr and Mrs Hore of Ewer Street , Borough ) took place . = = Cemetery railway branch = = William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch at the west of the cemetery . Work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854 . The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later , at a total construction cost of \u00a3 1419 17s 6d ( about \u00a3 115,000 in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) . The junction with the LSWR , known as Necropolis Junction , was west-facing , meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch . No run-around loop was provided at Necropolis Junction , and a single crossover allowed trains from the Necropolis branch to reverse onto the northern ( London-bound ) track of the LSWR . The new branch ran east from Necropolis Junction on a downhill gradient . After passing through white gates marking the boundary of the cemetery , it curved south into the northern , Nonconformist section of the cemetery , the site of North station . The line straightened and ran southeast over a level crossing across Cemetery Pales , the road dividing the northern and southern halves of the initial cemetery site . After crossing Cemetery Pales the branch turned east and ran through the southern , Anglican , section of the cemetery , terminating at South station near the road from Bagshot to Guildford ( today the A322 ) which marked the eastern boundary of the site . Along with the major roads and paths in the cemetery , the entire branch was lined with giant sequoia trees , the first significant planting of these trees ( only introduced to Europe in 1853 ) in Britain . Aside from a short 100-yard ( 91 m ) siding just south of Cemetery Pales , built in 1904 \u2013 05 to serve the LNC 's new masonry workshop , the layout of the branch remained unchanged throughout its operation . In 1914 a brick water tower was added near the masonry works siding , to allow the LNC 's locomotives to refill their tanks before returning to London and thus avoid the need to interrupt their journey to refill at Woking . The poor quality gravel soil , which had been the initial reason for the site 's cheapness and its selection as the site for the cemetery , was poorly suited as a railway trackbed . The LNC 's rails , and in particular its sleepers , deteriorated rapidly and needed constantly to be replaced . In the early years of the cemetery 's operation , the locomotives hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down the branch into the cemetery , as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey . Instead , the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction , and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine . A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations . While the train was on the branch line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of the branch and onto the main line . In 1864 Brookwood ( Necropolis ) railway station on the LSWR opened , immediately east of Necropolis Junction . In conjunction with the building of the station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction , allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front to the rear of the train . From then on , on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned , but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear , under the close supervision of LNC staff . This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery , after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train and pull it back to London . Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks ; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line . Brookwood station was rebuilt , and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines . = = Operations = = The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of funerals , which also determined the type of railway ticket sold to mourners and the deceased . A first class funeral allowed the person buying the funeral to select the grave site of their choice anywhere in the cemetery ; at the time of opening prices began at \u00a3 2 10s ( about \u00a3 212 in 2016 terms ) for a basic 9-by-4-foot ( 2.7 m \u00d7 1.2 m ) plot with no special coffin specifications . It was expected by the LNC that those using first class graves would erect a permanent memorial of some kind in due course following the funeral . Second class funerals cost \u00a3 1 ( about \u00a3 85 in 2016 terms ) and allowed some control over the burial location . The right to erect a permanent memorial cost an additional 10 shillings ( about \u00a3 42 in 2016 terms ) ; if a permanent memorial was not erected the LNC reserved the right to re-use the grave in future . Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals ; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish . Although the LNC was forbidden from using mass graves ( other than the burial of next of kin in the same grave ) and thus even the lowest class of funeral provided a separate grave for the deceased , third class funerals were not granted the right to erect a permanent memorial on the site . ( The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third-class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial , but this practice was rare . ) At the time the service was inaugurated , the LNC 's trains were divided both by class and by religion , with separate Anglican and Nonconformist sections and separate first , second and third class compartments within each . This separation applied to both living and dead passengers . This was to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment , rather than to provide different levels of facilities for different types of mourner ; the compartments intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design , and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors . At 11.35 am ( 11.20 am on Sundays ) the train would leave London for Brookwood , arriving at Necropolis Junction at 12.25 pm ( 12.20 pm on Sundays ) . The LNC 's trains were capable of transporting large numbers of mourners when required ; the funeral of businessman Sir Nowroji Saklatwala on 25 July 1938 saw 155 mourners travelling first class on a dedicated LNC train . For extremely large funerals such as those of major public figures , the LSWR would provide additional trains from Waterloo to Brookwood station on the main line to meet the demand . Charles Bradlaugh , Member of Parliament for Northampton , was a vocal advocate of Indian self-government and a popular figure among the Indian community in London , many of whom attended his funeral on 3 February 1891 . Over 5,000 mourners were carried on three long special LSWR trains , one of which was 17 carriages long . The mourners included the 21-year-old Mohandas Gandhi , who recollected witnessing a loud argument between \" a champion atheist \" and a clergyman at North station while waiting for the return train . The return trains to London generally left South station at 2.15 pm and Necropolis Junction at 2.30 pm ; the return journey initially took around an hour owing to the need to stop to refill the engine with water , but following the construction of the water tower in the cemetery this fell to around 40 minutes . An 1854 agreement between the LNC and LSWR gave consent for the LNC to operate two or three funeral trains each day if demand warranted it , but traffic levels never rose to a sufficient level to activate this clause . The train only ran if there was a coffin or passengers at the London terminus waiting to use it , and both the journey from London to Brookwood and the later return would be cancelled if nobody was due to leave London that morning . It would not run if there was only a single third or second class coffin to be carried , and in these cases the coffin and funeral party would be held until the next service . Generally the trains ran direct from London to the cemetery , other than occasional stops to take on water . Between 1890 and 1910 the trains also sometimes stopped at Vauxhall and Clapham Junction for the benefit of mourners from south west London who did not want to travel via Waterloo , but these intermediate stops were discontinued and never reinstated . After 1 October 1900 the Sunday trains were discontinued , and from 1902 the daily train service was ended and trains ran only as required . = = = Fares = = = The Act of Parliament establishing the LNC had specified maximum ticket prices for the railway , and traffic never rose to the level at which it would have been justified for either the LNC or the LSWR to undertake costly and time consuming lobbying for a change in the legislation . As a consequence , despite the effects of inflation , competition and variable costs the fares of the London Necropolis Railway never changed throughout the first 85 of its 87 years of operation . Live passengers were charged 6s in first class , 3s 6d in second class and 2s in third class ( in 1854 worth about \u00a3 25 , \u00a3 15 and \u00a3 8 respectively in 2016 consumer terms ) for a return ticket , while dead passengers were charged \u00a3 1 in first class , 5s in second class and 2s 6d in third class ( in 1854 worth about \u00a3 85 , \u00a3 21 and \u00a3 11 respectively in 2016 consumer terms ) for a one-way ticket . As the railway was intended only to be used by Londoners visiting the cemetery or attending funerals , the only tickets ever issued to living passengers were returns from London . In 1918 the LSWR ( which provided the LNC 's passenger carriages ) abandoned second class services and the LNC as a consequence discontinued the sale of second class fares to living passengers , but continued to separate coffin tickets into first , second and third class dependent on the type of funeral booked . Intentionally set at a low level at the time the cemetery and railway opened , in later years the fixed fares offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood ( in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC 's equivalent ) . Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery . The fixed fares prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885 , as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC 's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR 's cargo rate ( 24 shillings in 1885 ) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium . In its last two years of operation , wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare structure untenable , and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares . The live passenger rates rose to 7s 5d in first class and 2s 6d in third class , with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins . These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway ( SR ) , which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain 's railways . The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services , for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR 's platforms at Waterloo station , but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery . = = = Relocation of London burial grounds = = = I did it wholesale and had 220 very large cases made each containing 26 human bodies besides children and these weighed 43 \u2044 4 cwt . There were 1,035 cwt of human remains sent in these cases alone . They were conveyed in the night and the Cemetery Company made arrangements for them . Each body has cost us less than three shillings . It was fortunate that such reasonable terms could be made at Woking Cemetery . A more horrible business you can scarcely imagine ; the men could only continue their work by the constant sprinkling of disinfectant powder . Mine was no easy task for the Bishop , the Warden , the parishioners and particularly the relatives have watched the steps taken , and the interviews with people and the correspondence has been great but all are more satisfied than could be expected . As well as taking over new burials from London 's now-closed burial grounds , the LNC also envisaged the physical relocation of the existing burial grounds to their Necropolis , to provide a final solution to the problems caused by burials in built-up areas . The massive London civil engineering projects of the mid-19th century \u2014 the railways , the sewer system and from the 1860s the precursors to the London Underground \u2014 often necessitated the demolition of existing churchyards . The first major relocation took place in 1862 , when the construction of Charing Cross railway station and the railway lines into it necessitated the demolition of the burial ground of Cure 's College in Southwark . Around 5,000 cubic yards ( 3,800 m3 ) of earth was displaced , uncovering at least 7,950 bodies . These were packed into 220 large containers , each containing 26 adults plus children , and shipped on the London Necropolis Railway to Brookwood for reburial , along with at least some of the existing headstones from the cemetery , at a cost of around 3 shillings per body . At least 21 London burial grounds were relocated to Brookwood via the railway , along with numerous others relocated by road following the railway 's closure . = = = Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial = = = In 1929 a section of the LNC 's land at Brookwood was set aside as Brookwood American Cemetery and Memorial , the sole burial ground in Britain for US military casualties of the First World War . As most US casualties had occurred in continental Europe and been buried there the number interred at Brookwood was small , with a total of 468 servicemen buried in the cemetery . After the entry of the United States into the Second World War the American cemetery was enlarged , with burials of US servicemen beginning in April 1942 . With large numbers of American personnel based in the west of England , a dedicated rail service for the transport of bodies operated from Devonport to Brookwood . By August 1944 over 3,600 bodies had been buried in the American Military Cemetery . At this time burials were discontinued , and US casualties were from then on buried at Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial . On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin , Quartermaster General of the United States Army , the US servicemen buried at Brookwood during the Second World War were exhumed in January \u2013 May 1948 . Those whose next of kin requested it were shipped to the United States for reburial , and the remaining bodies were transferred to the new cemetery outside Cambridge . ( Brookwood American Cemetery had also been the burial site for those US servicemen executed while serving in the United Kingdom , whose bodies had been carried to Brookwood by rail from the American execution facilities at Shepton Mallet . They were not transferred to Cambridge in 1948 , but instead reburied in unmarked graves at Oise-Aisne American Cemetery Plot E , a dedicated site for US servicemen executed during the Second World War . ) The railway service had been suspended in 1941 , and North station ( renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services ) was used as a temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA or Cambridge . As the branch line into the cemetery was no longer in use , temporary platforms were built on the branch line serving the National Rifle Association 's shooting range at Bisley , on the opposite side of the LSWR line from the cemetery . Following the removal of the US war graves the site in which they had been buried was divided into cemeteries for the Free French forces and Italian prisoners of war . = = Rolling stock = = = = = Locomotives = = = Under the terms of the 1852 agreement and Act of Parliament establishing the London Necropolis Company , the LSWR ( after 1923 the SR ) provided the locomotives and crew for London Necropolis Railway operations . There was no dedicated LNC locomotive , and the trains were worked by whichever suitable engine happened to be available . ( Before the 1864 improvements to Necropolis Junction , locomotives rarely entered the cemetery branch line itself and the trains were generally hauled along the branch line by horses . ) Towards the end of the railway 's operations in the 1930s the route was almost always worked by LSWR M7 class locomotives , usually No. 255 . = = = Passenger carriages = = = The passenger carriages used on the London Necropolis Railway were not owned by the LNC , but loaned from the LSWR . A set of carriages was permanently loaned , rather than carriages being lent as needed , as the LSWR was concerned that passengers might be discouraged from using regular LSWR services if they knew that their carriages had potentially carried dead bodies recently . The original set of carriages , used between 1854 and 1899 , were four-wheeled carriages to a design by Joseph Hamilton Beattie . Little is recorded about the number and specifications of the carriages . The same set of carriages remained in use for over 40 years , prompting increasingly strong complaints from the LNC about their deteriorating quality . As part of an 1896 agreement by which the LSWR re-equipped the LNC in conjunction with the repositioning of the LNC 's London terminus , the LNC demanded that the new passenger carriages to be supplied by the LSWR be \" of a quality and a character not inferior to [ the LSWR 's ] ordinary main line traffic \" . These new carriages were supplied late in the 19th century , probably in December 1899 . They were all six-wheeled , and comprised two 30-foot ( 9.1 m ) passenger brake vans each containing three third class compartments , a baggage compartment and the guard 's compartment ; a 34-foot ( 10 m ) passenger carriage divided into three first class and two second class compartments ; and a 30-foot ( 9.1 m ) passenger carriage divided into five third class compartments ( also used as all second class ) . Although not recorded , it is likely that other carriages were also permanently loaned to the LNC for use as needed . This set of carriages only remained in use for a short period , and in 1907 was replaced by a new set of carriages of which little is known . In 1917 this set was itself replaced by two 51-foot ( 16 m ) passenger brake vans each containing two first and four third class compartments , a 50-foot ( 15 m ) carriage with three first and three third class compartments , and a 46-foot ( 14 m ) carriage with six third class compartments . This set operated for most of the inter-war period , being withdrawn in April 1938 . It was replaced by a very similar set of coaches at this time , which was withdrawn in September 1939 after the outbreak of hostilities for use in troop trains . The carriages were replaced by the former Royal Train , built 1900 \u2013 04 , of the now-defunct South Eastern and Chatham Railway . These ornately decorated carriages were those destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus . = = = Hearse vans = = = Unlike the loaned locomotives and passenger carriages , the LNC owned its dedicated hearse vans outright . Despite this , they were always painted in whichever colour scheme was currently in use by the LSWR ( SR after 1923 ) , to match the livery of the passenger cars and locomotives loaned to the LNC . As with the carriages for living passengers , the hearse vans were designed to prevent bodies mixing with those from different backgrounds . Each of the original vans was partitioned into twelve sections in two rows of six , each capable of holding one coffin ; later vans were of a slightly different design and probably carried 14 coffins . The vans were fitted with internal partitions to divide first , second and third class coffins . The LNC intended to use half the hearse vans for Anglican and half for Nonconformist coffins , to prevent Anglicans from sharing a carriage with Nonconformists , but in practice this arrangement was little used . Unlike traditional Victorian funerals , in which the hearse invariably led the funeral procession , photographic evidence shows that the LNC sometimes placed the hearse van at the rear of the train . ( Because trains reversed from Necropolis Junction into the cemetery , no matter which arrangement was used the hearse van would inevitably be at the rear of the train for part of the journey . ) The LNC ordered six hearse vans in 1854 , two of which were operational at the time the cemetery and Necropolis Railway opened . Their origins are not recorded , although they were bought very cheaply suggesting that they were conversions of existing carriages rather than built to order . Many LNC records from this period have been lost and it is not certain how many hearse vans were delivered , and how they were used ; records suggest that anything between three and ten hearse vans were bought or leased by the LNC in the early years of operations . ( As each van carried 12 \u2013 14 coffins and it is known that some funeral trains in the late 19th century carried over 60 coffins , at least six hearse vans must have been in use . ) As part of the settlement during the relocation of the London terminus , two new hearse vans were given to the LNC by the LSWR in 1899 . These new hearse vans were longer , and divided into three levels with compartments for eight coffins on each , for a total of 24 coffins per van . These replaced the existing hearse vans and remained in use until the closure of the Necropolis Railway . One of the vans was destroyed in the 1941 bombing of the London terminus ; the other was transferred to the SR and remained in use until at least 1950 . The former Royal Train brought into passenger service on the London Necropolis Railway in 1939 had a large amount of luggage space , and it is probable that when funeral traffic was light the hearse vans were not used and the coffins carried in the luggage space . = = Cemetery stations = = On William Cubitt 's advice the two stations in the cemetery were built as temporary structures , in the expectation that they would need to be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of this unique nature became clearer . Both were designed by Sydney Smirke , who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854 . Each station was built as a one-storey building around a square courtyard . The side adjacent to the railway line was left open , and wings extended from the building along the platform on each side . Other than the brick platform faces , chimneys and foundations , the stations were built entirely of wood . Each station held first class and ordinary reception rooms for mourners , a first class and an ordinary refreshment room , and a set of apartments for LNC staff . The refreshment rooms at both stations were licensed ( permitted to sell alcohol ) . The train crews would generally wait in these refreshment rooms until the trains were ready to return to London , and on at least one occasion ( on 12 January 1867 ) the driver became so drunk that the fireman had to drive the train back to London . This incident prompted a complaint from the LSWR and from that time the LNC provided the train crew with a free lunch , provided they drank no more than one pint of beer . In mid-1855 cellars were dug beneath the stations , and the coffin reception rooms at each station were converted into \" pauper waiting rooms \" . Neither station was equipped with gas or electricity ; throughout their existence the buildings were lit by oil lamps and coal ranges were used for heating and cooking . The platform faces themselves incorporated an indentation , one brick-width deep and the width of the courtyard . This indentation facilitated the unloading of coffins from the lower levels of the hearse carriages . On arrival at the stations coffins would usually be unloaded onto a hand-drawn bier and pulled by LNC staff to the appropriate chapel . While this was taking place the mourners were escorted to the waiting rooms at the station . On arrival at the chapels first and second class funerals would generally have a brief service ( third class funerals had a single service in the appropriate chapel for all those being buried ) . For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC 's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave . = = = North station = = = North station , serving Roman Catholics , Parsees , Jews and Nonconformist Christians as well as some groups with dedicated plots in the northern cemetery such as actors and Oddfellows , was the first station on the branch . At the time the cemetery opened North station incorporated the lodgings of James Bailey , superintendent of the Nonconformist cemetery . In 1861 Bailey became the sole cemetery superintendent and moved into a cottage elsewhere on the grounds , and his apartment was given to Richard Lee , a cemetery porter . Census records show Lee living at North station , until 1865 with his mother Ann and later with his wife Charlotte , until at least 1871 . A number of cemetery staff lived in the station apartment until the 1950s . By this time the railway itself had closed but the station 's refreshment kiosk remained open . Steps led from the 210-foot ( 64 m ) long platform to a path leading to a chapel , on a hilltop behind the station . Between 1942 and 1944 large numbers of Allied service personnel were buried in the military section of Brookwood cemetery . On the authority of Thomas B. Larkin , Quartermaster General of the United States Army , 3,600 bodies of US servicemen were exhumed in January \u2013 May 1948 and shipped to the United States for reburial . The railway service had been suspended in 1941 , and North station ( renamed North Bar after the ending of rail services ) was used as a temporary mortuary to hold these bodies while awaiting shipment to the USA . On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy , who operated the refreshment kiosk in the station building from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment , the building was abandoned . It was demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot . = = = South station = = = The design of South station was broadly similar to that of North station . Unlike the platform steps of North station , the platform of South station had a ramp leading to an Anglican chapel at the northern end of the platform . A shed adjacent to the station held hand-drawn biers , used to transport coffins around the large southern cemetery . At the time the branch line opened the platform of South station was only 128 feet ( 39 m ) long , far shorter than the 210-foot ( 64 m ) platform of North station . At some point the platform was greatly extended south from the station building to a total length of 256 feet ( 78 m ) , allowing equipment to be unloaded discreetly without disturbing users of the station . At the time of opening the apartment in the station housed George Bupell , superintendent of the Anglican cemetery . As with the North station , once James Bailey became sole cemetery superintendent in 1861 the use of the apartment was granted to a cemetery porter , and housed a succession of cemetery staff over the years . Following the suspension of railway services in 1941 the building was renamed South Bar , and remained in use as a refreshment kiosk . The last operators of the kiosk , Mr and Mrs Ladd , retired in the late 1960s and from then on the station building was used as a cemetery storeroom . Around half the building was destroyed by fire in September 1972 . The building was popular with railway and architectural enthusiasts as a distinctive piece of Victorian railway architecture , but despite a lobbying campaign to preserve the surviving sections of the station the remaining buildings ( other than the platform itself ) were demolished shortly afterwards . By the time of its demolition the \" temporary \" structure was 118 years old . = = = Brookwood station = = = At the time the cemetery opened , the nearest railway station other than those on the cemetery branch was Woking railway station , 4 miles ( 6.4 km ) away . As only one train per day ran from London to the cemetery stations and even that ran only when funerals were due to take place , access to the cemetery was difficult for mourners and LNC staff . Although in the negotiations leading to the creation of the cemetery the LSWR had told the LNC that they planned to build a main line station near the cemetery , they had not done so . In 1863 , with the cemetery fully operational and a planned new lunatic asylum near Brookwood likely to boost traffic , the LSWR agreed to build a mainline station at Brookwood , along with an improved Necropolis Junction and a goods yard , provided the LNC supplied the necessary land and built the approach road and stationmaster 's house for the new station . The new station , called Brookwood ( Necropolis ) railway station ( the suffix was gradually dropped ) , opened on 1 June 1864 . A substantial commuter village grew around the northern ( i.e. non-cemetery ) side of the new station , and the station building ( on the northern side of the tracks ) was enlarged in 1890 . In conjunction with these works , a branch line was added in 1890 from a bay platform to the National Rifle Association 's shooting range at Bisley , running west to the north of the LSWR main line before curving north to Bisley . In 1903 the quadrupling of the LSWR tracks necessitated a major rebuilding of the station . The down ( westbound ) platform was demolished , and a new 576-foot ( 176 m ) long down platform was built , along with a second station building facing the cemetery , from which a footpath led across the cemetery branch 's tracks and into the cemetery . = = London stations = = A site for the London terminus near Waterloo was suggested by Sir Richard Broun . Its proximity to the Thames meant that bodies could be cheaply transported to the terminus by water from much of London , and the area was easily accessed from both north and south of the river by road . The arches of the huge brick viaduct carrying the LSWR into Waterloo Bridge station ( now London Waterloo station ) were easily converted into mortuaries . Broun also felt that the journey out of London from Waterloo Bridge would be less distressing for mourners ; while most of the rail routes out of London ran through tunnels and deep cuttings or through densely populated areas , at this time the urban development of what is now south London had not taken place and the LSWR route ran almost entirely through parkland and countryside . The LNC also contemplated taking over the LSWR 's former terminus at Nine Elms railway station ( which following the 1848 opening of the much more convenient Waterloo Bridge station was used only for goods traffic , chartered trains taking migrants to North America , and the private trains of the royal family ) as either the main or a secondary terminus . Despite objections from local residents concerned about the effects of potentially large numbers of dead bodies being stored in a largely residential area , in March 1854 the LNC settled on a single terminus in Waterloo and purchased a plot of land between Westminster Bridge Road and York Street ( now Leake Street ) for the site . Architect William Tite and engineer William Cubitt drew up a design for a station , which was approved in June 1854 . = = = First London terminus ( 1854 \u2013 1902 ) = = = Tite and Cubitt 's design was based around a three storey main building , separated from the LSWR 's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC 's twin rail lines , intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly , and avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road . The building housed two mortuaries , the LNC 's boardroom and funerary workshops , and a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending first , second and third class funerals . A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level above . Although the original London terminus did not have its own chapel , on some occasions mourners would not be able or willing to make the journey to a ceremony at Brookwood but for personal or religious reasons were unable to hold the funeral service in a London church . On these occasions one of the waiting rooms would be used as a makeshift funeral chapel . As the site of the station was adjacent to the arches of the LSWR 's viaduct , it blocked any increase in the number of lines serving Waterloo station ( renamed from Waterloo Bridge station in 1886 ) . Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London , through which trains from Waterloo ran , led to congestion at the station and in 1896 the LSWR formally presented the LNC with a proposal to provide the LNC with a new station in return for the site of the existing terminus . The LNC agreed to the proposals , in return for the LSWR granting the LNC control of the design of the new station and leasing the new station to the LNC for a token rent in perpetuity , providing new rolling stock , removing any limit on the number of passengers using the Necropolis service , and providing the free carriage of machinery and equipment to be used in the cemetery . Although the LSWR was extremely unhappy at what they considered excessive demands , in May 1899 the companies signed an agreement , in which the LSWR gave in to every LNC demand . In addition the LSWR paid \u00a3 12,000 compensation ( about \u00a3 1.22 million in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) for the inconvenience of relocating the LNC station and offices , and agreed that mourners returning from the cemetery could travel on any LSWR train to Waterloo , Vauxhall or Clapham Junction . = = = Second London terminus ( 1902 \u2013 1941 ) = = = A site for the replacement terminus was bought by the LSWR in 1899 , south of the existing site and on the opposite side of Westminster Bridge Road . It was completed on 8 February 1902 , and the LSWR viaduct was widened to serve a greatly enlarged Waterloo station , destroying all traces of the original LNC terminus . The new building was designed for attractiveness and modernity to contrast with the traditional gloomy decor associated with the funeral industry . A narrow four-storey building on Westminster Bridge Road held the LNC 's offices . Behind it was the main terminal ; this held a communal third-class waiting room , mortuaries and storerooms , the LNC 's workshops , and a sumptuous oak-panelled Chapelle Ardente , intended for mourners unable to make the journey to Brookwood to pay their respects to the deceased . This building led onto the two platforms , lined with waiting rooms and a ticket office . = = = Destruction = = = During the Second World War Waterloo station and the nearby Thames bridges were a significant target for Axis bombing , and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940 \u2013 41 . Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line , the Necropolis station was undamaged during the early stages of the bombing campaign . During the night of 16 \u2013 17 April 1941 , in one of the last major air raids on London , bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area . The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned , and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged , but the terminal building itself remained unscathed . At 10.30 pm multiple incendiary devices and high explosive bombs struck the central section of the terminus building . While the office building and platforms survived , the workshops , driveway and Chapelle Ardente were destroyed , along with the third class waiting room . The Southern Railway 's Divisional Engineer inspected the damage at 2.00 pm on 17 April , and his report read simply \" Necropolis and buildings demolished \" . On 11 May 1941 the station was officially declared closed . The last recorded funeral party carried on the London Necropolis Railway was that of Chelsea Pensioner Edward Irish ( 1868 \u2013 1941 ) , buried on 11 April 1941 . The Southern Railway offered the LNC the temporary use of platform 11 or 12 of Waterloo station to allow the service to be continued , but refused to allow the LNC to continue to sell cheap tickets to visitors travelling to and from the cemetery stations other than those involved in a funeral that day , meaning those visiting the cemetery other than members of funeral parties had little reason to choose the LNC 's irregular and infrequent trains over the SR 's fast and frequent services to Brookwood . The LNC attempted to negotiate a deal by which genuine mourners could still travel cheaply to the cemetery on the 11.57 am service to Brookwood ( the SR service closest to the LNC 's traditional departure time ) , but the SR management , themselves under severe financial pressure owing to wartime constraints and damage , refused to entertain any compromise . = = Closure = = In September 1945 , following the end of hostilities , the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway . Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition , the branch line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus . With the soil of the cemetery causing the branch to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained , the branch line was in extremely poor condition . Although the original promoters of the scheme had envisaged Brookwood Cemetery becoming London 's main or only cemetery , the scheme had never been as popular as they had hoped . In the original proposal , Richard Broun had calculated that over its first century of operations the cemetery would have seen around five million burials at a rate of 50,000 per year , the great majority of which would have utilised the railway . In reality at the time the last train ran on 11 April 1941 , almost 87 years after opening , only 203,041 people had been buried in the cemetery . Before the outbreak of hostilities , increased use of motorised road transport had damaged the profitability of the railway for both the LNC and the Southern Railway . Faced with the costs of rebuilding the cemetery branch line , building a new London terminus and replacing the rolling stock damaged or destroyed in the air raid , the directors concluded that \" past experience and present changed conditions made the running of the Necropolis private train obsolete \" . In mid-1946 the LNC formally informed the SR that the Westminster Bridge Road terminus would not be reopened . The decision prompted complicated negotiations with the SR over the future of the LNC facilities in London . In December 1946 the directors of the two companies finally reached agreement . The railway-related portions of the terminus site ( the waiting rooms , the caretaker 's flat and the platforms themselves ) would pass into the direct ownership of the SR , while the remaining surviving portions of the site ( the office block on Westminster Bridge Road , the driveway and the ruined central portion of the site ) would pass to the LNC to use or dispose of as they saw fit . The LNC sold the site to the British Humane Association in May 1947 for \u00a3 21,000 ( about \u00a3 741,000 in terms of 2016 consumer spending power ) , and the offices of the LNC were transferred to the Superintendent 's Office at Brookwood . The SR continued to use the surviving sections of the track as occasional sidings into the 1950s , before clearing what remained of their section of the site . While most of the LNC 's business was now operated by road , an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC to make use of SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals , subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR ( British Railways after 1948 ) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train . Although one of the LNC 's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used , and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR 's coaches . Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the funeral party and transported by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations , or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road . Although the LNC proposed to convert the cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery , this never took place . The rails and sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947 , and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath . The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings , before being dismantled on 30 November 1964 . After the closure of the branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks , and were renamed North Bar and South Bar . = = After closure = = Following the 1947 nationalisation of Britain 's railways , the use of the railway to transport coffins to Brookwood went into steep decline . New operating procedures required that coffins be carried in a separate carriage from other cargo ; as regular services to Brookwood station used electric multiple unit trains which did not have goods vans , coffins for Brookwood had to be shipped to Woking and then carried by road for the last part of the journey , or a special train had to be chartered . The last railway funeral to be carried by British Rail anywhere was that of Lord Mountbatten in September 1979 , and from 28 March 1988 British Rail formally ceased to carry coffins altogether . Since Mountbatten , the only railway funeral to be held in the United Kingdom has been that of former National Union of Rail , Maritime and Transport Workers General Secretary Jimmy Knapp , carried from London to Kilmarnock for burial in August 2001 . = = = Stations = = = Most of the site of the 1902 London terminus was built over with new office developments in the years following the end of the Second World War , but the office building on Westminster Bridge Road , over the former entrance to the station driveway , remains relatively unaltered externally although the words \" London Necropolis \" carved into the stone above the driveway have been covered . Refurbishments and cleaning in the 1980s restored the facade of the building to an appearance similar to that of the time of its building . Other than iron columns in Newnham Terrace which once supported the Necropolis Railway tracks , and a surviving section of the internal driveway used as a car park , the Westminster Bridge Road building is the only surviving part of the London Necropolis Railway in London . Brookwood station on the former LSWR line ( now the South Western Main Line and the Alton Line ) is little changed since the 1903 expansion and rebuilding . It remains in use both by commuters from the village which has grown to the north of the railway line , and by visitors to the cemetery to the south of the line . A small monument to the London Necropolis Railway , consisting of a short length of railway track on the former trackbed , was erected in 2007 outside the southern ( cemetery-side ) entrance to the station . The site of North station has significantly changed . The ornate mausoleum of Sharif Al-Hussein Ben Ali ( d . 1998 ) stands directly opposite the remains of the platform . The operators of the Shia Islamic section of the cemetery have planted Leylandii along the boundary of their section of the cemetery , which includes the platform of North station . Unless the trees are removed , the remains of the station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth . The land surrounding the site of South station and the station 's two Anglican chapels were redundant following the closure of the railway . As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused original Anglican chapel into a crematorium , using the newer chapel for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations . Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by a succession of hostile takeover bids , the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme and the buildings fell into disuse . The station building was demolished after being damaged by a fire in 1972 , although the platform remained intact . Since 1982 the site of South station has been owned by the St. Edward Brotherhood , and forms part of a Russian Orthodox monastery . The original Anglican chapel is used as a visitor 's centre and living quarters for the monastery , while the larger Anglican chapel built in 1908 \u2013 09 immediately north of the station is now the Russian Orthodox Church of St. Edward the Martyr , and houses the relics and shrine of Edward the Martyr , king of England from 975 \u2013 978 AD . The site of the former station buildings is now the main monastery building , while the platform itself remains intact and now marks the boundary of the monastic enclosure . = = = Brookwood Cemetery and the LNC = = = The LNC continued to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s on the matter of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery , but were unable to come to any agreement . In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s 6d ( compared to the standard rate of 9s 4d ) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood . By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road . The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not be sufficient to attract visitors back to the railway , and the proposal was abandoned . With the area around Woking by this time heavily populated , the LNC 's land holdings had become an extremely valuable asset , and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated hostile takeover bids from property speculators . In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company , bringing over a century of independence to an end . Alliance Property was a property company with little interest in the funeral business , and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds . Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began to revert to wilderness . This trend continued under a succession of further owners . The Brookwood Cemetery Act 1975 authorised the cemetery 's owners ( at that time Maximilian Investments ) to sell surplus land within the cemetery 's boundaries , leading to the construction of a major office development on the site of the former Superintendent 's office , near the former level crossing between the northern and southern cemeteries . The masonry works remained operational until the early 1980s , and were then converted into office buildings and named Stonemason 's Court . In March 1985 the cemetery was bought by Ramadan G\u00fcney , whose family still owns the cemetery as of 2011 . The Guney family embarked on a programme of encouraging new burials in the cemetery , and of slowly clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery . While it was never as successful as planned , Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom and one of the largest in the world . Although not the world 's only dedicated funeral railway line , the London Necropolis Railway was the first , the longest lasting and by far the best known . = = In popular culture = = As well as forming a key element of Basil Copper 's novel Necropolis ( 1980 ) , the railway and cemetery received widespread attention following the 2002 publication of Andrew Martin 's novel The Necropolis Railway ( 2002 ) . Both books were critically acclaimed and led to increased public interest in the London Necropolis Company and its railway operations . On 31 July 2015 , the opening episode of the third series of the BBC television drama Ripper Street featured a collision between a mainline locomotive and a LNC train which had been diverted by criminals onto the wrong line .",

It starts at Aldersgate in the City of London , passing through the capital to Borehamwood on the northern fringe of Greater London , before continuing to Edinburgh . The road travels through the City and three London boroughs : Islington , Haringey and Barnet , which include the districts of Islington , Holloway , Highgate , Hendon and Mill Hill , and travels along Upper Street and Holloway Road , crossing the North Circular Road in Hendon , a district in the London Borough of Barnet . The A1 is the most recent in a series of routes north out of London to York and beyond . It was designated in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme , comprising existing roads and streets , mostly historic , and later using stretches of purpose-built new roads in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet . The Archway Road section was built by Thomas Telford using Roman cement and gravel , an innovative technique that was used there for the first time , and is the basis for modern road building . The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road , though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s . The A1 is one of London 's main roads , providing a link to the M1 and the A1 ( M ) motorways , and on to the Midlands , Northern England and Scotland . Despite this , its main use is to connect a number of neighbourhoods within north London ; less than 5 % of its vehicles are through traffic \u2013 the bulk is local . The roads along which the A1 route travels are the shared responsibility of the local boroughs , the Greater London Authority , and the British Government via the Department for Transport . = = History = = The A1 is the latest in a series of routes north from London to York and beyond , and was formed in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport as part of the Great Britain road numbering scheme . The earliest documented northern routes out of London are the roads created by the Romans during the period 43 to 410 AD , which consisted of a variety of \" Iters \" on the Antonine Itinerary , a combination of which were used by the Anglo-Saxons as the route from London to York , and which became known as Ermine Street . Ermine Street later became known as the Old North Road , and is used within London by the current A10 . By the 12th century , because of flooding and damage by traffic on Ermine Street , an alternative route out of London was found through Islington and Muswell Hill , and this was the origin of the Great North Road that would become the A1 . Until the 14th century the route went up what is now Hornsey Road \u2013 the A103 road , but when that became impassable a new route along Holloway Road via Highgate was created in the 14th century . The section through Highgate was bypassed in the early 19th century by the creation of a new road , Archway Road , and around the same time a turnpike road , New North Road and Canonbury Road ( the A1200 road ) , was constructed linking the start of the Old North Road around Shoreditch with the Great North Road at Highbury Corner . The route of the A1 in London originally started at Aldersgate Bars , which marked the boundary of the City of London , and followed the Great North Road mail coach route through Barnet ; the route was re-designated in 1954 to follow the East Finchley and Barnet by-passes built in the 1920s and 1930s , so within London the coaching route is now mainly only followed when passing through the borough of Islington . During the early 1970s plans to widen the A1 along the Archway Road section were abandoned after considerable opposition and four public inquiries during which road protesters disrupted proceedings . The scheme was finally dropped in 1990 . = = Governance = = The roads along which the A1 route travels are the shared responsibility of the local boroughs , the Greater London Authority ( GLA ) , and the British Government . The first organised London-wide authority dealing with roads in London was the Metropolitan Board of Works ( MBW ) , set up in 1856 . The MBW replaced the disparate turnpike trusts which had already been amalgamated in 1826 into the single control of Government Commissioners , and was itself replaced by the London County Council ( LCC ) in 1889 . The LCC became the Greater London Council ( GLC ) in 1965 , and during the 1960s when traffic management in London was being modernised , and the London Ringways was proposed , the GLC , which was not in favour of increasing traffic into central London , had control of the inner London roads , while the government , through the Ministry of Transport , which was in favour of widening roads , had control of outer London . These different approaches resulted in the Ministry of Transport widening a stretch of the A1 until it reached the control of the GLC , when the widening abruptly stopped . Due to the problems associated with two different and opposing bodies having responsibility for London 's roads , the government were keen to take control of the major routes , and made plans in 1983 for the Department of Transport to take over 70 miles of road , including significant parts of the A1 ; when the GLC was abolished in 1986 , the Department of Transport took over direct control of the 70 miles of major routes , plus had a significant influence on another 300 . In 2000 control of roads in London passed to Transport for London , a department of GLA created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 , and the major roads , including the A1 , were declassified as trunk roads . = = Route = = The route of the A1 in London runs from the northern end of St. Martin 's Le Grand in the City to Borehamwood in Hertfordshire , then travels on the northern fringe of Greater London to Bignell 's Corner , where it crosses the M25 and becomes a motorway , designated A1 ( M ) , which alternates with the dual carriageway A1 as it continues to Edinburgh . The London section of the road passes through part of the City of London and three London boroughs : Islington , Haringey and Barnet . The A1 is one of London 's main northern routes , providing a link to the M1 motorway and the A1 ( M ) motorway , and on to the Midlands , Northern England and Scotland . It connects a number of major areas within London , and sections of it serve as the High Street for many of the now-joined villages that make up north London . Even though it is one of London 's major roads , less than 5 % of its approximate 60,000 vehicles a day are through traffic \u2013 the bulk is local . The current start of the A1 is the modern roundabout at the northern end of St. Martin 's Le Grand where it meets Aldersgate Street , near the site of the now demolished General Post Office , London , the headquarters of the Post Office from 1829 to 1910 . When originally designated in 1921 the A1 started a little further north along Aldersgate Street at Aldersgate Bars , which marked the boundary of the City , though some later maps indicate it starting at the southern end of St. Martin 's Le Grand , near St Paul 's Cathedral . The route runs north from Aldersgate along Aldersgate Street which is a modern dual carriageway , and from the 13th century was known as a wide street with fine buildings and travellers ' inns ; these were destroyed or badly damaged during the Blitz , and from 1965 to 1976 the 40 acre ( 162,000m \u00b2 ) Barbican Estate , an arts complex and residential estate , was constructed along the entire eastern side of the street . At the end of Aldersgate Street stood Aldersgate Bars , which marked the limits of the City of London . = = = Islington = = = The route enters the London Borough of Islington at Goswell Road becoming a single carriageway running north from the border of the City to Angel through a mix of offices and urban housing . Goswell Road and St John Street were the ancient routes from the City to Islington , with St John Street being the start of the Great North Road until the General Post Office headquarters was built at St Martin 's-le-Grand in 1829 , whereafter stagecoaches used Aldersgate Street and Goswell Road . The New River originally flowed down the centre of Goswell Road , but is now underground and no trace of it can be seen at the surface . The street was reported in 1720 to be \" meanly built and inhabited \" , containing numerous inns and brothels , and it largely remained a slum area until the rebuilding that took place after the Second World War , and in particular the residential development that spread out from the Barbican since 1980 . At the northern end of Goswell Road , the route northwards follows a one-way section to the Angel , turning right into Islington High Street . The southwards route from Islington High Street follows City Road for a short distance before joining Goswell Road via Wakley Street . The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area . At this time , nine inns ( including the Angel , which subsequently gave its name to the area ) , as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street . The Peacock Inn , one of the nine inns , and which operated on Islington High Street from 1564 to 1962 , was where Tom of Tom Brown 's Schooldays stayed prior to travelling to Rugby School . In 1716 Islington High Street came under the control of the newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust . The Trust grew rapidly and soon had control of most major roads in the area , building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas , including Caledonian Road , Euston Road , City Road and New North Road . Upper Street , running roughly north from Islington High Street to Highbury Corner , is the main shopping street of Islington , and dates back to at least the 12th century . Livestock herded along the Great North Road for Smithfield Market , would \u2013 when passing through what was mainly fields and farmland \u2013 pause at lairs built between Upper Street and Liverpool Road by an enterprising farmer , Richard Laycock ; Laycock 's lairs would be used in 1861 for the site of the Royal Agricultural Hall , and a number of pubs and shops existed along the street to serve farmers and travellers headed for Smithfield . In the 18th century , Upper Street began to develop from an agricultural to a residential area . Ten houses were built in 1768 ( later named Hornsey Row ) , and a further group built immediately south of Hornsey Row in 1792 . Liverpool Road , originally called Back Road , was used as an alternative to Upper Street for the Smithfield herders , and both streets have a \" high pavement \" constructed to protect pedestrians from being splashed by the passing animals ; in places , the pavement is approximately 1 m above the road surface . After reaching the eight-way interchange at Highbury Corner , the A1 turns north-west as Holloway Road . Until the 14th century the route turned off along what is now Hornsey Road \u2013 the A103 road \u2013 to go through Muswell Hill , but when that became impassable a new route along Holloway Road via Highgate was created in the 14th century . The earliest record giving the name of the road as the Holloway dates from 1307 . The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the villages of Tollington and Stroud . The exact time of their founding is not known , but the earliest record of them dates from 1000 . The names ceased to be used by the late 17th century but are still preserved in the local place names \" Tollington Park \" and \" Stroud Green \" ; since that time , the area has been known as Holloway . The northern point of Holloway Road is the complex interchange at Archway . The construction of the interchange left a few buildings isolated in the centre of the roundabout , including the Archway Tavern , which appears on the cover of The Kinks ' 1971 album Muswell Hillbillies . = = = Haringey = = = After the Archway roundabout , the A1 enters a cutting , and becomes Archway Road . The original road north went up the very steep Highgate Hill ( now the B519 ) to the village of Highgate . By the early 19th century , this was proving unsuitable for increasingly heavy traffic , and a road , crossing the hill through a tunnel at a shallower gradient , was proposed by a mining engineer , Robert Vazie , in 1808 ; a turnpike trust \u2013 the Highgate Archway Company \u2013 was set up and work started in 1810 . The brick built tunnel collapsed during construction on 13 April 1812 , and John Nash constructed a brick bridge , using a series of arches like a canal viaduct , to carry Hornsey Lane over what was now a cutting . Nash 's Archway Bridge , a little way south of the current bridge , and the new Archway Road were opened in 1813 , though the road surface , being constructed of sand and gravel , proved difficult for heavy traffic . Parliamentary Commissioners took over the road , and John Benjamin Macneill , chief engineer to Thomas Telford , proposed using Roman cement and gravel , an innovative technique that was used for the first time on Archway Road , and is the basis for modern road building . The construction was financed by tolls which were abolished in 1876 \u2013 traffic increased substantially thereafter , particularly after the introduction of trams on the road . Between 1897 and 1900 , Nash 's bridge was replaced with the present cast-iron Hornsey Lane Bridge , designed by Sir Alexander Binnie , accessible from the Archway Road level by a steep flight of steps . Hornsey Lane Bridge is informally called \" Suicide Bridge \" as it is a known suicide spot . It was the venue for the mental illness campaign group Mad Pride 's inaugural vigil in 2000 , and was the subject of Johnny Burke 's 2006 film The Bridge . When , at the end of 2010 , three men in three weeks committed suicide by jumping from the bridge , a campaign was set up by local residents for better anti-suicide measures to be put in place . Hornsey Lane and the bridge marks the boundary between the Inner London Borough of Islington and the Outer London Borough of Haringey . An inquiry was held into widening the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971 . It was originally intended to widen a further section of the road , but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978 , and a second inquiry in 1984 , chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings , was also abandoned . The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981 , but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day . When originally constructed , Archway Road went through countryside with few buildings - though by 1828 the Woodman pub at the junction with Muswell Hill Road , and the now demolished Wellington pub at the junction with North Hill provided refreshments to travellers ; however , with the coming of the railways in 1867 ribbon development started along the road , including the Camra Heritage listed Winchester Tavern with the distinctive attached parade of shops and house with deep arched eaves built by the Imperial Property Investment Co in 1881 . At the northern end of Archway Road , the road re-intersects with the traditional Great North Road route ( at this point called North Hill ) . The roads almost immediately re-diverge , with the Great North Road route heading north as the A1000 towards Finchley , Whetstone and Barnet and the A1 heading west as Aylmer Road . Aylmer Road is a very short stretch of road , running west for less than half a mile between the junction with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet . The entire southern side of the road is taken up by Highgate Golf Course , while the northern side is a mixture of small shops , flats and allotments . The road is named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer , VC KCB , who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891 . = = = Barnet = = = After crossing The Bishops Avenue , the A1 becomes Lyttelton Road , which was laid out in 1931 as part of the residential development of the area , and runs east \u2013 west along the northern foot of Highgate Hill between Hampstead Garden Suburb and East Finchley . It is for the most part residential ; on the northern side stands the Belvedere Court block of flats . Built with the road in the 1930s , the building is now Grade II Listed as an example of 1930s architecture . After passing playing fields to the south , the A1 briefly becomes Market Place , a former street market that has evolved into a short stretch of shops , then becomes Falloden Way \u2013 built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a programme of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb , and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook , a tributary of the River Brent , which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length . The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks , whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook , and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood \u2013 two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London . The A1 merges with the North Circular Road ( A406 ) and the two routes run briefly together , crossing over the Henlys Corner interchange . Henlys Corner is a junction with the 1820s turnpike road , Finchley Road , which was built to provide a by-pass to the route north from London through Hampstead ; the name changes to Regents Park Road on the northern , Finchley , side of the junction . The junction had an \u00a3 8 million upgrade completed in January 2012 , which included Britain 's first \" hands-free \" pedestrian crossing to allow Orthodox Jews to reach the nearby Finchley Synagogue , one of Europe 's largest , without operating machinery on the Sabbath . While a synagogue has stood on the site since 1935 , the current building dates from 1967 . After the Henlys Corner interchange , the routes diverge , with the A406 going south to Brent Cross , while the A1 turns north-west as Great North Way through the leafy suburbs of Mill Hill and Hendon . Great North Way , built in 1926 , joins Watford Way carrying the A41 , completed in 1927 , at Fiveways Corner , and in 1970 a junction with the M1 motorway was created . The A41 and A1 continue together as Watford Way via Mill Hill Circus to Apex Corner , where they separate , with the A41 turning west , and the A1 turning to run straight north . After passing Apex Corner , the A1 runs north and out of London as the dual carriageway Barnet Way / Barnet Bypass . This dual carriageway was part of a 1920 \u2013 4 road improvement programme that was mentioned in parliament in 1928 as hopefully being completed by the end of that summer . The northbound carriageway passes the entrance to Scratchwood , an area of ancient forest which is now a local nature reserve , then crosses the A411 from Watford to Barnet at the Stirling Corner roundabout . A 0.6 miles ( 0.97 km ) proposed link road at this roundabout , estimated at \u00a3 22.8m in 1987 , would have provided access to the M1 , but the plans were subsequently abandoned . The link had been planned during discussions for the Hendon Urban Motorway , which was intended to carry the M1 all the way down to Hyde Park Corner as part of the London Ringways scheme ; the interchange would have been junction 3 on the motorway ; which is currently the unnumbered junction for London Gateway services . Past Stirling Corner , the A1 skirts Borehamwood , before turning northeast and running through open countryside to Bignell 's Corner . At Bignell 's Corner the A1 crosses under the M25 motorway at a large roundabout near South Mimms services . North of Bignell 's Corner the A1 becomes the A1 ( M ) motorway for a while , and follows the Great North Road route , running north to Edinburgh . = = Construction = = The A1 route was designated in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme . Through the inner boroughs of the City , Islington , and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets ; when it reaches what is now the outer London borough of Barnet , some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built , and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways . In 1828 , John Benjamin Macneill , chief engineer to Thomas Telford , used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1 , an innovative technique that was used there for the first time , and is the basis for modern road building .",

                    "text": "HMS Renown ( 1895 ) = HMS Renown was a second-class predreadnought battleship built for the Royal Navy in the early 1890s . Intended to command cruiser squadrons operating on foreign stations , the ship served as the flagship of the North America and West Indies Station and the Mediterranean Fleet early in her career . Becoming obsolete as cruiser speeds increased , Renown became a royal yacht and had all of her secondary armament removed to make her more suitable for such duties . She became a stoker 's training ship in 1909 and was listed for disposal in 1913 . The ship was sold for scrap in early 1914 . = = Design and description = = Production of a new 12-inch gun was behind schedule and the three battleships planned for the 1892 Naval Programme that were intended to use the new gun had to be delayed . In their stead , an improved Centurion-class battleship design was chosen to keep the workers at Pembroke Dockyard fully employed . No formal requirement for a second-class battleship suitable for use as the flagship on foreign stations or to reinforce cruiser squadrons existed at the time , but the decision to build the ship was strongly influenced by the views of the Controller of the Navy , Rear Admiral John A. \" Jacky \" Fisher and the Director of Naval Intelligence , Captain Cyprian Bridge who favoured smaller ships with a smaller main armament and large secondary armament . They pressed for additional ships of this type as substitutes for the two other battleships originally programmed , but this was rejected by the Admiralty as there was no demand for additional second-class battleships . The Director of Naval Construction , William Henry White , submitted three designs in early April 1892 and the smallest one was chosen on 11 April . The design was quite innovative in several different ways . It was the first battleship to use Harvey armour , which allowed the secondary casemates to be armoured , the first to use a sloping armour deck and the first to provide armoured shields over the main armament . = = = General characteristics = = = Renown had an overall length of 412 feet 3 inches ( 125.7 m ) , a beam of 72 feet 4 inches ( 22.0 m ) , and a draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8.3 m ) at deep load . She displaced 11,690 long tons ( 11,880 t ) at normal load and 12,865 long tons ( 13,071 t ) at deep load . The ship had a metacentric height of 3.75 feet ( 1.1 m ) at deep load . In 1903 , the crew numbered between 651 and 674 officers and enlisted men . She was considered to handle well by her captains and was a good sea-boat . In view of her intended duties abroad , her bottom was coppered to reduce biofouling . = = = Propulsion = = = Renown was powered by two three-cylinder vertical triple-expansion steam engines , each driving a single propeller . Steam for the engines was provided by eight cylindrical boilers at a working pressure of 155 psi ( 1,069 kPa ; 11 kgf / cm2 ) . The engines were designed to produce a total of 10,000 indicated horsepower ( 7,500 kW ) which was intended to allow her to reach a speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . The engines proved to be more powerful than anticipated and Renown reached 18.75 knots ( 34.73 km / h ; 21.58 mph ) during sea trials under forced draught . The ship carried a maximum of 1,890 long tons ( 1,920 t ) of coal , enough to steam 6,400 nautical miles ( 11,900 km ; 7,400 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . = = = Armament = = = She was armed with four 40-calibre , breech-loading 10-inch Mk III guns in two twin-gun barbettes , one forward and one aft . Each gun was provided with 105 shells per gun . Her secondary armament consisted of ten QF ( quick-firing ) 6-inch Mk II guns . Half a dozen of these guns were mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull and the remaining guns were mounted on the upper deck in casemates in the superstructure . Defence against torpedo boats was provided by a dozen QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns . Eight of these were mounted on the upper deck amidships . They fired 3-inch ( 76 mm ) , 12.5-pound ( 5.7 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2,548 ft / s ( 777 m / s ) . 200 rounds per gun were carried by each ship . Renown also carried eight QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns . Each gun was provided with 500 rounds of ammunition . She had five 18-inch torpedo tubes , one in the stern above water and two on each broadside underwater . = = = Armour = = = The ship 's armour was generally composed of Harvey steel and her waterline main belt was 6 \u2013 8 inches ( 152 \u2013 203 mm ) thick . It was 210 feet ( 64.0 m ) long amidships and 7.5 feet ( 2.3 m ) high of which 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) was below the waterline at normal load . Fore and aft oblique bulkheads , 10 inches ( 254.0 mm ) and 6 inches ( 152 mm ) ] thick , connected the belt armour to the barbettes . The upper strake of six-inch armour was 180 feet ( 54.9 m ) long and 6.75 feet ( 2.1 m ) high . It covered the ship 's side between the rear of the barbettes up to the level of the main deck . Oblique bulkheads six inches thick connected the upper armour to the barbettes . Renown was the first British battleship to be built with a sloped armoured deck behind the main belt as was commonly used on British protected cruisers . The top of the protective deck was even with the top of the main armoured belt and sloped down at 45 \u00b0 angle to meet the bottom of the belt . It was 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick on the flat and 3 inches ( 76 mm ) on the slope and ran between the barbettes . Outside the barbettes , the lower deck was three inches thick and ran towards the ends of the ship . The barbettes were protected by 10-inch ( 254 mm ) armour plates . The gun turrets that protected the main armament were six inches thick on their face , with three-inch sides and a 1-inch ( 25 mm ) roof . They were initially built without a rear plate because of weight distribution problems with the turrets . The upper deck casemates were protected by 4-inch ( 102 mm ) plates on the front and sides , but the main deck casemates had six-inch faces and sides . The stern torpedo tube was protected by a mantlet three to six inches thick . The sides of the forward conning tower were 9 inches ( 229 mm ) thick while those of the rear conning tower were only three inches in thickness . = = Construction and career = = Renown was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 1 February 1893 and launched on 8 May 1895 . She was completed in January 1897 at a cost of \u00a3 751,206 , but then underwent lengthy sea trials that included the changing of her propeller blades that lasted until June . The ship commissioned on 8 June 1897 and served as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief , Vice Admiral Sir Nowell Salmon , VC , on 26 June , at the Fleet Review at Spithead for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria , with the Prince of Wales aboard . She was briefly attached to the 1st Division , of the Channel Squadron , from 7 to 12 July for manoeuvres off the south coast of Ireland . On 24 August , Renown became Fisher 's flagship , relieving the protected cruiser Crescent as flagship of the North America and West Indies Station . The ship continued as such until beginning a refit in May 1899 . Upon completion of her refit in July , she transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet , once again becoming Fisher 's flagship . A strong proponent of the design of Renown , Fisher also found her highly desirable for the hosting of the social events required of a flagship in peacetime . Captain Hugh Tyrwhitt was appointed in command on 19 March 1900 . Renown also underwent a special refit at Malta from February to May 1900 to meet Fisher 's requirements for her . This included the transfer of the main deck 12-pounders to the superstructure . The ship recommissioned on 19 November 1900 , and served as flagship until Fisher ended his tour as Commander-in-Chief on 4 June 1902 , after which she continued to serve in the Mediterranean Fleet as a private ship under a new captain , Arthur Murray Farquhar . Renown participated in combined manoeuvres off Cephalonia and Morea between 29 September and 6 October 1902 . After the manoeuvres ended , she was detached from the Mediterranean Fleet and returned to the United Kingdom to be specially fitted out at Portsmouth to carry the Duke and Duchess of Connaught on a royal tour of India . These modifications included removal of the main deck six-inch guns . After the modifications , she was nicknamed the \" Battleship Yacht . \" Renown carried the Duke and Duchess on their royal tour of India from November 1902 to March 1903 . The ship rejoined the Mediterranean Fleet in April . In August , she relieved Venerable as flagship of the fleet so that the latter ship could undergo a refit . From 5 to 9 August 1903 , Renown participated in manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal . Renown was placed into reserve at Devon on 15 May 1904 , although she participated in manoeuvers the following month . On 21 February 1905 , the ship began a special refit at Portsmouth to configure her as a royal yacht . During the refit , the remainder of her secondary armament was removed to increase her accommodations . On 8 October , Renown left Portsmouth bound for Genoa , Italy . At Genoa , the Prince and Princess of Wales \u2014 the future King George V and Queen Mary \u2014 embarked for a royal tour of India . The first-class protected cruiser Terrible escorted the ship during the tour . At the conclusion of the tour , Renown departed Karachi on 23 March 1906 and arrived at Portsmouth on 7 May . She was placed into reserve on 31 May . In May 1907 , Renown was attached to the Home Fleet as a \" subsidiary yacht \" . Between October and December 1907 , Renown carried King Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain on an official trip to and from the United Kingdom . The ship was transferred to the 4th Division , Home Fleet , at Portsmouth on 1 April 1909 . Five months later , 25 September , she began a refit in Portsmouth Dockyard to convert her for use as a stoker 's training ship . Renown briefly served as a tender to HMS Victory in October before her refit was completed in November . During the Coronation Review at Spithead on 24 June 1911 for King George V , the ship was used as an accommodation ship . She was slightly damaged when water tanker Aid rammed her on 26 November 1911 . Renown was offered for sale on 31 January 1913 and partially dismantled . In December 1913 , she was moored at the Motherbank , awaiting disposal , and on 2 April 1914 she was sold for scrap at a price of \u00a3 39,000 . She was broken up at Blyth .",

The District of Keewatin was created by the passage of the Keewatin Act on October 7 , 1876 from a portion of Canada 's North West Territories . Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris convinced the government that the new territorial government of the North West Territories would be unable to effectively administer land to the north and east of Manitoba . Shortly after the District of Keewatin was formed a large group of Icelanders arrived , infected with smallpox which quickly spread to the indigenous First Nation population . The Government of Canada allowed the Council to be formed for the purpose of containing the smallpox epidemic . The Council also administered Indian treaty claims , immigrant land claims , Hudson 's Bay Company trading post concerns as well as policing and health care . The Council lasted from November 25 , 1876 , until April 16 , 1877 , after which control of the territory was returned under federal jurisdiction . The founder of the Council of Keewatin as well as the District of Keewatin was Alexander Morris . He selected and appointed the members to serve after being given permission by the Government of Canada . After the Council was disbanded in 1877 , the legislation passed and departments organized by the council , such as the Boards of Health and Quarantine , continued to remain in force as late as 1878 . The council was not reconstituted before the District of Keewatin was ceded back to the Northwest Territories in 1905 . All matters of administration were handled by the Government of Canada and the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba . = = Location = = The new district of Keewatin was separate from the North West Territories . Keewatin was an area extending north of the \" postage stamp \" province of Manitoba and the Canada \u2013 United States border , to the northern shores of Canada . To the west was the North-West Territories , to the east Ontario and again the North-West Territories . The Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba , Alexander Morris , served ex officio as Lieutenant Governor of the district . = = History = = = = = Treaty 5 land negotiations = = = Morris had fully expected the Sandy Bar Saulteaux to sign Treaty 5 , The Lake Winnipeg Treaty in 1875 . The purpose of the treaty would be to free up lands for immigration and settlement were then inhabited by the First Nations people . In return the First Nations would be granted reserve land , $ 5.00 per person annual payment , two oxen , one bull and four cows for each band , an annual payment of $ 50.00 salary for the Chief and three executive officers amounting to $ 70.00 total , as well as agricultural implements . The Chief also received a flag and medal . = = = Icelandic land grant = = = Icelanders emigrated from Iceland due to volcanic eruptions and shortage of grasslands , as well as a population increase which limited access to resources . Canada was attracting immigrants with land to settle western Canada in this era . Lord Dufferin , Governor General of Canada , and Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris granted the Icelanders territory at Sandy Bar , south of the Icelandic River . Between 235 and 285 Icelanders arrived at Willowpoint near Gimli on October 21 , 1875 ; later that summer 1200 new immigrants from Iceland joined them . The Icelandic settlers elected a provisional town council of five members for the colony administration . The Dominion Government granted free transportation within Canada and settlement rights for a reserve known as New Iceland ( N\u00fdja \u00cdsland ) , established by an Order in Council . 27,000 acres ( 110 km2 ) was set aside for the New Iceland territory , which comprised 57.9 kilometres ( 36.0 mi ) astride the western shore of Lake Winnipeg between Boundary Creek and White Mud River ( Icelandic River ) inclusive of Big Island ( Hecla Island ) . The Canadian government also promised the Icelanders local self-government , laws and judicial system and maintenance of their own school system . The Icelanders received a loan , which was offered to the settlement in stages . $ 15,000 was allotted to the first arrivals of 1875 . Then a loan of $ 5,000 was extended to the summer immigrants to cover the cost of tickets , and $ 8,000 for agricultural tools and provisions . An extra $ 9,000 was paid to cover travel costs and three months provisions . $ 25,000 was received in April which was used for seed and livestock : 250 head of cattle were purchased . October saw another loan of $ 18,000 for winter provisions , and 100 cows . Altogether , $ 80,000 was loaned to the Icelandic settlers , for which the 160 acres ( 65 ha ) of settlement lands per settler was used as collateral . Their local council was dissolved on April 12 , 1876 , when the District of Keewatin was established by the Dominion Government under the North-West Territories Act . At this same time the territory of New Iceland underwent an official transfer to the District of Keewatin . = = = Land claim dispute = = = A land claim dispute arose between the Saulteaux family of John Ramsay and the Icelandic family of \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson . The Saulteaux believed the boundary line between the settlements was at the south shore of the river . \u00d3lafur \u00d3lafsson constructed his cabin on the river 's north shore . J.A.N. Provencher supported \u00d3lafsson . Ramsay brought his claim to Morris . Ramsay had recently lost his wife and four of his five children to smallpox and wanted the Saulteaux title to be recognized . The surveyor general and the Indian Affairs Department deputy superintendent both agreed that Ramsay was entitled to the land under the Indian Act . Treaty 5 was not signed by the Sandy Bar Saulteaux until 1876 , after all appeals to federal agents regarding land claims failed . = = = Smallpox = = = The District of Keewatin had a severe epidemic of smallpox that started shortly after the territory 's creation in the settlements of Gimli and Sandy Bar . The disease originated from a large group of Icelandic settlers who settled on the west shore of Lake Winnipeg . The Icelanders thought the first appearance of the epidemic was chickenpox and so it was not recognized as a deadly smallpox epidemic . The epidemic quickly spread to the local native population who were the predominant inhabitants of the territory . = = Council formation = = The Council of Keewatin was created and its first and only members were appointed and sworn in on November 25 , 1876 , by Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris . Morris sent word to Ottawa by telegraph on November 24 , 1876 , asking for permission to set up the Council . The federal government responded quickly , allowing appointments and a proclamation to be printed the next day . Members of the Legislative Council were entitled to use the prefix The Honourable for the duration of their appointments . The first session of the Council opened on November 30 , 1876 , with Morris delivering the only throne speech . He emphasized the impending need for the council to deal with the smallpox epidemic in the fledgling territory . He detailed the history of the Temporary North-West Council , why the District of Keewatin was created , and outlined the powers of the Council of Keewatin . The council sat in Fort Garry , Manitoba even though this was outside of the boundaries of the District of Keewatin . Morris determined during the creation of the territory that the affairs of the District of Keewatin should be administered from Fort Garry until November 7 , 1876 . A total of six members were appointed to the Council . The law that created the territory allowed for a minimum of five members . William Hespeler was appointed to serve on the Executive Council as a cabinet minister serving Lieutenant Governor Morris . His portfolio gave him the title of Territorial Immigration Agent . This office was needed to put measures and people in place to control access by settlers in the territory to help quarantine the smallpox epidemic . The other members of the council were all chosen for their medical knowledge rather than a political background . The Council met at Early Government House in Fort Garry , which was also the home of Alexander Morris . The only clerk and secretary appointed to serve the council was F.G. Becher . The Council chose William Osborne Smith to chair the proceedings of the Council as well as the Board of Health . = = = Emergency quarantine = = = Fearing the disease would spread to Manitoba and the North West Territories , Morris advised the Department of the Interior that a territorial government needed to be set up to deal with the crisis . Morris appointed Dr Lynch to care for the Saulteaux smallpox epidemic . Sigtryggur Jonasson visited John Taylor to seek help , returning to New Iceland on November 8 , 1877 . Drs David Young , James S. Lynch , and A. Baldwin arrived at New Iceland and placed the area under quarantine as of November 27 , 1876 . A hospital was established in Gimli , Keewatin and a quarantine station at Netley Creek . The Grassy Narrows House , a Hudson 's Bay \" outpost \" also became an emergency hospital during the epidemic . The nearby Sandy Bar Band first nation community at Riverton was reached by Lynch and Young , and had been abandoned . The buildings were burned to contain the smallpox epidemic . Following the trail , they found the remaining 17 residents of the Sandy Bar band of about 60 people . The Sandy Bar Band fled to the east shore of Lake Winnipeg . This spread the epidemic and infected any bands living there . Ramsay guided the doctor to the various bands . At Sandy River 200 dead bodies were found . The Hudson 's Bay Company warehouse , houses and teepees were all burned . After the throne speech was read on November 30 , 1876 , the council of Keewatin got to work quickly and passed its first piece of legislation . The Act was entitled An Act respecting Small Pox , and it served as the centrepiece of the council . The Act defined penalties and provisions to enforce Morris ' proclamation outlawing intercourse by people outside the infected zone who did not have permission from the Council . The Act also offered advice and procedures for medical treatment of the disease . For the entire lifespan of the Council , all acts and regulations passed were geared towards dealing with smallpox . Everyone who wanted to do business with or visit the infected areas had to obtain permission from the council . By April 1877 , the smallpox epidemic abated , however the quarantine remained until June 20 , 1877 . The Icelanders demonstrated to Netley Creek , the southern border of New Island , requesting an end to the quarantine , which had been lifted the previous day , June 19 . Of the 1200 Icelandic settlers , 102 died of smallpox . Many of the immigrants had been immunized in Iceland before they travelled to Canada . = = = The fur trade = = = During the short existence of the Council , it became involved with regulating the fur trade . The Council feared furs contaminated with smallpox would be exported outside the quarantine zone . The Council invited people involved in the fur trade from Keewatin , Manitoba , and even the United States government to discuss the matter . The purpose of the meeting was to solicit testimony and gain the support of the industry , so that the Council could effectively draft , implement and enforce legislation . The Council passed an Act on February 26 , 1877 , which was subsequently given Royal Assent . The measures adopted effectively quarantined furs from areas of the district deemed infected , and prevented their export . However furs from areas in the District of Keewatin deemed to be free of smallpox could be exported as long as they did not come into contact with infected furs . Before being exported from the district , all furs had to pass through depots manned by a quarantine officer appointed by the Board of Health . Any furs believed to have come into contact with parts of the district infected by smallpox were to be destroyed . This led to some problems for the Government of Canada after the Council was dissolved . Some people whose furs had been destroyed under these regulations applied to the Government for compensation , as no mechanism was put in place when the Act was drafted . These claims for compensation were considered , but ultimately ignored . The Hudson 's Bay Company had lost a full year in the northern fur trade , and pressed for further steps to be taken to prevent another smallpox outbreak . Dr. D.W.J. Hagarty was appointed as medical superintendent of the Manitoba and North-West Superintendencies in October 1878 . His mission was to vaccinate all Native persons resident in the Manitoba Superintendency . Every spring vaccinations were administered to thoe people who were not away hunting . = = = Board of Health = = = The Council of Keewatin established a powerful Board of Health for the territory . The Board of Health was run out of a head office in the city of Winnipeg and a local office was also established at the town of Gimli , in the District of Keewatin . The Board of Health was led by Chief Health Officer Walter R. Nursey . All matters regarding quarantine within the district were handled by Edmund A. Struthers . The board was established to confine and treat the smallpox epidemic in the territory , and had wide powers to carry out this mission . The Board of Health established vaccination programs among native populations in the District of Keewatin based on legislation that continued well after the Council was dissolved . Mr Nursey was despatched by Governor Morris in February 1877 with a quarantine party to Lake Winnipeg to establish a northern quarantine and sanitary cordon between the City of Winnipeg and the infected area . This party was to regulate the traffic in fur as well . The party arrived at Dog Head outpost in May 1877 , having travelled the winter months by foot . There were no supplies , money or instruction on arrival . The quarantine party returned to Winnipeg in July 1877 half starved . = = Dissolution = = The council was short-lived : there was just one legislative session . Less than a year after its formation , the smallpox crisis in the District of Keewatin subsided . The Department of the Interior determined that a territorial government for the district was no longer needed . The entire council resigned and was effectively dissolved after being requested to do so on April 16 , 1877 , by Secretary of State James Aikins . Aikins had the council resign as a cost-saving measure ; also he did not want members of the council to abuse the powers of their appointments . Control of the District of Keewatin returned to the federal government under the management of the Department of the Interior in cooperation with the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba . The council was not reconstituted until the remaining portions of the territory were once again merged with the Northwest Territories in 1905 . The land formally comprising the territory is today governed by the provincial and territorial governments of Ontario , Manitoba and Nunavut . = = Debate of the Senate of the Dominion of Canada = = On February 25 , 1878 , the Honourable Mr Girard presented to the Governor-General the correspondence between the Government of Canada , the Council of Keewatin , and the Government of Manitoba regarding the smallpox claims and accounts . The Honourable Mr Pelletier replied that the accounts were examined by Honourables Mr. Norquay and Mr. Begg representing the Province of Manitoba , and Messrs. McCall and Graham representing the Dominion Government . The resolution would be that the Government of Keewatin ( Dominion Government ) would pay $ 20,000 and the Government of Manitoba $ 5,000 in settlement of claims . $ 20,000 is equivalent to $ 490 thousand in present-day terms and $ 5,000 is equivalent to $ 123 thousand . = = New Iceland = = New Iceland elected administrators again on February 13 , 1877 . Under the provisional constitution , the colony was named Vatnsthing ( Lake assembly ) . It was divided into four districts each with its own administration : Vidinesbyggd ( Willow Point District ) , Arnesbyggd ( Arnes District ) , Flotsbyggd ( River District ) and Mikleyjarbyggd ( Big Island District ) . When the quarantine ended in July 1877 , it was too late to seed . The Federal government voted to survey a road in the colony , with an allotment of $ 8,000 to employ labourers . Workers were paid 60 to 70 cents a day along with their daily expenses . The women looking after camps were also similarly paid . This monetary income enabled settlers to remain at New Iceland till the following agricultural season of 1878 . New Iceland became a part of the province of Manitoba in 1881 . This regional Icelandic government continued until 1887 . = = First Nation = = During Treaty 5 negotiations , Norway House Band requested the Grassey Narrows area which was the White Mud River \u2013 Icelandic River area which was a portion of New Iceland . The Norway House Band ( Kinosao Sipi Cree Nation ) agreed to settle at Fisher River . Norway House Band was a Western Woods Cree community of the Algonquian ( Central ) language group . The Sandy Bar group wanted also a reserve in the Grassey Narrows area . Their settlement area was on the northern edge of New Iceland . The Sandy Bar saulteaux / Cree of the Algonquian ( Central ) language group may have been a portion of the Peguis-St. Peters Band . This group was almost entirely decimated during the smallpox epidemic , those who were left were re-located . The Island band requested a reserve on Big Island ( later renamed Hecla Island ) . This band settled at Hollow Water River and renounced the traditional lands at Big Island . Blood Vein River , Big Island , Sandy Bar , Thickfoot and Jack-Fish Head bands met with Messrs. Reid and Howard in October 1876 and requested lands for their reserves . The Dog Head Band requested a point opposite the Dog Head River . Similarly the Blood Vein River Band made a request for lands at the mouth of the Blood Vein River . The Big Island Band at this time requested the lands at the mouth of Badthroat River . The Jack-Fish Head Band made requests for the north side of Jack Head Point at the Lobstick River . The Sandy Bar Band , a branch of St. Peter 's Band requested White Mud River site on the west Side of Lake Winnipeg . The Blood Vein River Band was a Saulteaux ( Ojibwa ) first nation of the Algonquian ( Central ) language family . The Moose Lake ( Big Island ) band which signed Treaty 5 in 1875 was a Cree first nation of the Algonquian ( Central ) language group . The Big Island band which signed Treaty 2 in 1877 was an Ojibwa first nation of the Algonquian ( Central ) language group .",

                    "text": "Halo 4 : Forward Unto Dawn = Halo 4 : Forward Unto Dawn is a military science fiction web series set in the universe of the Halo franchise . Forward Unto Dawn consists of five 15-minute episodes released weekly starting on October 5 , 2012 , and was later released as a single film on DVD and Blu-ray and was later put on Netflix in 2013 . The series was produced as a marketing effort for the video game Halo 4 intended to widen the audience of the Halo series and as a stepping stone to a potential Halo film . It was written by Aaron Helbing and Todd Helbing , and directed by Stewart Hendler . Forward Unto Dawn was shot in Vancouver over 25 days in May 2012 on a budget just under USD $ 10 million . It has just under 500 shots with computer generated imagery , approximately a quarter of what a feature film would have , but the visual effects received praise from reviewers . A coming-of-age story , Forward Unto Dawn follows a cadet , Thomas Lasky , at a twenty-sixth century military training academy as it is attacked by the Covenant , a religious alliance of aliens . Lasky is unsure of his future within the military but feels pressured to follow in the footsteps of his mother and brother . Lasky and his surviving squad mates are rescued by the Master Chief and , after the death of his romantic interest , Chyler Silva , Lasky is inspired by the Chief to take initiative and aids him in saving the remaining cadets . Forward Unto Dawn received a Streamy Award and several of the crew received awards for their work editing , producing and filming of it . The series also won a Motion Picture Sound Editors Golden Reel Award for sound editing . Reviewers were impressed by the special effects and action-packed second act , but found that the plot was too slow in the first half and most of the characters were under-developed . The series was also nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for main title design . = = Development = = After the success of previous live-action promotional shorts , Landfall and The Life , 343 Industries , the studio in charge of development for the Halo franchise , wanted to use a live action series to appeal to an audience of people unfamiliar with the Halo games . The director of franchise business management at 343 Industries , Matt McClosky , explained the intended audience by saying that , \" You see something that looks like a video game , you 're going to get the same crowd you always get . \" The live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop characters ; the series is used to introduce the character Thomas Lasky to the Halo universe before his role in the video game Halo 4 . The developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than Master Chief ( whose face is never seen ) , to not only convey an understanding of the universe , but to better engage unfamiliar viewers . Microsoft considers the series \" the next step \" between advertising material and a full-length film after the failure of a previous effort , and aimed to produce a standalone series that could be enjoyed without necessarily playing the games . The budget for the series was almost USD $ 10 million , Microsoft 's largest investment in a live-action promotion . Director Stewart Hendler said \" We 're either the best-funded web series of all time , a sort of mid-road healthy TV pilot , or a super-low-budget movie . \" When the idea of directing a video game based web series was pitched to Hendler he declined , saying he was not interested in video game adaptions unless the subject was Halo . Hendler was already a fan of the series , having read the novels and played the games . Potential writers were interviewed by 343 Industries , and some were selected to write a draft of a script . Aaron and Todd Helbing wrote a pitch set on Harvest , the first planet to be attacked by the Covenant ( see Halo : Contact Harvest ) . Although 343 Industries decided not to use it , the Helbing brothers ' script was the most complete and demonstrated the best understanding of the Halo universe so they were chosen to write Forward Unto Dawn . The final plot was developed by 343 Industries , Frank O 'Connor , and the Helbings with the intention of introducing a new character to tie-in to Halo 4 , which their Harvest script did not , and to explore \" the least-well-known part of the Halo universe \" . In addition to providing input on the script , 343 Industries had a representative on set at all times to ensure that the series did not break canon . = = = Shooting and special effects = = = The series was shot over twenty-five days in May 2012 in the forests around Vancouver , at Simon Fraser University and at additional stages in Burnaby . The Herzog and Company production team was in Vancouver for three months with set design by Legacy Effects , the same company that worked on the previous shorts . The Warthog ( a 4WD off-road vehicle with a mounted minigun ) that appears in Forward Unto Dawn is the same one that was produced by Weta Workshop and used in Landfall . Stunt driver Johnathon Kralt found that the prop \" handles the roads extremely well for something that size and that height \" , and the four-wheel steering was an advantage for drifting . Many chase shots were made using a Mercedes-Benz ML 55 pursuit vehicle with a camera boom mounted to the roof . Another rig involved towing the Warthog on a low trailer so that cameras could focus on an actor while the vehicle was being \" driven \" . The visual effects supervisor , John Sullivan , hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 shots with computer generated imagery , between a quarter and a third of what a blockbuster film would feature . The Covenant that appear are all completely computer generated , as is the academy 's space elevator , weapons ' muzzle flashes and a few shots of Master Chief . Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the Master Chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production . One scene involves a Covenant Elite stalking the cadets in the armoury . The geometry of the Elite already exists for the Halo video games but it couldn 't be directly transferable to the Mental Ray renderer so it had to be re-topologized in ZBrush and Maya . The outdoor attack on the academy was filmed at Simon Fraser University and required photogrammetric reconstruction and laser measurement to add the aliens and weapons lighting effects in a convincing manner . A later scene in the forest was too complex to use the same techniques , lacking the geometric shapes of the university campus . Instead , Arc visual effects supervisor Terry Bradley scattered LEDs on the set . By measuring the distance between LEDs the studio could model the area with software , and then used SketchUp and Maya to add the weapons fire . The shattering of the pink \" needles \" fired by the Covenant was rendered in Houdini as the shots hit concrete and Master Chief 's armour . The opening sequences of each episode show Cortana , an artificial intelligence , aboard the spaceship Forward Unto Dawn as she malfunctions . The five sequences were entirely computer generated by Polynoid , the animation team of Blacklist , a production company . = = Setting = = Forward Unto Dawn takes place on a fictional planet , Circinius-IV , one of many that humans have colonized outside of the solar system . The protagonist , Thomas Lasky , is aboard a spaceship named Infinity in 2557 . Forward Unto Dawn portrays his memory of the events on Circinius-IV in 2526 , when he is a cadet at the Corbulo Academy , a training facility for the children of high-ranking UNSC officers . The UNSC is training the cadets for war with insurrectionists on various colony planets . A Covenant army attacks the academy causing confusion and panic . Although not made clear in Forward Unto Dawn , the Covenant are a theocratic collection of alien species that are religiously offended by Humanity and seek to eradicate it . The events portrayed in Forward Unto Dawn are some of the earliest encounters with the Covenant , and the characters other than Master Chief were unaware of their existence . = = Casting and characters = = The production team was responsible for casting , but Microsoft maintained a final say . The decision to use Alex Puccinelli instead of Steve Downes , the previous voice artist of Master Chief , was approved by Microsoft . The actors playing the cadets attended a boot camp before shooting to raise their fitness and accustom them to assault courses and rifle drills in their armour costumes . Cast members drove themselves to overexertion in the training , causing some to vomit , which they saw as a bonding experience . Tom Green plays the protagonist Thomas Lasky , a cadet at Corbulo Academy and Ty Olsson plays the adult rendition . Lasky is \" ambivalent about his role in the military \" , considering diplomacy a better option to warfare . Lasky is from a military family ; his mother is a colonel and his brother Cadmon ( played by Max Carver ) was an ODST ( Orbital Drop Shock Troopers - a special forces unit in the Halo universe ) , but Thomas is uninterested in becoming an officer . Green portrayed Lasky as a \" regular teenager \" , unsure of his future . As research for the role , Green was required to watch the previous shorts and read the \" Halo encyclopedia \" that 343 Industries uses to preserve the Halo canon . Executive producer Josh Feldman considers Lasky an important character in the Halo universe beyond just Forward Unto Dawn and Halo 4 . Daniel Cudmore was cast to play the role of Master Chief largely due to his height and physique . The director , Stewart Hendler , wanted to contrast the size of Master Chief to that of the teenage cadets ; Cudmore is 203 centimetres ( 6 ' 8 \" ) tall whereas the actors playing the cadets were deliberately chosen to be \" short , scrawny freshmen \" . In order to accurately portray Master Chief , Cudmore watched the Landfall shorts by Neill Blomkamp and read the Halo novels for the history of the character , having already played the games . Cudmore expressed interest in the history of Master Chief , the character 's view on war and his role as a soldier , as he was only required to portray a utilitarian character in the series . Cudmore thinks the character is torn between aiding the cadets and completing his mission , but Master Chief 's confidence and actions inspire the cadets . Legacy Effects took a body scan of Cudmore , then overlaid a 3D model provided by Microsoft and edited it to get proportions correct . A prototype was 3D printed and then used to make moulds for the final suit . The majority of the suit is rubber over a foam bodysuit , similar to a wetsuit , with a fibreglass helmet . Cudmore compared wearing it to walking through water , although he had to perform stunts in the suit as it was made only for his body . Cudmore repeatedly watched the video of his movements immediately after they were shot to ensure that they were deliberate but without appearing robotic , \" trying to make his movements a little larger than life , but still with a sense of humanity to them . \" Both Hendler and Frank O 'Connor praised Cudmore , not just for his physique but for moving in a fluid manner in the cumbersome suit . Anna Popplewell plays Chyler Silva , a cadet who , contrary to Lasky 's beliefs , is a full supporter of the war against the insurrectionists . Popplewell portrays Silva as a competent cadet who has been hardened by her childhood surrounded by insurrectionist violence . She had a romantic connection with Lasky that was interrupted by the Covenant attack . Popplewell was new to the Halo series when cast for the role but thinks that the characters and aesthetic of the series have the potential to draw in a new audience . Other characters include cadets April Orenski , a senior cadet and squad leader , played by Enisha Brewster , Junjie Chen , played by Osric Chau , who is the only cadet without a military family and has gained entry to the academy through his own achievements , Dimah Tchakova played by Kat de Lieva , Walter Vickers played by Iain Belcher and Michael Sullivan , played by Masam Holden . = = Episodes = = = = Release = = On April 30 , 2012 , Microsoft Studios announced that Forward Unto Dawn would play on Machinima Prime and Halo Waypoint ( a marketing website for the Halo series ) during the weeks leading up to the release of Halo 4 . The series ' first episode attracted five million views on YouTube within two weeks and , as of March 2013 , has eleven million views . The second episode attracted three million views within two weeks and six million views by March 2013 ; however , these statistics do not include views on Halo Waypoint . The series consists of five 15-minute shorts , the first released on October 5 , 2012 , with subsequent episodes released weekly . A 90-minute extended version is included with the Limited Edition version of Halo 4 , and became available on Blu-ray , DVD , Xbox Video , iTunes and video on demand services on December 4 , 2012 . The Blu-ray and DVD versions contain bonus features including audio commentary from Stewart Hendler and 343 Industries , a live-action Red vs. Blue PSA entitled Sleeper , as well as vignettes and making-of documentaries . On January 18 , 2013 , Content Media Corporation announced that they had international distribution rights for Forward Unto Dawn for television . McFarlane Toys produced 500 units of a collectible statue to tie-in with Forward Unto Dawn in December 2012 . The statue is a thirty-six centimetre ( 14 \" ) tall model of Master Chief fighting a Hunter , as depicted in Forward Unto Dawn . On November 6 , 2012 , to coincide with the release of Halo 4 , Mega Bloks released a model of the UNSC spaceship , Forward Unto Dawn . The model is approximately one metre ( 3 ' ) long and has scenes from both the video game and the web series . = = Critical reaction = = Reviewers were divided on what standard to expect of the series and what to compare it to ; the budget was beyond that of other web series but not on par with a film . IGN reviewer Jesse Schedeen considered the cadets other than Lasky and Silva to be \" ready-made cannon fodder , \" having received minimal development . This detracted from the quality of the third episode , as a betrayal by cadet Tchakova had little impact due to her shallow development . However , Schedeen did appreciate Green 's acting in the last episode , noting that \" [ Silva 's ] death scene was handled very well , particularly as it forced Tom Green to shed his calm exterior and react much more emotionally . \" In his later review of the Blu-ray , Schedeen complimented the audio and video quality , as well as the inclusion of many vignettes , documentary featurettes and commentaries . James Plath of Movie Metropolis also found the characters lacking in the first half , but noted that in the second half , the characters of Lasky and Silva \" actually move beyond the clich\u00e9s and pick up a personality along the way \" . Plath was impressed by the soundtrack , thinking it \" worthy of any big-screen action flick \" and also complimented the special effects saying \" the CGI work is enhanced by high definition , not exposed by it . \" Overall however , he thought that despite the action being exciting , the \" pedestrian \" first half and \" only adequate acting \" would prevent Forward Unto Dawn appealing to an audience beyond existing gamers . Official Xbox Magazine 's reviewer , Edwin Evans , appreciated the direction of the series ; \" Stewart Hendler 's well-judged editing keeps the script from sinking under the weight of its own melodrama , and his close-ups never overstay their welcome , hiding the weaknesses of the inexperienced ( but talented ) cast . \" He also echoed Plath 's thoughts on the slow first half and exciting second half . = = Awards and nominations = =",

It took place on August 30 , 1993 , at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills , Michigan . All three championships were defended at SummerSlam . The Steiner Brothers defended the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Heavenly Bodies , and Shawn Michaels defended the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Mr. Perfect . The main event saw Lex Luger challenge Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . In addition to the title matches , Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler were scheduled to wrestle to settle their feud and determine who would be named \" Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation . \" History of Wrestling gave the event a rating of 54 / 100 in The Complete WWF Video Guide Volume 3 = = Background = = Two of the matches at SummerSlam 1993 were a result of Razor Ramon 's loss to The Kid ( later the 1-2-3 Kid ) on the May 17 , 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw . Following Ramon 's loss to the newcomer , Money Inc . ( Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster ) teased Ramon about the match . DiBiase offered Ramon a job as a servant , which Ramon angrily refused . Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc . DiBiase asked for a singles match against the Kid , and the Kid accepted the challenge . Ramon helped the Kid win the match by distracting DiBiase . It was decided that the feuds would be settled in two singles matches at SummerSlam , with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid . The match between the Steiner Brothers and The Heavenly Bodies received little buildup . The Bodies were a successful tag team in Jim Cornette 's Smoky Mountain Wrestling , and an interpromotional agreement allowed them to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship . The rivalry between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect began at WrestleMania IX . During a fight after the match between Lex Luger and Mr. Perfect , Shawn Michaels appeared and attacked Perfect . Mr. Perfect gained revenge by distracting Michaels at the May 17 , 1993 edition of Monday Night Raw , allowing Marty Jannetty to pin Michaels and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship . Michaels regained the belt the following month with the help of his new bodyguard , Diesel . Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler had a heated feud , stemming from Lawler interrupting Hart 's victory ceremony at the 1993 King of the Ring tournament . Lawler insisted that he was the true king of the WWF and attacked Hart . The feud intensified as Lawler taunted and attacked Bret 's family , including his parents and his younger brother Owen . According to a story relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record , Hart was originally supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . However , the match did not happen because Hogan changed his mind , as he was supposedly not happy with the planned finish . As a result , Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead . Marty Jannetty was originally supposed to face Rick Martel , but Ludvig Borga replaced Martel well before the match . The match received little buildup , although Borga appeared in several vignettes leading up to the match . He criticized the United States for such reasons as its pollution . Jannetty vowed to defend America 's pride in his match against Borga . The buildup for the match between Giant Gonzalez and The Undertaker after the Undertaker had defeated Kamala in a Coffin match at Survivor Series 1992 . Kamala 's manager Harvey Wippleman vowed revenge and introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993 , with Gonzalez attacking and eliminating the Undertaker . Gonzalez and the Undertaker wrestled at WrestleMania IX , and Gonzalez knocked the Undertaker unconscious with a chloroform-soaked rag . The feud intensified when Wippleman , Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes attacked the Undertaker and his manager , Paul Bearer . They stole the urn , the supposed source of the Undertaker 's strength , and used it to assault Paul Bearer , who was not seen again until SummerSlam . The feud came to a head at SummerSlam in a Rest In Peace match . The six-man match at SummerSlam was originally supposed to be a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon . However , Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993 , however , forcing the WWF to change the match . Two reasons have been given for Sherri 's departure : her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests . As a result , Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers . The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline . The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated When Tatanka came to the help of Sherri , who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow . Subsequently , Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some of the hair Tatanka had dyed red as a tribute to his Lumbee heritage . Lex Luger 's rivalry with Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge on the deck of the USS Intrepid . After several wrestlers and other athletes attempted to body slam Yokozuna , Luger arrived in a helicopter . He was able to body slam Yokozuna , which led to a title shot at SummerSlam . To build support for Luger , the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the Lex Express . Yokozuna 's spokesperson , Jim Cornette , agreed to the match , but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions . Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost , and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm . = = Event = = The pay-per-view took place in front of a crowd of 23,954 at the Palace of Auburn Hills . Before the event aired on PPV , \" The Rocket \" Owen Hart defeated longtime jobber Barry Horowitz in a dark match . The first televised match was Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase . DiBiase got off to a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began . Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines . DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover . Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase 's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor 's Edge to get the pin . The Steiner Brothers were the audience favorites in the WWF Tag Team Championship match , as they were defending the belts in their hometown . Before the match began , The Heavenly Bodies attacked them . When the match began , the Bodies executed several double-team maneuvers on Rick Steiner . Scott tagged in and took control of the match . The Bodies soon regained the advantage , and Jim Cornette got involved by hitting Scott in the throat with a tennis racket . Rick tagged back in and hit several Steiner-Lines before Prichard attacked him with Cornette 's tennis racket . Del Ray accidentally hit Prichard with a moonsault , however , allowing Scott to hit a Frankensteiner and Rick to get the pin . The match between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect began with a series of wrestling holds . The match remained primarily technical until Diesel distracted Perfect , allowing Michaels to superkick him in the face . Michaels worked on Perfect 's injured back until Perfect took control of the match . After a series of attacks on Michaels , Perfect used the Perfect Plex . Diesel pulled him out of the ring and threw him into the steel ring steps , however , allowing Michaels to win by countout . Irwin R. Schyster remained in control for the majority of his match against the 1-2-3 Kid . Although the Kid hit several kicks , Schyster regained control every time . Schyster used his usual abdominal stretch while using the ring ropes for leverage before the Kid made a brief comeback by hitting a moonsault . Schyster hit a Write Off , however , and got the pin . Bret Hart came to the ring for his match with Jerry Lawler . Lawler , however , appeared on crutches and claimed that he had been injured in a car accident . He announced that his court jester , Doink the Clown ( portrayed by Matt Osborne ) , would wrestle Hart in his place . Doink threw a bucket of water on Bret 's brother , Bruce Hart , prompting Bret to attack Doink outside of the ring . The match consisted of angry brawling until Doink slowed the pace with a couple of submission holds . After Doink missed a Whoopie Cushion attempt , Bret took full control of the match and locked Doink in the Sharpshooter . With Doink in the sharpshooter , Lawler then attacked Bret with a crutch , revealing that he was not injured and thus causing an unofficial disqualification ( no official announcement was made ) . WWF President Jack Tunney came to the ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in the scheduled match . The match between Lawler and Hart consisted almost exclusively of brawling . The two attacked each other with a milk pail and crutches and traded punches and kicks . Bret used Lawler 's signature move , the piledriver , before putting him in the Sharpshooter . Lawler submitted , but Bret refused to release him for three and a half minutes . The referee then reversed his decision and gave the victory and title of \" Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation \" to Lawler . Ludvig Borga dominated the majority of a squash match against Marty Jannetty . He attacked Jannetty immediately with a series of punches and knees . Jannetty managed a couple of brief comebacks but was unable to mount a serious offense . Borga used his strength to control the match and won the match by submission with a backbreaker . Harvey Wippleman was at ringside with the urn as the Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez . The two wrestlers brawled , using the ring steps and steel chairs . Halfway through the match , Paul Bearer appeared , carrying a black wreath . He attacked Wippleman and took back the urn . The Undertaker quickly took control of the match , attacking Gonzalez with a flying clothesline to win by pinfall . After the match , Gonzalez turned on Wippleman and attacked him with a chokeslam . The next match on the card was the Six-Man tag team match . The Headshrinkers ' manager Afa interfered by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring . At one point , Tatanka looked like he was gaining control , as he began his usual war dance . Bigelow kicked him in the back of the head , however , to end his momentum . Near the end of the match , Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts , but Tatanka rolled out of the way . Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win . Before the main event , Kiotika Suzuki sang the Japanese national anthem . Akio Sato , formerly a member of The Orient Express , was the flag bearer for Yokozuna . Randy Savage then introduced Aaron Neville , who sang the American anthem . The main event began with a stare down . Luger gained the early advantage and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna 's groin . Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna , but the sumo wrestler 's weight was too much . Yokozuna knocked him out of the ring and choked him . Yokozuna had his manager , Mr. Fuji , throw him a salt bucket , which he used to attack Luger . Yokozuna wore Luger down , and after a brief comeback by the all-American , hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop . After Yokozuna missed , Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna , and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved . Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash , and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette . Yokozuna was counted out , but he retained the title because championships change hands only by pinfall or submission . Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red , white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory . = = Aftermath = = The SummerSlam match was DiBiase 's final appearance as a WWF wrestler . He injured his neck and back in January 1994 and was forced to retire from wrestling . Meanwhile , Ramon received a push in Fall 1993 that led to the first of four Intercontinental championships . The Heavenly Bodies did not become serious contenders to the tag team title , and the Steiners soon began a feud with The Quebecers , a new team in the WWF . Shawn Michaels was suspended in late 1993 and forced to vacate the Intercontinental Championship , while Mr. Perfect began a feud with Diesel . The WWF planned to have Perfect and Diesel face each other as part of an elimination match at Survivor Series 1993 , but Mr. Perfect was replaced by Randy Savage at the last minute . Mr. Perfect would not wrestle another pay per view match for the company until Royal Rumble 2002 . The match between Hart and Doink was significant for a couple of reasons . It marked Doink 's final match as a heel , as he turned on Jerry Lawler shortly after the match . In addition , Matt Osborne , who had portrayed Doink since the character 's creation , was fired that fall because of drug problems . The feud between Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart remained unsettled and led to several storylines over the next two years . The final pay per view event featuring this feud was SummerSlam 1995 , which saw Hart beat Lawler 's \" dentist \" Isaac Yankem , D.D.S. Borga received a main event push after his SummerSlam match . After the event , he confronted Luger in the locker room . This began a feud that led to a match between the All-Americans and Foreign Fanatics at Survivor Series 1993 . Luger continued to work as a main event wrestler , although he never won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . He competed in another match with Yokozuna at WrestleMania X after co-winning the 1994 Royal Rumble but was again unsuccessful in taking the belt from Yokozuna . = = Results = = = = Other on-screen talent = =",

It was presented by THQ 's WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 . It was the 21st annual Survivor Series and starred wrestlers from the Raw , SmackDown ! , and ECW brands . The show 's seven matches showcased prominent WWE wrestlers , who acted out the franchise 's stories in and out of the ring . The main event featured SmackDown wrestlers in a Hell in a Cell match , in which the ring was surrounded by a roofed steel structure . In this match , World Heavyweight Champion Batista defeated The Undertaker to retain his title . In Raw 's main match , Randy Orton defeated Shawn Michaels in a singles match , while in ECW 's prime match , ECW Champion CM Punk defeated John Morrison and The Miz in a Triple Threat match to retain the title . Two matches were on the undercard . The first was a singles match , in which The Great Khali defeated Hornswoggle . The other featured Team Triple H ( Triple H , Jeff Hardy , Rey Mysterio and Kane ) defeating Team Umaga ( Umaga , Mr. Kennedy , Montel Vontavious Porter , Finlay and Big Daddy V ) in an inter-brand five-on-four Survivor Series elimination tag team match . Survivor Series helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $ 1.2 million , through ticket sales and pay-per-view buys . It received mixed critical reviews by various independent sources , including Canadian Online Explorer and the Pro Wrestling Torch . After its release on DVD , the event peaked at number five on Billboard 's Video Sales chart , before it fell off the chart after ten weeks . = = Background = = Survivor Series was the culmination of various scripted plots and storylines . For three months before the event , several professional wrestling matches and scripted plots were played out on WWE programming ( Raw , Friday Night SmackDown ! , and ECW on Sci Fi ) to create feuds between various wrestlers , casting them as villains and heroes . Raw , SmackDown ! , and ECW were also the names of WWE 's televised brands \u2013 a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a specific program , thus each brand promoted distinct matches . The main narrative for Survivor Series from the SmackDown brand continues the events that unfolded at WrestleMania 23 , WWE 's April pay-per-view , in which The Undertaker defeated Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship . Over the course of several months , the two wrestlers fought in various matches over the title , which eventually involved Edge . The Undertaker was billed as having been injured in one of these matches in May , in which Edge had won the title . During The Undertaker 's absence , Edge was legitimately injured , and The Great Khali won the championship in a Battle Royal , in which wrestlers were eliminated until one remained as the winner . At Unforgiven , WWE 's September pay-per-view event , The Undertaker returned to WWE , while Batista won the World Heavyweight Title from The Great Khali . Afterwards , the original feud between the two wrestlers was restarted and culminated into a standard wrestling match , known in professional wrestling as a singles match , at WWE 's October pay-per-view event Cyber Sunday ; Batista won this match and retained his title . On the November 2 , 2007 episode of Friday Night SmackDown ! , a rematch was advertised in a Hell in a Cell match , in which both wrestlers would fight in a ring surrounded by a roofed steel structure at Survivor Series . The prime rivalry scripted from the Raw brand continued a storyline that extended from Cyber Sunday , between WWE Champion Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels over Orton 's title . At Cyber Sunday , Michaels was chosen by the WWE fans , via online voting , to face Orton for the title , though , Orton retained his title via disqualification . A rematch was promoted for Survivor Series on the October 29 , 2007 edition of Raw , in which Michaels would face Orton for his title . Afterwards , Michaels and Orton fought in different match types over the weeks leading to Survivor Series . On the episode of Raw before Survivor Series , Michaels and Orton met \" Face to Face \" in a scripted confrontation , in which Orton attacked Michaels . The prime storyline on the ECW brand featured ECW Champion CM Punk , John Morrison , and The Miz . Morrison and Punk 's rivalry revolved over the outcome of their match at Vengeance : Night of Champions , WWE 's June pay-per-view event , in which Morrison defeated Punk to win the ECW Title . Punk sought revenge , but Morrison defeated Punk in two championship matches ; however , Punk won the title from Morrison on the September 4 , 2007 episode of ECW on Sci fi . At Cyber Sunday , The Miz was voted online by fans to challenge Punk for the ECW Title , though , Punk defeated Miz to retain his title . A Triple Threat match was announced for Survivor Series on the November 13 , 2007 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi , in which Punk would defend his title against Morrison and Miz , and the first wrestler to gain a pinfall or submission would win the match and the title . In a narrative extending to the September 10 , 2007 episode of Raw , in which Hornswoggle , a dwarf , was announced as Vince McMahon 's illegitimate son . In this storyline , McMahon did not like the fact that Hornswoggle was his son , and as a result , he promoted matches in which Hornswoggle faced much larger opponents . As part of this storyline , McMahon announced that The Great Khali , who was billed as standing at 7 feet 4 inches ( 2.24 m ) , would face Hornswoggle at Survivor Series . In a promotional in-ring segment on the episode of Friday Night SmackDown ! before the pay-per-view event , Khali and Hornswoggle weighed in for their match , in which Khali weighed double the weight of Hornswoggle ; this was a segment created by McMahon to humiliate his son . As a Survivor Series tradition , every event features an inter-brand 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination tag team match . Announced via WWE.com , WWE 's official website , Team Triple H ( Triple H , The Hardy Boyz ( Matt and Jeff ) , Rey Mysterio , and Kane would face Team Umaga ( Umaga , Montel Vontavious Porter ( MVP ) , Finlay , Big Daddy V , and Mr. Kennedy ) . = = Event = = = = = Preliminary matches = = = The pay-per-view began with the ECW Championship Triple Threat match , in which CM Punk defended his title against John Morrison and The Miz . Throughout the match , The Miz and Morrison double-teamed Punk , however , Miz turned his back on Morrison by attacking him . After Miz tossed Morrison over the top ring ropes onto ringside , Punk lifted Miz onto his shoulders and hit the Go To Sleep . He then pinned Miz to retain his ECW Title . The next scheduled match was an inter-brand 10-Diva tag team match , in which the team of Kelly Kelly , Torrie Wilson , Mickie James , Maria , and Michelle McCool faced Victoria , Beth Phoenix , Melina , Layla , and Jillian Hall . Phoenix 's team had the advantage over James ' team , until James was tagged into the match . She attacked Melina with her forearm and kissed her before kicking her in the head . James then pinned her to earn the victory for her team . Next was a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship , in which the champions , Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defended against Hardcore Holly and Cody Rhodes . At one point , Holly hit Cade with his forearm , and sent Cade and himself onto ringside . In the ring , Murdoch flipped over Rhodes ' back and pulled him down to the mat to perform the \" Ace of Spades \" . Successfully pinning Rhodes , Murdoch retained the World Tag Team Championship for his team . The fourth match was the five-on-five Survivor Series Elimination Tag team match between Team Triple H and Team Umaga . Before the event , it was announced that Matt Hardy would be unable to compete in the match due to a scripted injury . Kane was the first wrestler eliminated off of Team Triple H , after a Big Daddy V elbow drop . Umaga then pinned Rey Mysterio after the \" Samoan Spike \" . Only Jeff and Triple H remained for their team , while MVP was Team Umaga 's first elimination ; Jeff Hardy eliminated him after a \" Twist of Fate \" . Team Umaga 's second elimination occurred after Big Daddy V accidentally dropped an elbow on Mr. Kennedy , which led to a pinfall by Triple H. Big Daddy V was Team Umaga 's third elimination , which occurred after Hardy and Triple H hit a Double DDT . Finlay and Umaga were then eliminated via pinfall , after a \" Pedigree \" to Finlay , and a \" Swanton \" to Umaga . As a result , Team Triple H won . The Great Khali versus Hornswoggle was the next scheduled match . At one point , Hornswoggle tried to hit Khali with a shillelagh , but Khali slapped Hornswoggle down to the mat . The match ended via disqualification , after Finlay , Hornswoggle original caretaker , entered the ring and hit Khali in the head with his own shillelagh . = = = Main event matches = = = The sixth match was Raw 's main match , in which Randy Orton faced Shawn Michaels for Orton 's WWE Championship . In this stipulated match , Michaels was banned from using his signature move , \" Sweet Chin Music \" , while Orton was unable to get disqualified , and if either man broke those stipulations he would have lost the WWE Championship match . Because Michaels was banned from using the superkick , his signature maneuver , Michaels attempted various submission moves , such as the Sharpshooter , Crossface , and ankle lock . Eventually , Michaels , attempted to perform his superkick , but to prevent himself from losing the match , he stopped , which then allowed Orton to hit an RKO . Successfully pinning Michaels , Orton retained his WWE Title . The main event from SmackDown was the event 's final match , in which World Heavyweight Champion Batista defended his title against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match . At one point , Batista hit the The Undertaker with a Batista Bomb through a table . Batista then attempted to pin The Undertaker but he only got a two count . The Undertaker then hit Batista with a Tombstone Piledriver . He pinned Batista but Batista kicked out at two . The Undertaker then hit another Tombstone Piledriver on top of the steel ring steps . The Undertaker pinned Batista , and as the referee counted the pin , Edge , dressed as a cameraman , pulled the referee out of the ring , and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker 's head on top of the steel steps . Edge then slammed a folding chair across the back of The Undertaker 's head . While the referee re-entered the ring , Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker , and as a result , Batista pinned The Undertaker and retained his World Heavyweight Title . After the match Edge came back into the ring and struck The Undertaker in the head as he was sitting up . = = Aftermath = = After Survivor Series , Randy Orton was scripted into a feud with Chris Jericho , who made his return to WWE after a two-year hiatus . The following night on Raw , the evolving feud culminated into a match being promoted for Armageddon , WWE 's December pay-per-view . At Armageddon , Orton retained his WWE Title . After Batista retained his World Heavyweight Championship , Edge was scripted into a rivalry with him over his title . Eventually , The Undertaker was also placed in feud , which led to the advertising of a Triple Threat match at Armageddon for the title . At Armageddon , Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship . Due to the events that occurred at Survivor Series , a match was announced between Finlay and The Great Khali for Armageddon . Finlay prevailed at Armageddon via pinning The Great Khali . After surviving their Elimination tag team match , Triple H and Jeff Hardy were promoted into a match for Armageddon , in which the winner would win the opportunity to challenge for the WWE Championship . At Armageddon , Hardy defeated Triple H. Because Beth Phoenix and Mickie James were the leaders of their teams at Survivor Series , a feud evolved from this , which culminated into a match at Armageddon over Phoenix 's WWE Women 's Championship . Phoenix retained her title at Armageddon . = = = Reception = = = The American Airlines Arena usually has a capacity of 19,600 , which was reduced for Survivor Series due to production purposes . From an approximate attendance of 12,000 and 341,000 pay-per-view buys , Survivor Series helped WWE earn $ 19.9 million in pay-per-view revenue versus $ 18.7 million the previous year ; this was confirmed by WWE in its 2007 fourth quarter financial report . Although Survivor Series helped WWE 's revenue , it earned 42,000 less buys than the previous year 's Survivor Series . In addition , the pay-per-view received mixed reviews . Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk of Canadian Online Explorer 's SLAM ! Sports \u2013 Wrestling rated the entire event 7.5 out of 10 points .

                    "text": "SummerSlam ( 1992 ) = SummerSlam ( 1992 ) was the fifth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . It took place on August 29 , 1992 , at Wembley Stadium , London , England but was aired in the United States on August 31 . The buildup to the pay-per-view consisted of feuds scripted by the WWF 's writers . To date it is the only major WWF pay-per-view to take place outside North America . The pay-per-view featured two main-event matches . In the first , The Ultimate Warrior challenged Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . The Warrior won the match by countout but did not win the title . In the other main event , The \" British Bulldog \" Davey Boy Smith pinned Bret Hart to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship . The WWF Tag Team Championship was also defended , as The Natural Disasters retained the championship belts in their match against the Beverly Brothers . One of the heavily promoted matches on the undercard was between Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel . The match , which had a special stipulation that the wrestlers could not hit each other in the face , ended in a double countout . The WWE considers the crowd to be the fourth largest live audience ever to attend a WWF / E event , with 80,355 in attendance ; WrestleMania 29 in 2013 is reported as having 80,676 fans in attendance , WrestleMania III in 1987 is reported as having 93,173 fans in attendance and WrestleMania 32 in 2016 is reported as having 101,763 fans in attendance . Some writers believe that the WWF inflated the attendance figure for WrestleMania III , however , and that SummerSlam 1992 had a larger crowd . Between ticket prices and merchandise sales , the WWF made over $ 3,650,000 in revenue . Reviews of the event are almost all positive , and the Smith-Hart match has been rated the best match in SummerSlam history . = = Background = = SummerSlam 1992 was originally intended to take place in Washington , D.C .. The WWF decided to move the event to Wembley Stadium in London , England due to the company 's growing popularity and the possibility of increasing the revenue from the event . Although the writers ' plans originally called for Shawn Michaels to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart , the storyline was adjusted due to the change of venue . As a result , \" The British Bulldog \" Davey Boy Smith , a native of Wigan , a working-class town in the north of England , was chosen to win the belt . Accordingly , one of the main events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith , brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart , Bret 's sister . On television broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam , interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match . Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith , while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret . Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match , as she had close ties to both men . She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt . Prior to the match , Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee , which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester , Massachusetts ( the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary ) ; despite the concerns about his health , he decided to wrestle the match as planned . Bret Hart later revealed in an interview that he doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out what they were going to do at Wembley , and when they finally got to the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours . However , Hart also stated that as bad as Smith 's personal issues were , he \" sucked it up \" and hit every spot in the match . The other main event was a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage . The storyline between them began in August 1990 , when Sensational Sherri , who was managing Savage , tried to arrange a match between Savage and the Warrior at SummerSlam 1990 . The Warrior refused to defend his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Savage , and he ripped up a contract that Sherri had given him . Later that month , he ripped Sherri 's dress off after a match against Savage . They faced each other at house shows over the next six months , but Savage was unable to win the title . Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991 , enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title . To settle the rivalry , Savage and the Warrior agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII . The Warrior won the match , but Savage 's former valet Miss Elizabeth reunited with Savage after the match . Savage continued to wrestle for the WWF , but the feud with the Ultimate Warrior did not continue . The following year , the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate Warrior was granted a shot at the WWF World Heavyweight Championship , which Savage had won from Ric Flair at WrestleMania VIII on April 5 , 1992 . Flair and his manager , Mr. Perfect , were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch . They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the Warrior , and Perfect announced on August 8 , 1992 that he was negotiating with Savage , his former rival , to appear in his corner during the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at SummerSlam . The following week , Perfect claimed that the Ultimate Warrior had also been seeking his services . Perfect announced his intention to appear in one man 's corner but would not clarify which one . At the SummerSlam Spectacular , a show designed to promote the pay-per-view , Savage and the Warrior teamed up to face The Nasty Boys . Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match , but Savage and the Warrior chased them back to the locker room after the match . Two tag team matches were also featured on the undercard . Money Inc . ( Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster ) and the The Legion of Doom ( Hawk and Animal ) were feuding in 1992 over the WWF Tag Team Championship . The Legion of Doom held the championship belts until Hawk failed a drug test . As a result , the WWF suspended him and had the Legion of Doom drop the belts to Money Inc . Once Hawk 's suspension ended , a rematch was scheduled to take place at SummerSlam . The match was first announced as a title match but Money Inc. lost the championship to The Natural Disasters , transferring the title match status to another match . Meanwhile , the Natural Disasters ( Earthquake and Typhoon ) and the Beverly Brothers ( Beau and Blake ) had a rivalry dating back to a WWF television taping on June 30 , 1992 . Typhoon attacked The Genius , who managed the Beverlys , while Earthquake brawled with both of the Beverlys . The match aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling on July 20 ; the same day that it aired , the Disasters won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Money Inc . As a result of this win , the title was on the line in the match at SummerSlam . In addition to the title defenses , the event also featured a match between Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel . Their rivalry focused on Martel 's attempts to steal Michaels ' valet Sensational Sherri . During one of Michaels ' matches televised on August 9 , 1992 , Martel came to ringside and winked at Sherri , who returned the gesture . At the SummerSlam Spectacular , Sherri came to the ring during one of Martel 's matches and winked at him . Both Michaels and Martel were \" heel \" wrestlers who bragged about their good looks , and Sherri had them agree not to hit each other in the face during their SummerSlam match . = = Event = = = = = Preliminary Matches = = = Before the pay-per-view broadcast began , two matches were taped for later showings on WWF Prime Time Wrestling . These matches were never advertised on US television in the weeks leading up to SummerSlam . Vince McMahon , on commentary during these bouts , referred to them as ' Bonus Matches ' . The first match saw \" Hacksaw \" Jim Duggan and The Bushwhackers ( Luke Williams and Butch ) defeat The Mountie and The Nasty Boys ( Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags ) when Duggan pinned The Mountie . In the other match , Papa Shango defeated Tito Santana by pinfall . In the opening match of the actual PPV telecast , the Legion of Doom ( Hawk and Animal ) faced Money Inc . ( Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster ) . The Legion of Doom used their size and power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match . Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline . Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept him away from the corner where Animal was standing . Eventually , Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time . Hawk tagged Animal in , and the Legion of Doom attempted to perform the Doomsday device , their signature move . Schyster stopped them , but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation , causing Schyster to run into DiBiase . Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory . The second match of the broadcast featured Nailz competing against Virgil . Nailz spent the majority of the match choking Virgil . Virgil recovered several times and performed several offensive maneuvers , but Nailz always regained the advantage . Ultimately , Nailz won the match by performing a sleeper hold . After the match , he attacked Virgil with a nightstick . In the following match , competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable , due to a pre-match stipulation , to hit each other in the face . The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri . Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there . When the two returned to the ring , they took turns attempting to pin their opponent , pulling down their opponent 's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time . Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him , but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels ' feet were on the ropes . Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face . Sherri pretended to faint , which drew the attention of both wrestlers . Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage , with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent . Both wrestlers were counted out , but they continued to argue . Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her , but he hit Michaels as well . Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage ; upset at being left behind by both men , Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage . The tag team championship match came next , which saw the Beverly Brothers ( Beau and Blake ) attack the Natural Disasters ( Earthquake and Typhoon ) before the bell . The Disasters used their size and strength to gain the advantage , but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon . The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes , with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock . Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents but was unable to tag in Earthquake . Later , Typhoon attempted to make the tag again , but Beau distracted Earthquake ; while the referee 's back was turned , The Beverlys ' manager , The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll , which Blake used to hit Typhoon . Typhoon recovered , however , and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match . He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash . The following match , which was not shown on the telecast in the United Kingdom , pitted Crush against the Repo Man . Crush used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man . Repo Man performed a back suplex , but Crush showed no sign that the move affected him . Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex . Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope , but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission . = = = Main Event Matches = = = One of the two main event matches came next , as Randy Savage defended The WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior . Although Mr. Perfect had claimed that he would be in the corner of one of the competitors , he did not come to ringside for the beginning of the match . Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth , with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops . Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope , but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time . After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring , Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle . Once the wrestlers got back into the ring , Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside . The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage , who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver . The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner . As a result of the ref bump , Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop . Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior , only to attack him when he stood up . The Warrior recovered and attempted to execute a running splash , but Flair hit him with a chair . Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man . In retaliation , Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair , but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair . Savage was unable to get back into the ring , so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout . Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away . Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together . The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was followed by a bout pitting Tatanka defeating The Berzerker by pinfall . This match was originally announced on US television , in the weeks leading up to SummerSlam , as being part of the PPV telecast . Due to time constraints it was cut from the PPV lineup in post-production . The match , however , later aired on WWF Prime Time Wrestling . The next match was between the Undertaker and Kamala . Kamala , who was accompanied by his manager , Harvey Wippleman , and his handler , Kim Chee , attacked the Undertaker before the match . The Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent . The Undertaker attempted the same move again , but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope . Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring , where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee . Back inside the ring , the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline . When the Undertaker attempted to perform his signature move , the Tombstone Piledriver , Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet . As a result , Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match . Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker with a series of splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious . When the Undertaker suddenly sat up and looked directly at the Ugandan Giant , Kamala , Whippleman and Kim Chee panicked and fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit . Up next , Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes . The event concluded with the second main event , a contest for the Intercontinental Championship between champion Bret Hart and challenger \" British Bulldog \" Davey Boy Smith , who was accompanied by the reigning Commonwealth Heavyweight Boxing Champion , London native Lennox Lewis . In the opening minutes , Hart used his technical wrestling abilities and Smith relied on his power advantage . Hart got control of the match with a reverse atomic drop and a Samoan drop . Smith came back with a monkey flip , but Hart regained the advantage with a bulldog and a plancha . Smith eventually recovered and tried to pin Hart with a back slide . Hart escaped the pin attempt and wore Smith down with sleeper holds . Smith gained the advantage , however , and used power moves to control the match , including a powerslam and a variety of suplexes . Hart managed to place Smith in the Sharpshooter , Hart 's signature submission hold . Smith escaped the hold , however , and threw Hart against the ropes . While running back at Smith , Hart attempted a sunset flip . Smith countered the move and pinned Hart to win the Intercontinental Championship . Immediately after the match , Hart refused to shake Smith 's hand . He soon changed his mind , however , and hugged Smith as well as Diana Hart , who was celebrating with her husband . = = Aftermath = = Randy Savage , who continued to sell his supposedly injured leg , lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1 , 1992 in Hershey , Pennsylvania . During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon , igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon . Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand , and that he was angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon . McMahon was that angry that he actually made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match . After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior , McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration . After plans by WWF writers to turn the Ultimate Warrior against Savage were scrapped due to the Warrior 's refusal to turn heel , the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992 . However , as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21 , his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect , who accepted it in spite of Flair , thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993 . Shawn Michaels , who had originally been booked to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart at SummerSlam , won the title from Davey Boy Smith on October 27 ( the match would air on the November 14 , 1992 , episode of Saturday Night 's Main Event ) . Michaels and Sherri continued their on-screen relationship after SummerSlam . Sherri claimed to have created the rivalry with Martel to test Michaels ' love for her . Their relationship deteriorated , though when Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to protect himself from an attack by his former tag team partner , Marty Jannetty on the October 31 episode of WWF Superstars . This led to confrontations between Sherri and Michaels at Royal Rumble 1993 and WrestleMania IX . The Undertaker continued to feud with Kamala and Harvey Wippleman . The two wrestlers faced each other again at Survivor Series 1992 in a coffin match , which the Undertaker won . Wippleman gained revenge by introducing Giant Gonzalez ( and later Mr. Hughes ) , with whom the Undertaker feuded through 1993 . Upset about the amount of his pay for appearing at SummerSlam , Kevin Wacholz ( Nailz ) confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon after Survivor Series 1992 . According to reports , he legitimately attacked McMahon . As a result , Nailz was fired from the WWF . He briefly appeared in rival promotion World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) as the Prisoner but was released after the WWF sued WCW because of The Prisoner 's similarity to the Nailz character . The anger between Wacholz and McMahon spilled over into McMahon 's 1994 trial , in which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers . Although Wacholz testified against McMahon , his statements , which included , \" I hate Vince McMahon 's guts \" ultimately proved harmful to the prosecution 's case . = = = Reception = = = According to the WWF , the 80,355 people in attendance for SummerSlam 1992 is the fourth largest in the company 's history , behind only WrestleMania 29 , WrestleMania III and WrestleMania 32 , which is said to have attracted 101,763 fans . The event has received positive reviews from a variety of sources . RD Reynolds has called it \" a huge success \" . In particular , the Intercontinental Championship match has been called \" one of the greatest matches of all time \" . Pro Wrestling Illustrated named it the Match of the Year in the magazine 's year-end issue , and WWE has called the match the greatest moment in SummerSlam history . Bret Hart has also named it as his favorite match of all time . The WWF collected $ 2,200,000 in revenue from admissions , up from $ 445,000 the previous year . The company also sold $ 1,456,203 in merchandise at SummerSlam , which is the largest amount of merchandise revenue at a WWF event . The buyrate for the event was 1.5 , down from 2.7 at SummerSlam 1991 but higher than the 1.3 buyrate at SummerSlam 1993 . SummerSlam 1992 was released on VHS format on September 24 , 1992 . While the US release only included the 8 matches that were shown on the PPV telecast , the UK release included all 11 matches including the three dark matches . On October 3 , 2005 in the United Kingdom , the event was released on DVD , packaged together with SummerSlam 1993 , as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line . The event was again later released as part of WWE 's SummerSlam Anthology boxed DVD set . The anthology was released on August 5 , 2008 in North America and was released on October 6 , 2008 in the United Kingdom . However , the version that is included with the Anthology is only the 8 match PPV broadcast version . = = Results = =",

It took place on November 27 , 2005 , at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit , Michigan and consisted of six professional wrestling matches involving wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands . In the first of two main event matches , WWE Champion John Cena defeated Kurt Angle to retain his title . The second main event was an interpromotional 5-on-5 Survivor Series match , in which Team SmackDown ( Batista , Rey Mysterio , John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield ( JBL ) , Bobby Lashley , and Randy Orton ) defeated Team Raw ( Shawn Michaels , Kane , The Big Show , Carlito , and Chris Masters ) after Orton last eliminated Michaels . In another match , Triple H defeated Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match . = = Background = = The event 's card consisted of six professional wrestling involving wrestlers from either Raw or SmackDown , WWE 's two brand divisions . The main leading rivalry leading into the event was between the Raw and SmackDown brands as a whole , rather than individual wrestlers . The rivalry began on \" WWE Homecoming , a special episode of Raw on October 3 when Raw 's general manager Eric Bischoff stopped a match involving SmackDown wrestlers by turning the lights off . In return , Bischoff 's SmackDown counterpart , Theodore Long , interrupted a Raw match . As a result , wrestlers from the two brands started a brawl and interfered in the other 's show before facing each other in a tag team match at Taboo Tuesday ; SmackDown 's Rey Mysterio , Jr. and Matt Hardy defeated Raw 's Chris Masters and Gene Snitsky . After Taboo Tuesday , Bischoff and Long agreed that teams from each brand would face each other in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series match , while the two managers would wrestle in a singles match at Survivor Series . The teams feuded on both shows , and Batista , the captain of the SmackDown team , suffered an injury after being attacked several times . Eddie Guerrero was originally scheduled to be on Team SmackDown , but due to his death on November 13 , 2005 , he was replaced by Randy Orton . Another rivalry heading into the event was between John Cena and Kurt Angle , over the WWE Championship . Their feud began in August , when Bischoff chose Angle as the number one contender to the WWE Championship . Angle failed to win the title at Unforgiven , due to Cena being disqualified . The two squared off against each other again at Taboo Tuesday in a Triple Threat match that also included Shawn Michaels , and again Cena retained the title . On the November 7 edition of Raw , Angle refused to compete in a tag team match pitting him and Chris Masters against Cena and Michaels due to the \" you suck \" chants from the audience . Angle finally agreed to compete if Bischoff silenced the crowd and let him have a special guest referee . Angle chose Daivari , who favoured Angle and Masters throughout the match and ultimately disqualified Cena and Michaels for using a chair , which he had ignored earlier when it had been used by Masters . The rivalry between Triple H and Ric Flair began at WWE Homecoming , when Triple H returned to WWE television after an absence of three months . The two had been aligned since 2002 , as members of Evolution , and were partners in a tag team match on the show . After they won the match , Triple H attacked Flair with a sledgehammer . The week after , Triple H explained his actions , saying that he realized Flair was no longer the legend he was , and he needed to stop Flair . Flair and Triple H met in a steel cage match at Taboo Tuesday , which Flair won . A Last Man Standing match was made between the two for Survivor Series . = = Event = = Before the event aired live on pay-per-view , a match was contested on Sunday Night Heat between Juventud ( accompanied by Super Crazy and Psicosis ) defeated Simon Dean . In the first pay-per-view match , Booker T ( accompanied by Sharmell ) faced off against Chris Benoit in the first match of their \" Best of 7 series \" for the vacant WWE United States Championship . The match started with Booker T exiting the ring when Benoit gained a slight advantage . The match went back and forth for the first half before Booker T took control . The match saw interference by Sharmell , as she distracted Benoit , who was on the top ropes . After Benoit missed a free fall headbutt , Booker T won the match with a pin using the ropes for leverage . Booker T took a 1 \u2013 0 lead in the series . In the following match Trish Stratus ( accompanied by Mickie James ) defended her WWE Women 's Championship against Melina ( accompanied by Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro . Stratus immediately took control until Melina fought back . When Nitro and Mercury interfered , the referee ejected them from ringside . Melina kept control until Stratus fought back with forearm shots . Stratus pinned Melina after a diving bulldog to retain the title . Next , Triple H met Ric Flair in a Last Man Standing match . Flair was still on his way to the ring , when Triple H attacked him and gained the early advantage . After attacking Flair 's head with a screwdriver , Triple H continued using foreign objects throughout the match , including a folding chair , a sledgehammer , and the steel ring steps . The match went back and forth between Triple H and Flair . Triple H attempted to hit Flair with a Pedigree on the announce table , but Flair countered the move into a back body drop through another announce table . Triple H later performed the Pedigree three times on Flair , but Flair got up each time . Triple H then hit Flair in the back with a sledgehammer , and Flair did not get to his feet before the referee 's ten count , giving Triple H the win . After the match , Edge and Lita came into the ring , and Edge announced that he would be hosting a new show on Raw entitled \" The Cutting Edge \" . Edge noted that Dmitri Young was in the audience , and proceeded to criticize the sports teams of Detroit . Young replied by insulting Edge and his lack of a world championship . The fourth match saw John Cena defending the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle , with Daivari as the special guest referee . Early in the match , Angle was able to apply the Ankle lock on Cena . Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off . An angered Cena slapped Daivari , who tried to disqualify him as a result . Angle , however , stopped him , and both men were knocked out of the ring by Cena . As Daivari was knocked down outside , a Raw referee came out to officiate . After Cena gained the advantage , Angle knocked down the referee , and executed an illegal low blow . Angle called for another referee , but failed to get the win after executing an Olympic Slam and a superplex . After Angle missed a moonsault attempt , Cena went for an FU ; however , Angle countered by holding onto the referee , which led to Angle knocking down the referee . As the other referee was knocked out , a SmackDown referee came out . Cena then hit a DDT on Daivari and executed an FU on Angle , pinning him to retain the title . In the fifth match , the authority figures from both brands faced each other with two referees from each show officiating the match . Theodore Long , who was accompanied by Palmer Canon , started the match by avoiding Eric Bischoff 's attacks . As Cannon climbed on the apron , and distracted the referees , Bischoff used his obi to choke Long . Bischoff continued to choke Long and applied the sleeper hold . Cannon distracted the referees again as Long hit Bischoff with his shoe . Bischoff then hit Long with a chop to the throat . The Boogeyman 's music played with Bischoff sending the referees up the ramp to stop him . The Boogeyman was behind Bischoff , however , and he hit Bischoff with a pumphandle slam on Bischoff . Long took advantage and pinned Bischoff to win the match . The final match was the Survivor Series match between Team SmackDown ( Batista , Rey Mysterio , John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield , Bobby Lashley and Randy Orton ) and Team Raw ( Shawn Michaels , Kane , The Big Show , Carlito and Chris Masters ) . At first , the two teams alternated in taking control . The first wrestler to be eliminated was Lashley , who was chokeslammed by Kane and pinned by Michaels . Kane was then eliminated by Batista after a 619 from Mysterio and a spinebuster from Batista . After that , Batista was eliminated after a double chokeslam by Big Show and Kane . Big Show was eliminated next after a Clothesline From Hell by JBL , a 619 from Mysterio , an RKO by Orton , another Clothesline by JBL and a seated senton by Mysterio . Mysterio then pinned him for the elimination . Carlito was then eliminated , after JBL performed a Clothesline From Hell . Next , Mysterio hit a Springboard Legdrop on Masters for the elimination . Michaels went on to eliminate both Mysterio and JBL , after a superkick . Orton and Michaels were the final two men left from their respective teams . JBL then distracted Michaels , which made Michaels superkick JBL . As Michaels turned around , Orton executed an RKO on Michaels and pinned Michaels to win the match for Team SmackDown . Following the match , SmackDown wrestlers came to the ring to celebrate with Orton when hooded figures carrying a casket came out . At No Mercy ( 2005 ) Orton had defeated the Undertaker in a handicap-casket and set the casket on fire . Now , lightning struck the casket and set it on fire ; The Undertaker emerged and attacked several of the wrestlers while Orton and his father \" Cowboy \" Bob Orton evaded the Undertaker by leaving the ring . = = Aftermath = = The five-on-five Survivor Series match ended the rivalry between the brands . Eric Bischoff was fired as general manager of Raw by Vince McMahon , who took control of the Raw brand as temporary general manager of Raw . McMahon soon started to feud with Shawn Michaels , whom he lauded for his part in the Montreal Screwjob , when Michaels told McMahon to move on . After Survivor Series , John Cena and Kurt Angle continued their feud . Before being fired , Bischoff had proposed that Cena should defend his WWE championship in an Elimination Chamber match at New Year 's Revolution . On the December 12 episode of Raw , Kurt Angle , Carlito , Shawn Michaels , Chris Masters , and Kane won matches qualifying them for the Elimination Chamber match . After the qualifying matches , Cena faced Angle 's associate , Daivari in a \" You Can 't See Me \" match , as it would see Cena blindfolded during the match . Cena won as he made Daivari submit to the STFU . At New Year 's Revolution , Cena also won the Elimination Chamber match , last eliminating Carlito . Randy Orton and The Undertaker fought each other at Armageddon in a Hell in a Cell match , which the Undertaker won , ending their feud . Triple H moved on to feud with The Big Show , and Ric Flair feuded with Edge over the WWE Intercontinental Championship . Chris Benoit continued to feud with Booker T throughout the rest of the year and into 2006 ; their \" Best of Seven series \" concluded in January . Randy Orton , who was Booker 's replacement due to a kayfabe injury , defeated Benoit in the seventh and final match , giving Booker the WWE United States Championship . However , Booker would lose the title to Benoit the following month at No Way Out . = = Results = =",

TNA planned a thirty-minute pre-show prior to the event . The debut of newly signed wrestler Samoa Joe was announced heading into the show where he would be pitted in a bout against Sonjay Dutt . = = = Storylines = = = Slammiversary featured nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches . The main event at Slammiversary was a King of the Mountain match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in which the champion A.J. Styles defended the title against four other competitors . At TNA 's Lockdown PPV event on April 24 , Styles defeated Abyss in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match . With the victory , he earned a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against then-champion Jeff Jarrett at TNA 's Hard Justice PPV event on May 15 .

The choices were Falls Count Anywhere match , Tables match , or Full Metal Mayhem . = = = Storylines = = = Victory Road featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . The main event at Victory Road was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challenger Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA 's Slammiversary PPV event on June 8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title , which Joe won to remain champion . On the June 12 episode of TNA 's television program TNA Impact ! , Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe 's mentor Kevin Nash . This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match . After this segment , Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title . Since Houston is Booker T 's hometown , TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship for the people of Houston . On the July 10 episode of Impact ! , Sting proclaimed that he did not know which of the two would win at Victory Road , but that he would be there to watch . The predominate storyline heading into the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle , both members of The Angle Alliance . On the February 14 episode of Impact ! , TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle 's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen . Afterwards , Karen and Angle separated in the storyline on the March 13 episode of Impact ! . TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May 15 episode of Impact ! . Karen refused Angle 's request on the May 22 episode of Impact ! , leading to Angle turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles . This led to a match between the two at Slammiversary which Styles won after a distraction by Karen . The two faced in a Lumberjack match on the June 12 episode of Impact ! , which Angle won before it ended in a brawl between Styles , Angle , Tomko , Christian Cage , Rhino , Abyss , and Team 3D ( Brother Devon and Brother Ray ) .

The encounter was between Daivari of Team International , Kaz of Team TNA , Naruki Doi of Team Japan , and Volador Jr. of Team Mexico . In an Ultimate X match , two steel cables are attached to four steel supports in such a way that they form an \" X \" above the ring . At the center of this \" X \" an item is hung , which must be retrieved by a participant to win the match . In this bout , the item hanging above the ring was an enlarged red \" X \" which symbolized four points in the World X Cup . During the encounter , Kaz ascended one of the steel supports before jumping off towards the center of the ring and slamming his leg onto Daivari , who was holding onto the cables . This action forced both of them to fall and crash onto the ring mat below . Afterwards , Volador Jr ascended the cables and retrieved the \" X \" to win the match and four points for Team Mexico at 10 minutes and 58 seconds . With this victory , Team Mexico won the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament with seven points , compared to six by Team TNA , and three by Team Japan and Team International , respectively .

Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment 's ( WWE ) The Great American Bash PPV event on July 20 , Victory Road fared better as The Great American Bash received a 6 out of 10 from Dave Hillhouse . Kapur discussed in his review how the main event of a show can impact the rest of the event . He stated that \" a confusing , overbooked fustercluck \" main event , such as the one at Victory Road , \" can leave a bad taste in your mouth after it \u2019 s over , even if everything else was pretty solid . \" He went on to say that based on the crowd reaction the \" finish seemed to dampen the enthusiasm of what was otherwise a really good show , \" and that it was \" unfortunate , because everything leading up to that point was good to great . \" Kapur gave the main event a 3 out of 10 , while the Full Metal Mayhem match and the World Tag Team Championship both received a 7 out of 10 .

He felt the main event had a \" good start to what might have been a decent match \" but stated that it was \" far from a satisfying finish \" for the price . Keller felt the Full Metal Mayhem bout was a \" clustermess of a match , \" but at the same time was \" entertaining start to finish . \" As for the World Tag Team Championship match , he said that it felt \" anticlimactic \" and that having the fans at ringside was more of a \" distraction \" than a \" payoff . \" Regarding the World X Cup , Keller said the third round bout was a dream match for some with \" lots of cool spots from start to finish , \" but that it had \" little context early \" and was more just a \" bunch of spots . \" He also said that the \" last ten minutes was better without as many people tagging in and out somewhat indiscriminately . \" As for the final round , Keller commented that \" it had some spectacular ( and ridiculously dangerous looking ) spots , \" but that it ended up \" feeling short for a match of that caliber . \" James Caldwell , also of the Pro Wrestling Torch Newsletter , reviewed the show live from the arena . He said the main event had a \" terrible terrible finish \" which \" killed the crowd . \" He also commented that it was one of the \" worst finishes \" he had \" ever seen . \" Caldwell stated that the Full Metal Mayhem match had \" lots of crazy spots \" and that A.J. Styles received a \" superstar pop coming out to the ring \" from the audience that \" carried on throughout the match \" . He felt the World Tag Team Championship match was an \" OK tag match . \" As for the World X Cup , Caldwell stated that the third round bout was \" entertaining yet quite long \" and that the \" crowd was super into Sabin and Shelley . \" He also said that after the match settled into \" one-on-one action \" it \" turned into a pretty good match . \" The final round was seen by Caldwell as \" one of those rinse and repeat spot fest matches until Kaz busted out the big double foot stomp on Daivari that popped the crowd . \" Overall , he called it a \" one spot match . \" = = Aftermath = = Brother Devon injured his ankle during the Full Metal Mayhem match , while Kaz injured his hip due to his jump during the Ultimate X match .

                    "text": "WrestleMania X = WrestleMania X was the tenth annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation . It took place at Madison Square Garden in New York , New York on March 20 , 1994 . The central focus of the pay-per-view was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship , which was defended in two matches . Lex Luger challenged champion Yokozuna first but was disqualified for pushing the referee . Bret Hart faced Yokozuna later in the evening and won the championship by pinning Yokozuna . This led to a lengthy worked feud between Bret and his brother Owen , who had defeated Bret in the opening match of the pay-per-view . Several other major feuds were also highlighted at this event . Razor Ramon defeated Shawn Michaels in a Ladder match to resolve an angle in which the two had argued over the rightful holder of the WWF Intercontinental Championship . Bam Bam Bigelow gained revenge against Doink the Clown , with whom he had been feuding , by teaming with Luna Vachon to defeat Doink and his partner Dink . Randy Savage also settled his feud with Crush by defeating him in a Falls Count Anywhere match . WrestleMania X was the first edition of the event not to feature Hulk Hogan , who had been seen as the public face of the WWF ; following Hogan 's 1993 departure , that role had shifted to Bret Hart . The card also marked Randy Savage 's last televised match for the company . This also mark the final play by play by Gorilla Monsoon at Wrestlemania as he called the action along with Chet Coppock on commentary for Radio WWF ( the last pay-per-view to be broadcast on radio ) = = Background = = The storyline surrounding the WWF World Heavyweight Championship began at the 1994 Royal Rumble when the final two wrestlers , Lex Luger and Bret Hart , simultaneously eliminated each other . After a disagreement between two referees , Jack Tunney , the WWF President , declared Luger and Hart co-winners . Tunney announced that both wrestlers would get a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania , the prize given to the winner of the Royal Rumble match , and both wrestlers would have to wrestle two matches for the pay-per-view . Tunney announced that a coin toss would be used to decide who faced Yokozuna for the belt first . If Luger won , he would face Yokozuna first . Hart would then wrestle his brother Owen Hart before facing the winner of the Luger-Yokozuna match . If Hart won the coin toss , he would get the first title shot , and Luger would wrestle Crush earlier on the card . On the January 31 , 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw , Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first . Bret Hart was booked to face his brother Owen , with whom he was in the middle of a feud . The storyline between the Hart brothers began at Survivor Series 1993 , where they were competing on the same side of an elimination match . As Owen was fighting in the ring , Bret , who had sustained a kayfabe injury , was staggering along the ring apron . Owen ran into Bret , causing Owen to lose his focus and get eliminated from the match . After the match , Owen returned to the ring and had a confrontation with Bret . In the following weeks , Owen demanded a match with Bret , but Bret refused to accept the challenge . Eventually , the storyline had the brothers reunite to face The Quebecers at Royal Rumble 1994 . During the match , Bret sustained another kayfabe injury , causing the referee to end the match . In a planned turn , Owen got upset by the loss and attacked Bret to restart the feud . Luger 's feud with Yokozuna began on July 4 , 1993 , at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge . In June , Mr. Fuji , Yokozuna 's manager , challenged all American athletes to attempt to bodyslam Yokozuna on the deck of the USS Intrepid . After several athletes failed , the storyline saw Luger arrive by helicopter and successfully bodyslam Yokozuna . This began a strong push for Luger , who was then scheduled to challenge Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993 . Luger won the match by countout but did not win the title . The WWF claimed that the match stipulations did not allow Luger a rematch . The storyline saw Luger campaigning for entry into the 1994 Royal Rumble , as he wanted the title shot that would be given to the winner . Luger was eventually entered into the match , although The Great Kabuki and Genichiro Tenryu were also entered , on Mr. Fuji 's behalf , to attempt to prevent Luger from winning . Kabuki and Tenryu were unsuccessful , however , as Luger won the match and gained a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . The storyline leading to the match between \" Macho Man \" Randy Savage and Crush focused on the supposedly strained friendship between the two wrestlers . On the July 12 , 1993 , episode of Monday Night Raw , Crush challenged Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship . At the end of the match , Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop to win the match . After the match , he performed three more Banzai Drops while various wrestlers ran to the ring to stop the attack . Savage eventually came to the ring to help Crush . Following the match , Crush was not seen on televised matches for several months , although he continued to appear at house shows . On October 18 , Crush appeared on Monday Night Raw accompanied by Yokozuna and Yokozuna 's manager , Mr. Fuji . Crush criticized Savage for not intervening sooner during the July 12 match . In a worked promo , Crush announced that he had turned against Savage and the United States in order to align himself with Yokozuna and Fuji . He then attacked Savage by dropping him on the ringside guard rail . Yokozuna performed the Banzai Drop on Savage before a group of referees came to the ring to break up the fight . During the November 8 , 1993 episode of Monday Night Raw , Savage left his position as commentator to attack Crush . The following week , Jack Tunney announced that Savage was suspended from commentating as a result of the previous week 's attack . The feud intensified at Survivor Series 1993 when Savage and Crush caused each other to be eliminated from their respective matches . Bam Bam Bigelow and Doink the Clown were engaged in a feud that began in the fall of 1993 . Doink annoyed Bigelow with a series of pranks , such as throwing water and confetti on him and tripping him with a broom . Bigelow retaliated against Doink and Doink 's midget sidekick Dink . A match was booked for Survivor Series 1993 , but Bigelow was unable to get revenge because Doink did not compete . Instead , the WWF prolonged the feud by having Bigelow 's team face was The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission dressed as Doinks . The feud eventually culminated in a match scheduled for WrestleMania X. In the match , Bigelow and his storyline girlfriend Luna Vachon competed against Doink and Dink in a Mixed tag team match . The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to the fall of 1993 . Jack Tunney announced that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough . There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt . Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel , the other finalist in the match . In the angle , Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change , however , as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion . To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt , Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon 's gold chains . = = Event = = In a dark match before the pay-per-view aired , The Heavenly Bodies faced The Bushwhackers . Near the end of the match , The Bushwhackers gained control when they performed the Battering Ram on Jimmy Del Ray . Tom Prichard , Del Ray 's partner , attacked Bushwhacker Butch before he was able to pin Del Ray . This allowed Del Ray to recover and pin Butch to win the match . As the broadcast began , Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler were introduced as commentators for the event and Little Richard sang \" America the Beautiful \" . The first televised match was between Bret and Owen Hart . The beginning of the match went back and forth with neither wrestler gaining a strong advantage . The tension between the two was demonstrated by Owen 's bragging and Bret 's refusal to let Owen leave the ring . Owen eventually gained momentum by using a camel clutch on Bret and performing suplexes and a Tombstone piledriver . When Owen stood outside the ring to recuperate , Bret jumped over the top rope to attack him . Bret landed awkwardly , however , and suffered a kayfabe injury to his knee . Owen used a figure four leglock to capitalize on Bret 's sore leg . Bret was able to recover , and he kicked Owen in the back of the head and used a Bulldog and sleeper hold to weaken Owen . Owen regained the advantage , however , and applied the Sharpshooter on Bret . Bret was able to escape and perform a Sharpshooter on Owen . Bret then attempted to end the match with a victory roll , but Owen blocked it and pinned Bret to win the match . Sy Sperling , the president of hair restoration company Hair Club for Men , appeared in the ring before the next match . He announced that he was at WrestleMania to introduce one of his latest clients , ring announcer Howard Finkel . Finkel came to the ring wearing a toup\u00e9e , showing off his new hair while the crowd applauded . The match then began , as Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon came to the ring to face Doink the Clown and Dink . Bigelow attacked Doink at the beginning of the match with a dropkick and a powerslam . When Dink entered the match , the rules stated that Bigelow had to tag Vachon into the match . Dink ran around the ring avoiding Vachon , but she eventually caught him . She kicked him and powerslammed him , but she then missed a moonsault attempt . Doink and Bigelow re-entered the match , and Doink performed a DDT on Bigelow . Bigelow reversed the momentum to win the match after a diving headbutt on Doink . Bigelow pinned Doink to win the match , and he and Vachon then attacked Dink . The next match was a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush . The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned , he then had to make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match . Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang , but Crush reversed the attack . He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall . While Savage was returning to the ring , Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him . Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining , so the match continued . Inside the ring , Crush tried to throw salt in Savage 's eyes , but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush 's eyes . Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall . Fuji helped revive Crush , which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired . Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage . Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush 's legs to a pulley . Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring , so Savage was declared the winner . Alundra Blayze defended her WWF Women 's Championship against Leilani Kai in the next match . Blayze began the match by using a leg sweep and two sunset flips . Kai came back with a powerslam and a suplex . Blayze got the win , however , by pinning Kai after performing a German suplex . In the next match , Men on a Mission challenged The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship . Although The Quebecers attacked Men on a Mission before the bell , Mabel quickly recovered and clotheslined both Quebecers . The Quebecers used several double-team moves against their opponents , but Mabel reversed the momentum after Pierre missed a senton bomb . Mabel eventually missed an Avalanche , allowing The Quebecers to suplex him . The Quebecers performed an assisted senton on Mabel but did not get a pinfall . Men on a Mission regained the advantage , prompting The Quebecers ' manager , Johnny Polo , to pull his wrestlers out of the ring . Men on a Mission won the match by countout , but they did not win the belts . The first WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next , as Lex Luger challenged Yokozuna . Mr. Perfect was revealed to be the special guest referee for the match , while Donnie Wahlberg was the guest ring announcer and Rhonda Shear was the guest timekeeper . After a verbal confrontation between Luger and Yokozuna , Luger gained the early advantage by knocking Yokozuna out of the ring . After getting back into the ring , Yokozuna removed the turnbuckle padding from a corner of the ring . Yokozuna used a nerve hold and a belly to belly suplex to wear down Luger . As he tried to throw Luger 's head into the exposed turnbuckle , however , Luger blocked him and hit Yokozuna 's head into the turnbuckle . Luger then performed clotheslines and a powerslam on Yokozuna before knocking Yokozuna kayfabe unconscious with a running forearm smash . Yokozuna 's managers , Mr. Fuji and Jim Cornette jumped onto the ring apron to distract Luger , and Luger pulled them into the ring and attacked them . Luger covered Yokozuna , but Mr. Perfect was tending to the fallen managers and did not make the count . When Luger pushed him , Mr. Perfect disqualified Luger and left the ring , thereby turning heel . Adam Bomb and his manager Harvey Wippleman entered the ring for the next match , and Wippleman criticized Finkel 's new hair and tore the pocket off Finkel 's suit . Earthquake came to the ring and attacked Bomb from behind . He powerslammed Bomb and performed the Earthquake splash to get the pinfall victory in thirty-five seconds . For the Ladder match , the Intercontinental belts belonging to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring , and the first wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner . Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels . Michaels recovered , however , and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon . Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside , where Michaels ' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon . Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel to return to the dressing rooms . Ramon pulled up the padding from the concrete floor , but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon 's attempt to perform the Razor 's Edge . While Ramon was lying on the floor , Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach , chest and back . Michaels tried to retrieve the belts , but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder . Michaels then set the ladder up in the corner of the ring and performed a splash onto Ramon . Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder . He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts . Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts . Michaels dropkicked the ladder , which caused Ramon to fall off . Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring . Michaels climbed the turnbuckles , jumped onto the ladder , and used his weight to push it down across Ramon 's chest . Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again , but Ramon pushed him off . Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up , allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship . A ten-man tag team match was supposed to take place next , but it was canceled due to time constraints . The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team ( Irwin R. Schyster , The Headshrinkers , Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett ) could not agree on who would be the team 's captain for the match . Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid , Sparky Plugg , Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns . Bob Holly ( \" Sparky Plugg \" ) , stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match , but Michaels and Ramon ignored him , and kept wrestling until officials were forced to cancel the tag team match . The final match of the night and main event was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Yokozuna and Bret Hart . The guest referee for the match was \" Rowdy \" Roddy Piper , while the guest ring announcer was Burt Reynolds and the guest timekeeper was Jennie Garth . Yokozuna attacked Hart before the bell , and Hart attempted a couple of comebacks in vain . Eventually , Yokozuna made a mistake and allowed Hart to knock him to the mat . Cornette tried to distract Piper , but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron . Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt . Bret maintained the advantage for a little while , but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex . When Yokozuna attempted the Banzai drop , however , he lost his balance and fell to the mat . Hart quickly pinned Yokozuna to win the title . He celebrated in the ring with several of the face wrestlers including Lex Luger , \" Rowdy \" Roddy Piper , Razor Ramon , Tatanka , The 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid , Sparky Plugg and \" Macho Man \" Randy Savage . Others who joined in the celebration included Burt Reynolds , Rhonda Shear , Donnie Wahlberg , and WWF commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon . Owen Hart stood in the aisle , glaring at Bret , then quickly left . = = Aftermath = = Men on a Mission continued to challenge The Quebecers for the tag team belts . Men on a Mission won the title on March 29 , 1994 . This is said to have been an unplanned title change , as Mabel accidentally fell on Pierre to get the pinfall . This title reign lasted only two days , however , as The Quebecers won the titles back in a rematch . Lex Luger and Mr. Perfect were scheduled to face each other in a series of matches on the WrestleMania Revenge Tour . Mr. Perfect was replaced by Crush , however , and Mr. Perfect did not appear again in the WWF until Survivor Series 1995 . Adam Bomb and Earthquake had a rematch on the April 4 , 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw , which Earthquake won . The feud did not progress any further , as Earthquake left the WWF for World Championship Wrestling in May 1994 . Wippleman and Finkel wrestled a series of Tuxedo matches in 1994 that culminated in a match on the January 9 , 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw . Finkel defeated Wippleman in a final Tuxedo match to end the feud . A few weeks after the match between Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon , Diesel begin to challenge Ramon for the Intercontinental championship . Michaels helped Diesel defeat Ramon for the title on April 13 , 1994 . This win began a push for Diesel that saw him win the WWF 's Triple Crown Championship in one calendar year . The ten-man tag team match took place on the April 4 , 1994 edition of Monday Night Raw . The heel team won , as Irwin R. Schyster pinned the 1 \u2013 2 \u2013 3 Kid to win the match . Bret and Owen Hart continued their feud throughout 1994 . At King of the Ring , their real-life brother-in-law and Bret 's former tag team partner Jim Neidhart became involved in the angle by helping Owen win the tournament . During the coronation ceremony , Owen announced that he wanted to be referred to as the \" King of Harts \" . At SummerSlam , Bret successfully defended his title against Owen in a Steel cage match but was attacked after the match by Owen and Neidhart , prompting another brother-in-law , Davey Boy Smith , to get involved on Bret 's side . At Survivor Series , the storyline saw Owen partially responsible for costing Bret the WWF Championship . Bret faced Bob Backlund in a match with the stipulation that the winner would be declared when a competitor 's cornerman threw a towel into the ring to signify a submission . After Owen caused Smith to knock himself unconscious , Owen pretended to feel sympathy for Bret . While Backlund had Bret in a crossface Chickenwing , the angle had Owen convince his mother Helen to throw in Bret 's towel , enabling Backlund to win the match and the title . After the match , Owen celebrated with Backlund and showed that he was faking the concern for his brother . = = = Reception = = = The event was attended by 18,065 people , who paid a total of $ 960,000 in admission fees .

Mercury and Nitro first began teaming together in 2004 in OVW , WWE 's developmental territory in Louisville , Kentucky . Melina , who at the time was Nitro 's actual girlfriend , joined them as their manager in February 2005 . While working in OVW , Mercury and Nitro captured the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on one occasion . MNM were called up to the SmackDown ! roster in April 2005 , in which Mercury and Nitro went on to win the WWE Tag Team Championship . While in WWE , their ring personas was that of a trio of Hollywood celebrities , complete with a red carpet ring entrance , that had them accompanied by \" paparazzi \" . The duo lost the title in July 2005 . After their third and final reign ended in May 2006 , Nitro and Melina blamed Mercury for the loss and attacked him , splitting the team . Nitro and Melina were let go from the SmackDown ! roster and debuted on the Raw brand . In November 2006 , MNM reunited for a brief period , before Mercury was released from his contract in March 2007 . = = Concept = = Partly inspired by Paris Hilton , the concept behind the group was that they were Hollywood celebrities . Upon their debut on SmackDown ! , they claimed to be the \" hot new team on the scene \" , because of their good looks and celebrity status . As part of their in-ring personas , MNM had a distinctive ring entrance . They walked to the ring on a red carpet , while members of the \" paparazzi \" took photos of them . The male members of MNM usually wore fur coats to the ring . As they took them off , Melina suggestively rubbed their abs while removing the title belts from their pants , where they hung in an exaggerated phallic fashion .

Melina Perez , Johnny Nitro 's real-life girlfriend , was introduced into the company in 2004 as his ex-girlfriend , an ally of Matt Cappotelli with whom Nitro was engaged in a scripted rivalry . Almost immediately , however , Perez betrayed Cappotelli and sided with Nitro . Together they introduced Joey Matthews to become MNM . While in OVW , Nitro and Matthews won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship once , holding it for over two months . = = = SmackDown and dissolution ( 2005 \u2013 2006 ) = = = MNM was called up to WWE 's SmackDown ! roster in April 2005 , with Matthews undergoing a name change to \" Joey Mercury \" . They made their debut during Carlito 's interview segment Carlito 's Cabana , where they interrupted an interview between Carlito and Rey Mysterio , and attacked Mysterio . This provoked a feud between MNM and Mysterio and his partner , Eddie Guerrero , over the WWE Tag Team Championship . Two weeks later , in their debut match on the SmackDown ! brand , they defeated Mysterio and Guerrero to win the WWE Tag Team Championship after Guerrero refused to tag into the match . While Nitro and Mercury held the championship , Melina was placed in an angle with Heidenreich . She publicly mocked him and was the impetus for an attack on him by Nitro and Mercury . In July , MNM were scheduled to face Heidenreich in a two-on-one handicap match , but attacked him before the match started . Road Warrior Animal saved Heidenreich from the attack and as a result , Heidenreich and Road Warrior Animal challenged Mercury and Nitro for the tag team title at The Great American Bash . MNM lost the match and the championship . The loss of the tag team championship was seen as \" bad publicity \" by Melina so she introduced Jillian Hall , a storyline spin doctor to repair their image . Hall got them a cover article in SmackDown ! magazine , and began to introduce the team before and aid them during matches . In September 2005 , Hall left the group to join John \" Bradshaw \" Layfield ( JBL ) , who had lost a match to Rey Mysterio . On the October 28 episode of SmackDown ! , Mercury and Nitro were placed into a tag team title fatal four-way match against the teams of the Mexicools ( Super Crazy and Psicosis ) , William Regal and Paul Burchall , and the WWE Tag Team Champions Legion of Doom 2005 ( Heidenreich and Road Warrior Animal ) . During the match , Mercury and Nitro were able to perform the Snapshot on Heidenreich , to win the championship for a second time . MNM successfully defended the championship against Eddie Guerrero and Batista . In December , they began a feud with the Mexicools , who earned the right to face MNM at Armageddon for the WWE Tag Team Championship . Before Armageddon however , on the December 16 episode of SmackDown ! , MNM lost the tag team championship to Batista and Rey Mysterio . A storyline was begun before the match , where Melina attempted to seduce Batista into forfeiting the match . The storyline played over to the next episode of SmackDown ! when , before MNM invoked their rematch clause , Melina held a press conference in the ring where she claimed that Batista had sexually harassed her . During the tag team match , Mark Henry aided MNM in winning back the WWE Tag Team Championship . The following week , MNM defeated Batista and Mysterio in a steel cage match to retain the championship , Henry 's aid . Henry was only with the group a short time before his contract was sold to Daivari in storyline . They went on to successfully defend the championship against The Mexicools and the team of Matt Hardy and Tatanka in early 2006 . In April 2006 , MNM were placed in an angle in which they found themselves in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick . In non-title tag team matches , singles matches , and even a six-man tag match , London and Kendrick defeated the duo every time . At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006 , MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick . After the match , Nitro and Mercury started brawling , disbanding the group . Later that night , Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger , she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown ! brand in storyline .

MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon as part of a four-way ladder match , which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick . During the match , which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship , Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder , necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches . The facial injury was worked into the angle , and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face , the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure one or both of the Hardys , even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match . MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble , and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February , which concluded the feud . = = = Post-breakup = = = After their feud with the Hardys was over , Nitro and Melina continued to team on Raw , while Mercury wrestled in singles competition on SmackDown ! . On March 26 , 2007 , through WWE 's official website , it was announced that Mercury had been released from his contract . Mercury returned in 2010 , first as a member of CM Punk 's Straight Edge Society , and later began working as a trainer in Florida Championship Wrestling ( later renamed NXT Wrestling ) He most recently worked alongside The Authority and as part of J & J Security , former WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins 's \" personal security \" . Melina and Nitro 's association began to fizzle out when Melina became the WWE Women 's Champion and began garnering attention as a singles performer . Melina was released from her contract in 2011 . During the 2007 supplemental draft , Nitro moved to the ECW brand , renamed John Morrison in the ECW brand , & would go on to capture the ECW World Championship . Morrison formed a partnership with The Miz , capturing both the WWE Tag Team Championship and the World Tag Team Championship . He also gained his third WWE Intercontinental Championship shortly after his alliance with The Miz . Morrison departed from WWE in 2011 and signed with Lucha Underground in 2014 as Johnny Mundo .

As a newcomer to the U.S. trials , he made a dramatic statement by setting a new American record in the preliminary heats of the 200-meter freestyle . At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , he won three gold medals and a silver . He won his first Olympic gold medal by swimming the lead-off leg in the men 's 4 \u00d7 200-meter freestyle relay , and Heath and his American teammates David Larson , Jeff Float and Bruce Hayes set a new world record of 7 : 15.69 , edging the Michael Gross-led West Germans by four one-hundredths ( 0.04 ) of a second .

He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final ( 50.41 ) ; the outcome was controversial , however , because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines , the winner . Gaines ' coach , Richard Quick , knew of starter Frank Silvestri 's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks . Gaines gained about a meter 's head start on the competition ; video of the event later confirmed that one or more of the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired . After the 1984 Olympics , Heath continued to swim for the U.S. national team , and remained a fixture on the freestyle relay teams .

                    "text": "1973 Pacific hurricane season = The 1973 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology . The most important system this year was Hurricane Ava , which was the most intense Pacific hurricane known at the time . Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to , or made landfall on , the Pacific coast of Mexico . The most serious of these was Hurricane Irah , which downed power and communication lines in parts of the Baja California Peninsula ; the other landfalling storms caused rain and some flooding . No tropical cyclone this season caused any deaths . This season had a quick start but a slow end . Overall activity was below average , with twelve named systems in total . Of these , five were tropical storms , seven were hurricanes , of which three were major ( Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale ) . Just one storm formed in August , one of the least active Augusts ever in the east Pacific . The season officially started May 15 , 1973 in the eastern Pacific , and June 1 , 1973 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1973 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean , often off the coast of Mexico . As is usual in the northern hemisphere , most traveled generally westward or northwestward , and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands . = = Season summary = = The season began with the formation of the pre-Ava tropical depression on June 2 and ended with the dissipation of Tropical Lillian on October 9 . The season lasted a total of 129 days . No named storms formed in May , three in June , four in July , one in August , three in September , one in October , and none in November . Another six tropical depressions formed during the year , but data on them is unavailable . All of these tropical cyclones formed in the eastern north Pacific tropical cyclone basin , which encompasses the Pacific Ocean north of the equator east of 140 \u00b0 W. None formed in the central north Pacific , which is the remainder of the Pacific Ocean east of the international dateline . Of the tropical cyclones that formed this year , were twelve tropical storms and seven were hurricanes . Of those hurricanes , three of them were major hurricanes because they reached Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Scale . These totals are all below the long-term averages of thirteen tropical storms , nine hurricanes , and four major hurricanes . At the time , this season 's total of twelve named tropical cyclones was exactly average , although at the time the climatology in this basin was weak because satellite coverage was spotty before 1966 . This season , all advisories and tropical cyclone data were released and collected by two agencies , the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in Redwood City , California , and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu , Hawaii , both of which were coextensive with the National Weather Service Forecast Offices in their respective cities . The EPHC covered the area between the coast of North America and 140 \u00b0 W , and the CPHC the remainder of the area . = = = Hurricane Ava = = = A tropical depression formed on June 2 . It steadily strengthened and headed in a generally westerly direction . It moved slowly and became Hurricane Ava on June 4 . Two days later , it became a major hurricane and it sped up . On June 7 , it became a Category 5 hurricane . It then started weakening and slowed down until it dissipated on June 12 . No deaths or damages were attributed to Hurricane Ava . Ava 's minimum central pressure was 915 millibars , and its maximum sustained winds reached 140 knots ( 260 km / h ) . This made Ava the most intense recorded east Pacific hurricane at the time . Ava reached Category 5 intensity on June 7 , the earliest date in an east Pacific season that a hurricane has done so . It was also the second known Category 5 storm in the east Pacific ; ( behind Patsy in 1959 ) . Ava is the strongest June storm , the fifth most intense east Pacific hurricane , and was the only June Category 5 on record until 2010 . Ava was also flown into by hurricane hunter aircraft in what was the first penetration of a Pacific hurricane by NOAA aircraft . During these flights , radars and other devices were tested , and wind speed , pressure , and wave heights were measured . This is the reason why Hurricane Ava 's pressure is measured instead of estimated . Ava was also photographed from Skylab because it was visible during one of the missions . At that time , it was coincidentally on the surface of the Earth directly underneath the space station . All in all , these made Hurricane Ava one of the best-observed Pacific hurricanes at the time . = = = Tropical Storm Bernice = = = A nearly stationary disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone spent three days organizing and finally developed into a tropical depression on June 22 . The cyclone started heading northwest . After intensifying into a tropical storm , Bernice made landfall on June 23 at a location roughly 50 mi ( 80 km ) southwest of Zihuatanejo . It dissipated later that day . Bernice exposed two ships to gales , but otherwise neither deaths nor significant impact was reported . At its peak , Tropical Storm Bernice had winds of 70 miles per hour ( 110 km / h ) . = = = Tropical Storm Claudia = = = A tropical depression formed June 26 from a westward-moving area of disturbed weather . The next day , it developed gale-force winds and was named Claudia . Claudia headed northwesterly and then northwards and made landfall on June 28 approximately 30 mi ( 50 km ) east of Acapulco . It dissipated inland the next day . No deaths or casualties were reported due to this tropical cyclone . = = = Hurricane Doreen = = = On July 18 , a tropical storm formed from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and was named Doreen . It steadily intensified , and became a hurricane on July 19 . Doreen briefly reached Category 4 strength on July 21 with a relatively high central pressure of 972 mb ( 28.7 inHg ) . It then weakened steadily as its path carried it on a direct path to the Big Island of Hawaii . Doreen weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility on July 25 . A frontal system stuck between two high-pressure areas weakened as the two areas merged , creating a larger high pressure area that turned Doreen to the southwest on July 27 . The hurricane then turned back to the northwest and strengthened back into a hurricane . It became a major hurricane again before weakening . Doreen dissipated August 3 . Its remnant vortex continued westward until it dissipated under a trough near the dateline . Doreen 's sudden change of track and restrengthening was unusual . From formation to dissipation , Doreen lasted 16.25 days and traveled a distance of 4,200 mi ( 6,760 km ) . This tied Hurricane Celeste 's record for longest-lasting Pacific hurricane . Doreen was also the longest-lasting July tropical cyclone . Hurricane Fico broke both of these records in the 1978 season . Doreen remains the eighth-longest lasting Pacific tropical cyclone , tied with two other storms . Several ships encountered Doreen . The most serious incident involved a Greek ship called Cornelia which lost its rudder in 35 ft ( 10 m ) waves , but managed to escape and continue on its way to Panama . On the afternoon of July 29 , 9 ft ( 2.7 m ) swells and 3.5 ft ( 0 m ) waves were seen from Kapoho . Otherwise , no damages or deaths were blamed on this tropical cyclone . = = = Hurricane Emily = = = A depression formed July 21 from squalls in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and headed west-northwest and strengthened into a tropical storm . Emily continued moving nearly parallel to the coast before turning to the west while steadily intensifying . Emily eventually reached Category 4 intensity on July 22 . Emily then weakened as it turned to the northwest . It dissipated on July 28 . Emily 's wind field was large enough to bring gales areas 300 mi ( 480 km ) east of the hurricane from July 22 to 24 . This tropical cyclone caused no deaths or damage . = = = Hurricane Florence = = = On July 25 , a depression formed off the coast of Guatemala . The storm made a close approach to the Mexican coast as a depression , but did not make landfall . Just after that , it strengthened into a tropical storm . Florence headed west and then west-northwest . It became a hurricane on July 29 . It began weakening thereafter . Florence dissipated on July 30 . No damages or deaths were reported . = = = Tropical Storm Glenda = = = A depression that had formed on July 30 from a tropical disturbance quickly strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Glenda . It took a path similar to both Florence and Emily , but further from the shore . Glenda dissipated August 5 . At the time it still had winds of 40 knots ( 70 km / h ) , down from its peak of 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) . No deaths , damage , or other impact was reported . = = = Tropical Storm Heather = = = The only storm to form in August this year formed on August 31 from an area of circulation in the ITCZ over the Gulf of Tehuantepec . It became a tropical depression on August 30 . After moving northwest for a bit , it became a tropical storm and headed almost due north towards Mexico . Heather dissipated September 1 , just before making landfall . Tropical Storm Heather caused no deaths or damage to any location in the coastal area of the Gulf of Tehuantepec . = = = Hurricane Irah = = = A depression formed September 22 . It became a tropical storm on September 23 and a hurricane on September 24 . Irah took a northwesterly path and reached Category 2 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale , and then dropped back down to a 1 as it recurved . It made landfall on Baja California and entered the Gulf of California as a tropical storm , making landfall again in northwestern Mexico approximately 30 mi ( 50 km ) northwest of Los Mochis . Irah 's first landfall was the strongest of the season . The hurricane dissipated on September 27 while heading east-northeast over mainland Mexico . Irah blew over some power and communication lines during its passage over the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula . Heavy rain fell over parts of Mexico , with the highest total being 10.24 in ( 260 mm ) at Sierra de la Laguna . One person was injured and at least ten houses were destroyed in Cabo San Lucas . No one was killed . There was some concern that the hurricane could disrupt splashdown procedures for astronauts at the end of Skylab 3 ; however , the return to Earth was not seriously affected . = = = Tropical Storm Jennifer = = = On September 23 , another depression formed . It took a northeasterly path , rotating around the southern periphery of Hurricane Irah as part of a Fujiwara interaction . It strengthened into a tropical storm late on September 24 . The peak windspeed of this tropical cyclone was 40 miles per hour ( 60 km / h ) . Jennifer then weakened to a depression and turned to the north-northeast . Jennifer brushed the Islas Mar\u00edas . The cyclone made landfall near just southeast of Mazatl\u00e1n and dissipated September 27 . Tropical Depression Jennifer caused rain over several parts of Mexico . The highest total was 7.48 in ( 190 mm ) at Navarette / San Blas . No one was killed and no damage was reported . = = = Hurricane Katherine = = = Katherine became a tropical storm on September 29 , just six hours after forming . It headed out to sea . On October 1 , it became a hurricane . It peaked in windspeed the next day . After weakening to storm strength , it crossed 140 \u00b0 W and entered the central Pacific . Katherine continued its slightly south of westward track . It dropped to a depression on October 9 , and dissipated shortly after that due to the influence of a cold trough . The storm never threatened land , causing no casualties or damage . = = = Hurricane Lillian = = = A depression that formed October 5 reached storm strength the same day . It generally paralleled the coast of Mexico far offshore . Lillian reached minimal hurricane strength on October 7 and peaked the next day . The hurricane began to weaken immediately thereafter and dissipated on October 9 . Through its life , Lillian at first traveled generally west-northwestward , and then westward . Lillian never threatened land , causing no known impact . = = 1973 Storm Names = = These names were used for storms that formed in the eastern Pacific during this season . It is the same list used in the 1969 season . Storms were named Katherine and Lillian for the first time this year . No names were retired , so this list was used again in the 1977 season . Names that weren 't assigned are colored gray . The Central Pacific used names and numbers from the Western Pacific 's typhoon list . No systems formed in the area , and thus no names were required .",
