To facilitate loading and unloading the glider 's nose and tail sections were hinged to swing sideways. The Il-32 required a four-engined aircraft to tow it safely ; it was canceled when it became clear that no such tug was going to be available after the Tupolev Tu-75 and Ilyushin Il-18 programs were both canceled because of shortages of their intended Shvetsov ASh-73 engines. = = Development = = After the end of World War II the Soviets devoted a considerable amount of effort to developing heavy transport gliders to deliver troops during an airborne assault.",

Only two aircraft were built, one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and the other served as an armament testbed. Both prototypes were destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104 was the forerunner of over 2,500 Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. During the Korean War, USAF fighter pilots were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots. Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force.",

It specifically describes a prototype fighter aircraft designed for the United States Air Force, highlighting its role as a high-performance interceptor.

Several other much weaker tropical cyclones came close to, or made landfall on, the Pacific coast of Mexico.
