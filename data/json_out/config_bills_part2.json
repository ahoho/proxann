(Sec. 934) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require each NRSRO to refer to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities any information that it receives from a third party and finds credible that alleges that an issuer of securities rated by the NRSRO has committed or is committing a material violation of law that has not been adjudicated by a federal or state court. (Sec. 935) Requires an NRSRO, in producing a credit rating, to consider information which it finds credible that it has, or receives about an issuer from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, and which it finds potentially significant to a rating decision. (Sec. 936) Directs the SEC to: (1) prescribe qualification standards to ensure the accuracy of securities ratings issued by credit rating analysts; (2) require each NRSRO to establish and enforce written policies and procedures that assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will fail to make payments to investors in accordance with the terms of such instrument; and ( 3) define clearly and disclose the meaning of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating, and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of instruments for which it is used.

(Sec. 1472)Prescribes appraisal independence requirements. Declares unlawful specified acts or practices that violate such requirements in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. Includes among unfair and deceptive practices any appraisal of a property offered as security in which a person with an interest in the underlying transaction compensates, coerces, extorts, colludes, instructs, induces, bribes, or intimidates a person conducting or involved in the appraisal.

Directs the Secretary to assess annually to Congress the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full. (Sec. 1502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the eastern DRC , particularly sexual- and gender-based violence, and contributes to an emergency humanitarian situation therein, warranting certain disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to issue regulations requiring persons for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that person to make annual disclosures of whether any such conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country.

I have only used one so far and it is holding up nicely. I have been using it about 2-3 weeks.

Requires any hearing under this Act to be conducted in camera. Prohibits an in camera hearing, however, based on the assertion of the state secrets privilege, if the court determines that the hearing relates only to a question of law and does not present a risk of revealing state secrets. Allows a federal court to conduct hearings (or portions) ex parte if the court determines, following in camera review of the evidence, that the interests of justice and national security cannot adequately be protected through attorney security clearances, protective orders, sealed opinions or orders, and special masters. Requires a federal court, at the request of the United States, to limit participation in hearings, or access to motions or affidavits, to attorneys (including guardians ad litem) with appropriate security clearances, if the limiting participation in this manner would serve the interests of national security. Authorizes a court, If the United States fails to provide a necessary security clearance in a reasonable period of time, to review in camera and ex parte the reasons of the United States for denying or delaying the clearance to ensure that the United States is not withholding a security clearance from a particular attorney or class of attorneys for any reason other than protection of national security. Authorizes the United States to intervene in any civil action in order to protect information that may be subject to the state secrets privilege. Declares, however, that the state secrets privilege shall not constitute grounds for dismissal of a case or claim. Requires deferral pending completion of the hearings of any motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based in whole or in part on the state secrets privilege, or which may be affected by the assertion of the state secrets privilege, unless the motion can be granted on grounds unrelated to, and unaffected by, assertion of the privilege. Prescribes procedures for: (1) determining whether evidence is protected from disclosure by the state secrets privilege; and (2) when evidence protected by the state secrets privilege is necessary for adjudication of a claim or counterclaim. Requires the court to give substantial weight to an assertion by the United States relating to why public disclosure of an item of evidence would be reasonably likely to cause significant harm to the national defense or foreign relations of the United States.

Grants courts of appeal jurisdiction of an appeal by any party from any interlocutory decision or order of a U.S. district court. Requires the Attorney General within 30 days to report in writing to Congress on any case in which the United States asserts the state secrets privilege.

Repeals the requirement that any collateral subsequently retired or amortized be replaced by additional eligible collateral where needed to keep the percentage of the collateral value relative to the amount of the outstanding loan or extension of credit, guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit equal to the minimum percentage required at the transaction's inception. Declares unacceptable the use of a low-quality asset as collateral for credit exposure to an affiliate resulting from a bank's (or subsidiary's) securities borrowing or lending transaction, or derivative transaction.

Specifies that the application of a national bank to establish a de novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a branch may be approved if the law of the state where the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were a state bank chartered by such state. (Sec. 614) Amends the FRA regarding limits on credit extensions to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of member banks (insiders) to declare that a member bank shall be deemed to have extended credit to a person if the member bank has credit exposure to the person arising from a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction between the member bank and the person.

Amends the FDIA to direct the appropriate federal banking agency for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company to require such an entity to serve as a source of financial strength for any of its subsidiaries that is a depository institution. Defines \"source of financial strength\" as the ability of a company that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution to provide it with financial assistance if it experiences financial distress.

(Sec. 935) Requires an NRSRO, in producing a credit rating, to consider information which it finds credible that it has, or receives about an issuer from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, and which it finds potentially significant to a rating decision. (Sec. 936) Directs the SEC to: (1) prescribe qualification standards to ensure the accuracy of securities ratings issued by credit rating analysts; (2) require each NRSRO to establish and enforce written policies and procedures that assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will fail to make payments to investors in accordance with the terms of such instrument; and ( 3) define clearly and disclose the meaning of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating, and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of instruments for which it is used.

(Sec. 1472)Prescribes appraisal independence requirements. Declares unlawful specified acts or practices that violate such requirements in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. Includes among unfair and deceptive practices any appraisal of a property offered as security in which a person with an interest in the underlying transaction compensates, coerces, extorts, colludes, instructs, induces, bribes, or intimidates a person conducting or involved in the appraisal. Includes, in addition, among such practices: (1) mischaracterizing, or suborning mischaracterization of, the appraised value of the property securing the extension of the credit; (2) seeking to influence an appraiser or otherwise to encourage a targeted value in order to facilitate the transaction; and (3) withholding or threatening to withhold timely payment for an appraisal report or for appraisal services rendered. Prohibits a certified or licensed appraiser or appraisal management company from having an interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction involving the appraisal. Authorizes the Board, the CFPB, and designated federal agencies to jointly issue regulations addressing the issue of appraisal report portability, including regulations that ensure such portability between lenders for a consumer credit transaction secured by a 1-4 unit single family residence that is the principal dwelling of the consumer, or mortgage brokerage services for such a transaction. Subjects to civil penalties violations of appraisal independence requirements. Declares that the deference that a court accords to the CFPB with respect to its determination of the meaning or interpretation of any TILA provisions (except property appraisal requirements) shall be applied as if the CFPB were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer such provisions. (Sec. 1473) Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to condition the establishment by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and the Resolution Trust Corporation of a threshold level at or below which a certified or licensed appraiser is not required to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions on the agency's receiving concurrence from the CFPB that such threshold level provides reasonable protection for consumers who purchase 1-4 unit single-family residences. Directs the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to detail in its annual report to Congress: (1) the results of all audits of state appraiser regulatory agencies; and (2) an accounting of disapproved actions and warnings taken in the previous year, including the conditions causing the disapproval and the actions taken to achieve compliance. Requires Subcommittee meetings to be open to the public, but authorizes the closing of certain portions related to personnel and review of preliminary state audit reports. Requires the Subcommittee to: (1) monitor state requirements for the registration and supervision of an appraisal management company; and (2) maintain a national registry of appraisal management companies that either are registered with and subject to supervision of a state appraiser certifying and licensing agency or are operating subsidiaries of a federally regulated financial institution. Directs designated federal financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB, to jointly establish, by rule, minimum requirements a state must apply in the registration of appraisal management companies. Applies these same requirements to, and exempts from any state registration requirement, an appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and controlled by a financial institution and regulated by a federal financial institution regulatory age ncy. Sets forth: (1) registration limitations; (2) additional state agency reporting requirements; and (3) revised registry fees. Authorizes the Subcommittee to award grants to state appraiser certifying and licensing agencies in order to support their compliance with this Act. Requires the requirements for state licensing of an appraiser to meet or exceed the minimum cr iteria issued by the Appraisal Qualifications Board of The Appraisal Foundation for the licensing of real estate appraisers. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor whether each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency: (1) processes complaints and completes investigations in a reasonable time period; (2) appropriately disciplines sanctioned appraisers and appraisal management companies; (3) maintains an effective regulatory program; and (4) reports complaints and disciplinary actions on a timely basis to the national registries on appraisers and appraisal management companies. Authorizes the Subcommittee to: (1) remove a state licensed or certified appraiser or a registered appraisal management company from a national registry on an interim basis pending state agency action on licensing, certification, registration, and disciplinary proceedings; (2) impose sanctions against a state agency that fails to have an effective appraiser regulatory program; and (3) impose interim actions and suspensions against a state agency as an alternative to, or in advance of, derecognition of a state agency. Prohibits appraisal of a federally related transaction by a state- certified or -licensed appraiser unless the state appraiser certifying or licensing agency has in place a policy of issuing a reciprocal certification or license for an individual from another state who meets certain state licensure standards. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency to determine whether: (1) its policies, practices, and procedures are consistent with maintaining appraiser independence; and (2) such state has effective regulations, and policies regarding the maintenance of appraiser independence. Requires the Subcommittee to establish and operate an Appraisal Complaint National Hotline, including a toll-free telephone number and an email address. Requires designated federal financial institution regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Subcommittee,to promulgate regulations to implement quality control standards governing automated valuation models (computerized models used by mortgage originators and secondary market issuers to determine the collateral worth of a mortgage secured by a consumer's principal dwelling). Prohibits the use of broker price opinions as the primary basis to evaluate property for loan origination in connection with a residential mortgage loan secured by such property. (Defines broker price opinion as an estimate prepared by a real estate broker, agent, or sales person that: (1) details the probable selling price of a particular piece of real estate property; and (2) provides a varying level of detail about the property's condition, market, and neighborhood, and information on comparable sales; but (3) does not include an automated valuation model.) Amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to require that at all times at least one member of the Appraisal Subcommittee have demonstrated knowledge and competence through licensure, certification, or professional designation within the appraisal profession. (Sec. 1474) Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to revise requirements that creditors provide loan applicants a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with the loan application secured by a lien on residential real property. Repeals the condition that the loan applicant request the copy. Requires a creditor to furnish the applicant with a copy of all written appraisals and valuations within three days after the closing of the loan. (Sec. 1475) Amends RESPA to permit the standard real estate settlement form to disclose, in the case of an appraisal coordinated by an appraisal management company, the fee paid directly by the company to the appraiser and the company's administration fee. (Sec. 1476) Instructs the Government Accountability Office to study : (1) the effectiveness and impact of certain appraisal methods, models, and distribution channels; (2) the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC); and (3) certain Appraisal Subcommittee functions, including its ability to monitor and enforce state and federal certification requirements and standards. Subtitle G: Mortgage Resolution and Modification - (Sec. 1481) Directs the HUD Secretary to develop a program to ensure protection of current and future tenants and at-risk multifamily properties. Denies persons convicted within the last 10 years of specified crimes involving a mortgage or real estate transaction any eligibility for mortgage assistance from the Making Home Affordable Program authorized or funded by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. (Sec. 1482) Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the supplemental directives and other guidelines for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) of the Making Home Affordable initiative to require each mortgage servicer participating in HAMP to provide each borrower denied a mortgage modification with all borrower-related and mortgage-related input data used in any net present value (NPV) analyses performed in connection with the mortgage. Directs the Secretary to establish a public website that provides: (1) a calculator for NPV analyses of a mortgage, based on the Secretary's methodology for calculating such value, that mortgagors can use to enter information regarding their own mortgages; and (2) a determination after entering such information of whether such mortgage would be accepted or rejected for modification under the Program. (Sec. 1483) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the HAMP guidelines to make public the data being collected from each participating mortgage servicer and lender. (Sec. 1484) Amends the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act with respect to the requirement that any immediate successor in interest in residential real property pursuant to foreclosure of a federally-related mortgage loan assume that interest subject to certain conditions. Deems the date of a notice of such a foreclosure to be the date upon which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as a result of a court order or pursuant to provisions in a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed. Subtitle H: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1491) Expresses the sense of Congress that efforts to enhance the terms of residential mortgage credit and practices would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). (Sec. 1492) Directs the Comptroller General to study certain interagency efforts to crackdown on mortgage foreclosure rescue scams and loan modification fraud in order to advise Congress on the risks and vulnerabilities of emerging schemes in the loan modification arena. (Sec. 1493) Amends the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 to require each state to report certain mortgage data. (Sec. 1494) Directs the HUD Secretary to study the effect upon residential mortgage loan foreclosures of: (1) the presence of drywall imported from China between 2004 and the end of 2007; and (2) the availability of property insurance for residential structures in which such drywall is present. (Sec. 1496) Makes necessary sums available to the HUD Secretary to: (1) provide $1 billion in emergency mortgage assistance through the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Fund for such purpose. Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to permit emergency mortgage assistance if the mortgagor has incurred a substantial reduction in income as a result of involuntary unemployment or underemployment due to medical conditions. Revises requirements for emergency mortgage assistance to replace the maximum amount of $250 per month with an amount determined reasonably necessary to supplement what the homeowner is capable of contributing toward the mortgage payment. Caps the aggregate amount of such assistance to any homeowner at $50,000. Makes the interest rate fixed for the life of an insured loan or credit advance. Limits the interest rate to that generally charged for HUD-insured mortgages on single-family housing. Prohibits the charging of any interest on deferred interest on such a loan or credit advance. Requires the Secretary, in establishing rates, terms, and conditions for loans or advances of credit, to take into account a homeowner's ability to repay such loan or credit advance. Authorizes any eligible homeowner who receives such a grant or credit advance to repay the loan in full, without penalty, by lump sum or by installment payments at any time before it becomes due and payable. Repeals the 40% cap on the total amount of loans and credit advances by a financial institution that may be insured, and the 90% cap on the payment of any single loss claim that may be paid out. Increases from $1.5 billion to $3 billion the cap on the aggregate amount of insured loans and advances, but includes emergency mortgage relief payments in such amount. Directs the Secretary to establish underwriting guidelines or procedures to allocate amounts made available for incurred loans and advances and for emergency relief payments, based on the likelihood that a mortgagor will be able to resume mortgage payments. Repeals the authorization of appropriations for the emergency mortgage relief program, but extends through FY2011 the authority to insure loans and credit advances under the program and to make emergency mortgage relief payments. Repeals the authority of each federal supervisory agency to waive or relax limitations pertaining to their operations with respect to mortgage delinquencies in order to cause or encourage forebearance in residential mortgage loan foreclosures. Repeals certain reporting requirements as well as the authority of the FDIC to make credit advances to insured banks to facilitate their participation in the emergency mortgage relief program. (Sec. 1497) Makes $1 billion available to the HUD Secretary for assistance to state and local governments for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes. (Sec. 1498) Directs the HUD Secretary to establish a grants program to provide a full range of foreclosure legal assistance to low- and moderate-income homeowners and tenants related to home ownership preservation, home foreclosure prevention, and tenancy associated with home foreclosure. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2012. Title XV: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1501) Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to: (1) evaluate, before consideration by the IMF Board of Executive Directors, any proposal to make a loan to a country whose public debt exceeds its gross domestic product if that country is not eligible for assistance from the International Development Association; and (2) oppose the proposal if such evaluation indicates the proposed loan is unlikely to be repaid in full. Directs the Secretary to assess annually to Congress the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full. (Sec. 1502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the eastern DRC , particularly sexual- and gender-based violence, and contributes to an emergency humanitarian situation therein, warranting certain disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to issue regulations requiring persons for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that person to make annual disclosures of whether any such conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country. Requires the report, regarding any minerals that did originate in the DRC or an adjoining country, to describe: (1) due diligence measures taken on the source and chain of custody of such minerals; and (2) the products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, that are not DRC conflict free. Defines \"DRC conflict free\" as products that do not contain minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country. Instructs the Secretary of State to: (1) submit to Congress a strategy to address the linkages between human rights abuses, armed groups, mining of conflict minerals, and commercial products; (2) produce and update periodically a map, available to the public, of mineral-rich zones, trade routes, and areas under the control of armed groups in the DRC and adjoining countries (\"Conflict Minerals Map\"); and (3) publish in the Federal Register a notice of intent to declare a mineral a conflict mineral. Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the rate of sexual- and gender-based violence in war-torn areas of the DRC and adjoining countries; and (2) the effectiveness of these newly required reports in promoting peace and security in such countries. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to assess for Congress the accuracy of independent private sector audits and other due diligence processes. (Sec. 1503) Requires securities issuers required to report to the SEC that are coal or other mine operators, or that have subsidiaries that are mine operators, to include in periodic reports to the SEC, among other things, the total number per mine of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard for which the operator received a citation from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Requires reports, also, of imminent danger orders and written notices of patterns of violations of such standards, or the potential to have such a pattern. (Sec. 1504) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to: (1) promulgate final rules requiring each resource extraction issuer to include in its annual report information, in an interactive data format, detailing any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary, or an entity under its control to a foreign government or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals; and (2) make a compilation of such information publicly accessible online. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 1505) Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the relative independence, effectiveness, and expertise of presidentially appointed inspectors general and inspectors general of designated federal entities; and (2) the effects on independence of the amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978 made by this Act. (Sec. 1506) Directs the FDIC to evaluate for Congress: (1) the definition of core deposits for the purpose of calculating the insurance premiums of banks; (2) the potential impact on the Deposit Insurance Fund of revising the definitions of brokered deposits and core deposits to better distinguish between them; (3) the differences between core deposits and brokered deposits and their role in the economy and the domestic banking sector; (4) the potential stimulative effect on local economies of redefining core deposits; and (5) the competitive parity between large institutions and community banks that could result from redefining core deposits. Title XVI: Section 1256 Contracts - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the definition of a Section 1256 contract any interest rate swap, currency swap, basis swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor, commodity swap, equity swap, equity index swap, credit default swap, or similar agreement. (Thus shields such instruments from treatment as sold for its fair market value [marked to market] on the last business day of the taxable year for capital gains or loss taxation purposes).",

Repeals the requirement that any collateral subsequently retired or amortized be replaced by additional eligible collateral where needed to keep the percentage of the collateral value relative to the amount of the outstanding loan or extension of credit, guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit equal to the minimum percentage required at the transaction's inception. Declares unacceptable the use of a low-quality asset as collateral for credit exposure to an affiliate resulting from a bank's (or subsidiary's) securities borrowing or lending transaction, or derivative transaction.

(Sec. 611) Amends the FDIA to allow a state bank to engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which it is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions. (Sec. 612) Amends the National Bank Consolidation and Merger Act, the Revised Statutes, and HOLA to prohibit certain conversions between national and state banks and savings associations by banks and thrifts subject to certain cease and desist or other formal enforcement orders. Cites conditions for exemption from such prohibition.

Specifies that the application of a national bank to establish a de novo branch in a state in which the bank does not maintain a branch may be approved if the law of the state where the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch if the bank were a state bank chartered by such state. (Sec. 614) Amends the FRA regarding limits on credit extensions to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of member banks (insiders) to declare that a member bank shall be deemed to have extended credit to a person if the member bank has credit exposure to the person arising from a derivative transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction, or securities borrowing transaction between the member bank and the person.

Amends the FDIA to direct the appropriate federal banking agency for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company to require such an entity to serve as a source of financial strength for any of its subsidiaries that is a depository institution. Defines \"source of financial strength\" as the ability of a company that directly or indirectly owns or controls an insured depository institution to provide it with financial assistance if it experiences financial distress.

(Sec. 934) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require each NRSRO to refer to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities any information that it receives from a third party and finds credible that alleges that an issuer of securities rated by the NRSRO has committed or is committing a material violation of law that has not been adjudicated by a federal or state court. (Sec. 935) Requires an NRSRO, in producing a credit rating, to consider information which it finds credible that it has, or receives about an issuer from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, and which it finds potentially significant to a rating decision. (Sec. 936) Directs the SEC to: (1) prescribe qualification standards to ensure the accuracy of securities ratings issued by credit rating analysts; (2) require each NRSRO to establish and enforce written policies and procedures that assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will fail to make payments to investors in accordance with the terms of such instrument; and ( 3) define clearly and disclose the meaning of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating, and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of instruments for which it is used.

Includes among unfair and deceptive practices any appraisal of a property offered as security in which a person with an interest in the underlying transaction compensates, coerces, extorts, colludes, instructs, induces, bribes, or intimidates a person conducting or involved in the appraisal. Includes, in addition, among such practices: (1) mischaracterizing, or suborning mischaracterization of, the appraised value of the property securing the extension of the credit; (2) seeking to influence an appraiser or otherwise to encourage a targeted value in order to facilitate the transaction; and (3) withholding or threatening to withhold timely payment for an appraisal report or for appraisal services rendered. Prohibits a certified or licensed appraiser or appraisal management company from having an interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction involving the appraisal. Authorizes the Board, the CFPB, and designated federal agencies to jointly issue regulations addressing the issue of appraisal report portability, including regulations that ensure such portability between lenders for a consumer credit transaction secured by a 1-4 unit single family residence that is the principal dwelling of the consumer, or mortgage brokerage services for such a transaction. Subjects to civil penalties violations of appraisal independence requirements. Declares that the deference that a court accords to the CFPB with respect to its determination of the meaning or interpretation of any TILA provisions (except property appraisal requirements) shall be applied as if the CFPB were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer such provisions. (Sec. 1473) Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to condition the establishment by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and the Resolution Trust Corporation of a threshold level at or below which a certified or licensed appraiser is not required to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions on the agency's receiving concurrence from the CFPB that such threshold level provides reasonable protection for consumers who purchase 1-4 unit single-family residences. Directs the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to detail in its annual report to Congress: (1) the results of all audits of state appraiser regulatory agencies; and (2) an accounting of disapproved actions and warnings taken in the previous year, including the conditions causing the disapproval and the actions taken to achieve compliance. Requires Subcommittee meetings to be open to the public, but authorizes the closing of certain portions related to personnel and review of preliminary state audit reports. Requires the Subcommittee to: (1) monitor state requirements for the registration and supervision of an appraisal management company; and (2) maintain a national registry of appraisal management companies that either are registered with and subject to supervision of a state appraiser certifying and licensing agency or are operating subsidiaries of a federally regulated financial institution. Directs designated federal financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB, to jointly establish, by rule, minimum requirements a state must apply in the registration of appraisal management companies. Applies these same requirements to, and exempts from any state registration requirement, an appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and controlled by a financial institution and regulated by a federal financial institution regulatory age ncy. Sets forth: (1) registration limitations; (2) additional state agency reporting requirements; and (3) revised registry fees. Authorizes the Subcommittee to award grants to state appraiser certifying and licensing agencies in order to support their compliance with this Act. Requires the requirements for state licensing of an appraiser to meet or exceed the minimum cr iteria issued by the Appraisal Qualifications Board of The Appraisal Foundation for the licensing of real estate appraisers. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor whether each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency: (1) processes complaints and completes investigations in a reasonable time period; (2) appropriately disciplines sanctioned appraisers and appraisal management companies; (3) maintains an effective regulatory program; and (4) reports complaints and disciplinary actions on a timely basis to the national registries on appraisers and appraisal management companies. Authorizes the Subcommittee to: (1) remove a state licensed or certified appraiser or a registered appraisal management company from a national registry on an interim basis pending state agency action on licensing, certification, registration, and disciplinary proceedings; (2) impose sanctions against a state agency that fails to have an effective appraiser regulatory program; and (3) impose interim actions and suspensions against a state agency as an alternative to, or in advance of, derecognition of a state agency. Prohibits appraisal of a federally related transaction by a state- certified or -licensed appraiser unless the state appraiser certifying or licensing agency has in place a policy of issuing a reciprocal certification or license for an individual from another state who meets certain state licensure standards. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency to determine whether: (1) its policies, practices, and procedures are consistent with maintaining appraiser independence; and (2) such state has effective regulations, and policies regarding the maintenance of appraiser independence. Requires the Subcommittee to establish and operate an Appraisal Complaint National Hotline, including a toll-free telephone number and an email address. Requires designated federal financial institution regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Subcommittee,to promulgate regulations to implement quality control standards governing automated valuation models (computerized models used by mortgage originators and secondary market issuers to determine the collateral worth of a mortgage secured by a consumer's principal dwelling). Prohibits the use of broker price opinions as the primary basis to evaluate property for loan origination in connection with a residential mortgage loan secured by such property. (Defines broker price opinion as an estimate prepared by a real estate broker, agent, or sales person that: (1) details the probable selling price of a particular piece of real estate property; and (2) provides a varying level of detail about the property's condition, market, and neighborhood, and information on comparable sales; but (3) does not include an automated valuation model.) Amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to require that at all times at least one member of the Appraisal Subcommittee have demonstrated knowledge and competence through licensure, certification, or professional designation within the appraisal profession. (Sec. 1474) Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to revise requirements that creditors provide loan applicants a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with the loan application secured by a lien on residential real property. Repeals the condition that the loan applicant request the copy. Requires a creditor to furnish the applicant with a copy of all written appraisals and valuations within three days after the closing of the loan. (Sec. 1475) Amends RESPA to permit the standard real estate settlement form to disclose, in the case of an appraisal coordinated by an appraisal management company, the fee paid directly by the company to the appraiser and the company's administration fee. (Sec. 1476) Instructs the Government Accountability Office to study : (1) the effectiveness and impact of certain appraisal methods, models, and distribution channels; (2) the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC); and (3) certain Appraisal Subcommittee functions, including its ability to monitor and enforce state and federal certification requirements and standards. Subtitle G: Mortgage Resolution and Modification - (Sec. 1481) Directs the HUD Secretary to develop a program to ensure protection of current and future tenants and at-risk multifamily properties. Denies persons convicted within the last 10 years of specified crimes involving a mortgage or real estate transaction any eligibility for mortgage assistance from the Making Home Affordable Program authorized or funded by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. (Sec. 1482) Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the supplemental directives and other guidelines for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) of the Making Home Affordable initiative to require each mortgage servicer participating in HAMP to provide each borrower denied a mortgage modification with all borrower-related and mortgage-related input data used in any net present value (NPV) analyses performed in connection with the mortgage. Directs the Secretary to establish a public website that provides: (1) a calculator for NPV analyses of a mortgage, based on the Secretary's methodology for calculating such value, that mortgagors can use to enter information regarding their own mortgages; and (2) a determination after entering such information of whether such mortgage would be accepted or rejected for modification under the Program. (Sec. 1483) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the HAMP guidelines to make public the data being collected from each participating mortgage servicer and lender. (Sec. 1484) Amends the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act with respect to the requirement that any immediate successor in interest in residential real property pursuant to foreclosure of a federally-related mortgage loan assume that interest subject to certain conditions. Deems the date of a notice of such a foreclosure to be the date upon which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as a result of a court order or pursuant to provisions in a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed. Subtitle H: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1491) Expresses the sense of Congress that efforts to enhance the terms of residential mortgage credit and practices would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). (Sec. 1492) Directs the Comptroller General to study certain interagency efforts to crackdown on mortgage foreclosure rescue scams and loan modification fraud in order to advise Congress on the risks and vulnerabilities of emerging schemes in the loan modification arena. (Sec. 1493) Amends the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 to require each state to report certain mortgage data. (Sec. 1494) Directs the HUD Secretary to study the effect upon residential mortgage loan foreclosures of: (1) the presence of drywall imported from China between 2004 and the end of 2007; and (2) the availability of property insurance for residential structures in which such drywall is present. (Sec. 1496) Makes necessary sums available to the HUD Secretary to: (1) provide $1 billion in emergency mortgage assistance through the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Fund for such purpose. Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to permit emergency mortgage assistance if the mortgagor has incurred a substantial reduction in income as a result of involuntary unemployment or underemployment due to medical conditions. Revises requirements for emergency mortgage assistance to replace the maximum amount of $250 per month with an amount determined reasonably necessary to supplement what the homeowner is capable of contributing toward the mortgage payment. Caps the aggregate amount of such assistance to any homeowner at $50,000. Makes the interest rate fixed for the life of an insured loan or credit advance. Limits the interest rate to that generally charged for HUD-insured mortgages on single-family housing. Prohibits the charging of any interest on deferred interest on such a loan or credit advance. Requires the Secretary, in establishing rates, terms, and conditions for loans or advances of credit, to take into account a homeowner's ability to repay such loan or credit advance. Authorizes any eligible homeowner who receives such a grant or credit advance to repay the loan in full, without penalty, by lump sum or by installment payments at any time before it becomes due and payable. Repeals the 40% cap on the total amount of loans and credit advances by a financial institution that may be insured, and the 90% cap on the payment of any single loss claim that may be paid out. Increases from $1.5 billion to $3 billion the cap on the aggregate amount of insured loans and advances, but includes emergency mortgage relief payments in such amount. Directs the Secretary to establish underwriting guidelines or procedures to allocate amounts made available for incurred loans and advances and for emergency relief payments, based on the likelihood that a mortgagor will be able to resume mortgage payments. Repeals the authorization of appropriations for the emergency mortgage relief program, but extends through FY2011 the authority to insure loans and credit advances under the program and to make emergency mortgage relief payments. Repeals the authority of each federal supervisory agency to waive or relax limitations pertaining to their operations with respect to mortgage delinquencies in order to cause or encourage forebearance in residential mortgage loan foreclosures. Repeals certain reporting requirements as well as the authority of the FDIC to make credit advances to insured banks to facilitate their participation in the emergency mortgage relief program. (Sec. 1497) Makes $1 billion available to the HUD Secretary for assistance to state and local governments for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes. (Sec. 1498) Directs the HUD Secretary to establish a grants program to provide a full range of foreclosure legal assistance to low- and moderate-income homeowners and tenants related to home ownership preservation, home foreclosure prevention, and tenancy associated with home foreclosure. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2012. Title XV: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1501) Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to: (1) evaluate, before consideration by the IMF Board of Executive Directors, any proposal to make a loan to a country whose public debt exceeds its gross domestic product if that country is not eligible for assistance from the International Development Association; and (2) oppose the proposal if such evaluation indicates the proposed loan is unlikely to be repaid in full. Directs the Secretary to assess annually to Congress the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full. (Sec. 1502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the eastern DRC , particularly sexual- and gender-based violence, and contributes to an emergency humanitarian situation therein, warranting certain disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to issue regulations requiring persons for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that person to make annual disclosures of whether any such conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country. Requires the report, regarding any minerals that did originate in the DRC or an adjoining country, to describe: (1) due diligence measures taken on the source and chain of custody of such minerals; and (2) the products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, that are not DRC conflict free. Defines \"DRC conflict free\" as products that do not contain minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country. Instructs the Secretary of State to: (1) submit to Congress a strategy to address the linkages between human rights abuses, armed groups, mining of conflict minerals, and commercial products; (2) produce and update periodically a map, available to the public, of mineral-rich zones, trade routes, and areas under the control of armed groups in the DRC and adjoining countries (\"Conflict Minerals Map\"); and (3) publish in the Federal Register a notice of intent to declare a mineral a conflict mineral. Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the rate of sexual- and gender-based violence in war-torn areas of the DRC and adjoining countries; and (2) the effectiveness of these newly required reports in promoting peace and security in such countries. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to assess for Congress the accuracy of independent private sector audits and other due diligence processes. (Sec. 1503) Requires securities issuers required to report to the SEC that are coal or other mine operators, or that have subsidiaries that are mine operators, to include in periodic reports to the SEC, among other things, the total number per mine of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard for which the operator received a citation from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Requires reports, also, of imminent danger orders and written notices of patterns of violations of such standards, or the potential to have such a pattern. (Sec. 1504) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to: (1) promulgate final rules requiring each resource extraction issuer to include in its annual report information, in an interactive data format, detailing any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary, or an entity under its control to a foreign government or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals; and (2) make a compilation of such information publicly accessible online. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 1505) Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the relative independence, effectiveness, and expertise of presidentially appointed inspectors general and inspectors general of designated federal entities; and (2) the effects on independence of the amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978 made by this Act. (Sec. 1506) Directs the FDIC to evaluate for Congress: (1) the definition of core deposits for the purpose of calculating the insurance premiums of banks; (2) the potential impact on the Deposit Insurance Fund of revising the definitions of brokered deposits and core deposits to better distinguish between them; (3) the differences between core deposits and brokered deposits and their role in the economy and the domestic banking sector; (4) the potential stimulative effect on local economies of redefining core deposits; and (5) the competitive parity between large institutions and community banks that could result from redefining core deposits. Title XVI: Section 1256 Contracts - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the definition of a Section 1256 contract any interest rate swap, currency swap, basis swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor, commodity swap, equity swap, equity index swap, credit default swap, or similar agreement. (Thus shields such instruments from treatment as sold for its fair market value [marked to market] on the last business day of the taxable year for capital gains or loss taxation purposes).",

Directs the Board to require a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or a Board-supervised nonbank financial company (but not any federal home loan bank) to maintain a debt to equity ratio of no more than 15 to 1, upon Council determination that the company poses a grave threat to the U.S. financial stability and that this requirement is necessary to mitigate that risk.

Exempts from such requirement an order issued: (1) in connection with an actual or potential violation of either the Commodity Exchange Act or the securities laws; or (2) in certain federal administrative proceedings conducted on the record. Directs the CFTC and the SEC to prescribe joint implementing regulations regarding specified mixed swaps. Denies jurisdiction to the CFTC and registered futures organizations over security-based swaps, and to the SEC and registered national securities associations over swaps, except as otherwise authorized by this title. Retains the authority of a registered futures or national securities association, however, to examine for compliance with, and enforce, its rules on capital adequacy. Prescribes a procedure for judicial review of final rules, regulations, or orders of either the CFTC or the SEC if the other objects on jurisdictional grounds. Requires the Financial Stability Oversight Council to engage in dispute resolution if the CFTC and the SEC fail to prescribe such joint rules in a timely manner.

Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to authorize a registered futures commission merchant that is also a registered securities broker or dealer to hold in a portfolio margining account carried as a securities account any contract for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract), and any money, securities or other property received from a customer to margin, guarantee, or secure such a contract, or accruing to a customer as the result of such a contract. Directs the CFTC to exercise its authority to ensure that securities held in a portfolio margining account carried as a futures account are customer property and the owners of those accounts are customers for purposes of the Commodity Broker Liquidation requirements of federal bankruptcy law.

(Sec. 715) Authorizes either the CFTC or the SEC to prohibit an entity domiciled in a foreign country from participating in the United States in any swap or security-based swap activities if the regulation of swaps or security-based swaps markets in that foreign country undermines the stability of the U.S. financial system. (Sec. 716) Prohibits federal assistance to a swaps entity with respect to any swap, security-based swap, or other activity. Excludes from the definition of \"swaps entity\" any major swap participant or major security-based swap participant that is an insured depository institution. Declares this prohibition against federal assistance to a swap entity inapplicable to certain Federal Reserve-supervised and insured depository institutions owning or establishing an affiliate which is a swaps entity in compliance with the Federal Reserve Act and CFTC or SEC requirements. Applies such prohibition to any insured depository institution, however, unless it limits its swap or security-based swap activities to: (1) hedging and other similar risk mitigating activities directly related to the institution's activities; and (2) acting as a swaps entity for swaps or security-based swaps involving rates or reference assets that are permissible for investment by a national bank. Denies consideration as a bank permissible activity, however, acting as a swaps entity for credit default swaps, including swaps or security-based swaps referencing the credit risk of asset-backed securities, unless such swaps or security-based swaps are cleared by a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) or a clearing agency that is registered, or exempt from registration, as a DCO under the Commodity Exchange Act or as a clearing agency under the Securities Exchange Act, respectively. Requires liquidation (termination or transfer) of all swaps or security-based swap activities of swaps entities that are: (1) FDIC institutions that are put into receivership or declared insolvent as a result of such swaps or activities; or (2) institutions posing a systemic risk and subject to heightened prudential supervision that are put into receivership or declared insolvent as a result of such swaps or activities. Prohibits the use of taxpayer funds or resources: (1) to prevent the receivership of any swap entity resulting from its swap or security-based swap activity; or (2) for the orderly liquidation of any swaps entities that are non-FDIC insured, non-systemically significant institutions not subject to heightened prudential supervision. Requires recovery of all funds expended on the termination or transfer of the swap or security-based swap activity of a swaps entity from the disposition of the entity's assets or through assessments, including assessments on the financial sector. Prescribes rules for the conduct of swaps or security-based swap activities by a bank or bank holding company permitted to be or become a swap entity. Authorizes the Financial Stability Oversight Council to determine that swaps entities may no longer access federal assistance with respect to any swaps or security-based swap activities whenever provisions established by this Act are insufficient to effectively mitigate systemic risk and protect taxpayers. Requires an insured depository institution to comply with this Act's prohibition against proprietary trading in derivatives. (Sec. 717) Amends the Commodity Exchange Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to: (1) prescribe a CFTC approval process for new products, including puts, calls, or other options on securities; and (2) deem a security any agreement, contract, or transaction (or class of such, including securities-related derivatives) exempted from restrictions on futures trading by the CTFC with the condition that the SEC exercise concurrent jurisdiction over the agreement, contract, or transaction (or class). (Sec. 718) Sets forth a process for the CFTC or the SEC to determine the status of novel derivative products.

(Sec. 720) Directs the CFTC and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to negotiate and submit to Congress a memorandum of understanding to establish procedures for: (1) applying their respective authorities in a manner to ensure effective regulation in the public interest; (2) resolving conflicts concerning overlapping jurisdiction between the two agencies; (3) avoiding conflicting or duplicative regulation; and (4) sharing information where either Commission is investigating potential manipulation, fraud, or market power abuse in markets within its purview. Part II: Regulation of Swap Markets - (Sec. 722) Amends the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) with respect to CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over accounts, agreements and transactions involving swaps, and contracts of sale executed on a swaps execution facility. States that such CFTC jurisdiction limits neither the jurisdiction conferred by this Act upon the SEC with respect to security-based swap agreements and security-based swaps, nor SEC authority with respect to related agreements, contracts, or transactions. Amends the CEA to prohibit a swap from being: (1) considered to be insurance; and (2) regulated as an insurance contract under state law. Excludes from CFTC jurisdiction swaps activities outside the United States, unless they: (1) have a direct, significant connection with activities in, or effect upon, U.S. commerce; or (2) contravene CFTC regulations.

States that CFTC jurisdiction does not limit or affect the authority of FERC or a state regulatory authority with respect to an agreement, contract, or transaction entered into pursuant to a FERC- or state-approved tariff or rate schedule that is not executed, traded, or cleared on a registered entity or trading facility, or on one owned or operated by a regional transmission organization or independent system operator.

(Sec. 724) Declares that it is unlawful for any person who is not registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant to accept money, securities, or property (or to extend credit in lieu of them) from, for, or on behalf of a swaps customer to margin, guarantee, or secure a swap cleared by or through a DCO (including money, securities, or property accruing to the customer as the result of such a swap). Requires a futures commission merchant to treat as belonging to the swaps customer, and deal as such, with all money, securities, and property of any swaps customer received to margin, guarantee, or secure a swap cleared by or though a DCO.

Allows the commingling of such assets, however, and their deposit in the same account or accounts with any bank or trust company or with a DCO, as well as their withdrawal for specified business purposes. Deems a swap cleared by or through a DCO to be a commodity contract with regard to all money, securities, and property of any swaps customer received by a futures commission merchant or a DCO to margin, guarantee, or secure the swap (including money, securities, or property accruing to the customer as the result of the swap).

Amends the Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000 to revise the exclusion of identified banking products from the application of the CEA and from CFTC jurisdiction. Allows an exception to this exclusion for swaps or security-based swaps (thus subjecting them to federal banking agency regulation).

Instructs the SEC to issue rules to prevent the sales and marketing considerations of an NRSRO from influencing its production of ratings. Requires each NRSRO to establish policies and procedures to ensure a look-back review to determine whether a conflict of interest exists in any case in which an employee of a person subject to an NRSRO credit rating, or of the issuer, underwriter, or sponsor of a security or money market instrument subject to an NRSRO credit rating, was employed by the NRSRO and participated in determining credit ratings for the person or the securities or money market instruments during the one-year period preceding the date an action was taken with respect to the credit rating.

Prohibits the designated compliance officer of an NRSRO from: (1) performing credit ratings; (2) participate in the development of ratings methodologies or models; (3) perform marketing or sales functions; or (4) participate in establishing compensation levels, other than for the compliance officer's employees. Authorizes the SEC to exempt a small NRSRO from these limitations if it finds that compliance with them would impose an unreasonable burden. Directs the SEC to: (1) establish an Office of Credit Ratings to administer its rules with respect to NRSRO practices in determining ratings, for the protection of users of credit ratings and in the public interest; (2) require each NRSRO to disclose publicly information on the initial credit ratings it has determined for each type of obligor, security, and money market instrument, and any subsequent changes to such ratings, in order to allow users of credit ratings to evaluate their accuracy and compare the performance of ratings by different NRSROs; and (3) prescribe rules, for the protection of investors and in the public interest, regarding the procedures and methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative data and models, used by NRSROs.

Requires at least half, but not fewer than two of the members of an NRSRO's board of directors to be independent of the NRSRO agency. Requires a portion of the independent directors to include users of ratings from a NRSRO. Prescribes criteria to determine such independence. (Sec. 933) Declares that in private actions against an NRSRO it shall be sufficient for pleading any required state of mind that the complaint state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the NRSRO knowingly or recklessly failed to: (1) conduct a reasonable investigation of the rated security with respect to the factual elements relied upon by its own methodology for evaluating credit risk; or (2) obtain reasonable verification of such factual elements (by audit or even by a sampling technique) from other sources that the credit rating agency considered to be competent and that were independent of the issuer and underwriter. (Sec. 934) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require each NRSRO to refer to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities any information that it receives from a third party and finds credible that alleges that an issuer of securities rated by the NRSRO has committed or is committing a material violation of law that has not been adjudicated by a federal or state court. (Sec. 935) Requires an NRSRO, in producing a credit rating, to consider information which it finds credible that it has, or receives about an issuer from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, and which it finds potentially significant to a rating decision. (Sec. 936) Directs the SEC to: (1) prescribe qualification standards to ensure the accuracy of securities ratings issued by credit rating analysts; (2) require each NRSRO to establish and enforce written policies and procedures that assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will fail to make payments to investors in accordance with the terms of such instrument; and ( 3) define clearly and disclose the meaning of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating, and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of instruments for which it is used. (Sec. 939) Amends the FDIA, the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Revised Statutes, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to remove references to credit ratings to reflect the provisions of this Act.

(Sec. 939D) Directs the Comptroller to study and report to Congress on: (1) alternative means for compensating NRSROs in order to create incentives for more accurate credit ratings; and (2) the feasibility and merits of creating an independent professional organization for NRSRO rating analysts responsible for establishing independent professional standards and a code of ethical conduct, as well as overseeing the profession. (Sec. 939F) Directs the SEC to study and report to Congress on: (1) the credit rating process for structured finance products and the conflicts of interest associated with the issuer-pay and the subscriber-pay models; (2) the feasibility of establishing a system in which a public or private utility or an SRO assigns NRSROs to determine the credit ratings of such products; and (3) alternative means for compensating NRSROs that would create incentives for accurate credit ratings. (Sec. 939G) Declares without force or effect Rule 436(g) promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933. (Rule 436(g) exempts credit ratings provided by NRSROs from being considered a part of the registration statement prepared or certified by a person under such Act.) (Sec. 939H) Expresses the sense of Congress that the SEC should exercise specified rulemaking authority to prevent improper conflicts of interest arising from employees of NRSROs providing services to issuers of securities that are unrelated to the issuance of credit ratings, including consulting, advisory, and other services.

(Sec. 955) Directs the SEC to require each issuer to disclose, in any proxy or consent solicitation material for an shareholders' annual meeting, whether any employee or member of the board of directors, including designees, is permitted to purchase financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of equity securities granted as part of a compensation package, or held by them. (Sec. 956) Directs federal regulators to jointly prescribe regulations requiring depository institutions or depository institution holding companies to disclose the structures of all incentive-based compensation arrangements in order to determine whether such structure: (1) provides excessive compensation, fees, or benefits to an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder; or (2) could lead to material financial loss to such institutions. Directs federal regulators to jointly prescribe regulations prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements that the regulators determine encourage inappropriate risks by such institutions by providing an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits, or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution. Exempts financial institutions with assets of less than $1 billion from such compensation restrictions. (Sec. 957) Prohibits registration as a national securities exchange unless the rules of the exchange prohibit any member that is not the beneficial owner of a specified registered security from granting a proxy to vote in connection with a certain shareholder vote unless the security's beneficial owner has instructed the member to vote the proxy in accordance with the owner's voting instructions.

(Sec. 1433) Prescribes additional requirements for certain mortgages. Prohibits a creditor from: (1) recommending default on an existing debt prior to and in connection with the closing of a high-cost mortgage that refinances any portion of such debt; (2) imposing late payment fees in connection with a high-cost mortgage except in compliance with specified requirements; (3) accelerating debt on a high-cost mortgage (except in certain circumstances); or (4) financing, in connection with any high-cost mortgage, either a prepayment fee or penalty payable by the consumer if the creditor is the note holder of the note being refinanced. Prohibits the creditor of a high-cost mortgage from implementing certain evasions, structured transactions, and reciprocal arrangements. Prohibits a creditor from charging a consumer any fee to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high-cost mortgage, or to defer any payment due under such mortgage. Prohibits any fee for payoff statements other than a processing fee. Requires a creditor, as a prerequisite to extending consumer credit under a high-cost mortgage, to receive certification from a HUD-approved counselor that the consumer has received counseling on the advisability of the mortgage. Prescribes a procedure by which a high cost loan creditor or assignee that, acting in good faith, commits an unintentional violation of these prohibitions and other requirements may make timely corrections and avoid liability for the violation. Subtitle D: Office of Housing Counseling - Expand and Preserve Home Ownership Through Counseling Act - (Sec. 1442) Amends the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act to establish within HUD the Office of Housing Counseling, whose Director shall have primary responsibility for all activities and matters relating to both home ownership and rental housing counseling. (Sec. 1443) Amends the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 to require the HUD Secretary to: (1) prescribe counseling procedures for home ownership and rental counseling; and (2) provide for certification of computer software programs for consumers to evaluate different residential mortgage loan proposals. Requires the Director to: (1) develop and conduct national public service multimedia campaigns promoting housing counseling; and (2) use specified funds to conduct foreclosure rescue education programs, with emphasis upon retirement and low-income minority communities.

(Sec. 1452) Allocates specified funds to the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for activities to make borrowers who are delinquent on certain loans aware of the dangers of fraudulent activities associated with foreclosure. Subtitle E: Mortgage Servicing - (Sec. 1461) Amends TILA to require a creditor in a non-credit card consumer credit transaction secured by a first lien on the principal dwelling (other than a reverse mortgage) to establish an escrow or impound account for mandatory periodic payments or premiums (including taxes, insurance, and ground rents). Allows exemptions from this requirement for creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas and retain their mortgage originations in portfolio. Prohibits making an escrow or impound account a condition of a real property sale contract or a loan secured by a first deed of trust or mortgage on the consumer's principal dwelling unless specified circumstances exist. Requires such escrow or impound account to remain in existence for at least five years until sufficient equity exists so that private mortgage insurance is no longer required, or unless the underlying mortgage is terminated. States that: (1) escrow accounts need not be established for loans secured by shares in a cooperative; and (2) insurance premiums need not be included in escrow accounts for loans secured by condominium units if the condominium association has an obligation to unit owners to maintain a master insurance policy. Requires: (1) escrow accounts to be established in a federally insured depository institution or credit union; and (2) each creditor to pay interest on the amount held in such accounts as required by state or federal law. Requires specified consumer disclosures regarding a mandatory escrow or impound account before consummation of the credit transaction giving rise to such account. (Sec. 1462) Requires creditors to provide specified disclosures for consumers who waive escrow services. (Sec. 1463) Amends RESPA to prohibit the servicer of a federally related mortgage from engaging in certain practices, including obtaining force-placed hazard insurance, unless there is reason to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract requirements. (Force-placed hazard insurance is coverage obtained by the servicer when the borrower has failed to comply with hazard insurance requirements under the terms of the mortgage.) Prescribes notice and borrower non-response requirements for loan servicers to obtain force-placed insurance. Doubles the penalties for loan servicer noncompliance with RESPA disclosure requirements. Reduces from 20 days to 5 days the time limit within which loan servicers are required to respond to borrower inquiries. Requires any remaining escrow balance that is within the control of the loan servicer at the time the loan is paid off to be: (1) promptly returned to the borrower within 20 business days; or (2) credited to a similar account for a new mortgage loan to the borrower with the same lender. (Sec. 1464) Amends TILA to prohibit a loan servicer, except in a specified circumstance, from failing to credit a payment to the consumer's account as of the date of receipt. Requires a creditor or servicer of a home loan to send an accurate payoff balance no later than seven business days after receipt of a written request for it. (Sec. 1465) Requires repayment disclosures regarding a first mortgage- or lien-secured consumer credit transaction to take into account the amount of monthly escrow payments, including: (1) the taxable assessed value of the real property securing the transaction after consummation of the transaction, (2) the value of any improvements on the property or to be constructed on it, and (3) the replacement costs of the property for hazard insurance in the initial year after the transaction. Subtitle F: Appraisal Activities - (Sec. 1471) Amends TILA to set forth property appraisal requirements for a creditor who extends higher-risk mortgage credit to a consumer, including: (1) a written appraisal performed by a certified or licensed appraiser who conducts a physical property visit of the interior of the mortgaged property; (2) a free copy of such appraisal to the applicant before the transaction closing date; and (3) a statement by the creditor at the time of the initial mortgage application that the appraisal is for its sole use, and that the applicant, at its own expense, may choose to have a separate appraisal. Requires a creditor to obtain a second appraisal from a different certified or licensed appraiser if the purpose of a higher-risk mortgage (other than a HUD-insured reverse mortgage) is to finance the purchase or acquisition of the mortgaged property from a person within 180 days of the purchase or acquisition of such property by that person at a price lower than the current sale price of the property. (Sec. 1472)Prescribes appraisal independence requirements. Declares unlawful specified acts or practices that violate such requirements in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. Includes among unfair and deceptive practices any appraisal of a property offered as security in which a person with an interest in the underlying transaction compensates, coerces, extorts, colludes, instructs, induces, bribes, or intimidates a person conducting or involved in the appraisal. Includes, in addition, among such practices: (1) mischaracterizing, or suborning mischaracterization of, the appraised value of the property securing the extension of the credit; (2) seeking to influence an appraiser or otherwise to encourage a targeted value in order to facilitate the transaction; and (3) withholding or threatening to withhold timely payment for an appraisal report or for appraisal services rendered. Prohibits a certified or licensed appraiser or appraisal management company from having an interest, financial or otherwise, in the property or transaction involving the appraisal. Authorizes the Board, the CFPB, and designated federal agencies to jointly issue regulations addressing the issue of appraisal report portability, including regulations that ensure such portability between lenders for a consumer credit transaction secured by a 1-4 unit single family residence that is the principal dwelling of the consumer, or mortgage brokerage services for such a transaction. Subjects to civil penalties violations of appraisal independence requirements. Declares that the deference that a court accords to the CFPB with respect to its determination of the meaning or interpretation of any TILA provisions (except property appraisal requirements) shall be applied as if the CFPB were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer such provisions. (Sec. 1473) Amends the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to condition the establishment by a federal financial institutions regulatory agency and the Resolution Trust Corporation of a threshold level at or below which a certified or licensed appraiser is not required to perform appraisals in connection with federally related transactions on the agency's receiving concurrence from the CFPB that such threshold level provides reasonable protection for consumers who purchase 1-4 unit single-family residences. Directs the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to detail in its annual report to Congress: (1) the results of all audits of state appraiser regulatory agencies; and (2) an accounting of disapproved actions and warnings taken in the previous year, including the conditions causing the disapproval and the actions taken to achieve compliance. Requires Subcommittee meetings to be open to the public, but authorizes the closing of certain portions related to personnel and review of preliminary state audit reports. Requires the Subcommittee to: (1) monitor state requirements for the registration and supervision of an appraisal management company; and (2) maintain a national registry of appraisal management companies that either are registered with and subject to supervision of a state appraiser certifying and licensing agency or are operating subsidiaries of a federally regulated financial institution. Directs designated federal financial regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the CFPB, to jointly establish, by rule, minimum requirements a state must apply in the registration of appraisal management companies. Applies these same requirements to, and exempts from any state registration requirement, an appraisal management company that is a subsidiary owned and controlled by a financial institution and regulated by a federal financial institution regulatory age ncy. Sets forth: (1) registration limitations; (2) additional state agency reporting requirements; and (3) revised registry fees. Authorizes the Subcommittee to award grants to state appraiser certifying and licensing agencies in order to support their compliance with this Act. Requires the requirements for state licensing of an appraiser to meet or exceed the minimum cr iteria issued by the Appraisal Qualifications Board of The Appraisal Foundation for the licensing of real estate appraisers. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor whether each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency: (1) processes complaints and completes investigations in a reasonable time period; (2) appropriately disciplines sanctioned appraisers and appraisal management companies; (3) maintains an effective regulatory program; and (4) reports complaints and disciplinary actions on a timely basis to the national registries on appraisers and appraisal management companies. Authorizes the Subcommittee to: (1) remove a state licensed or certified appraiser or a registered appraisal management company from a national registry on an interim basis pending state agency action on licensing, certification, registration, and disciplinary proceedings; (2) impose sanctions against a state agency that fails to have an effective appraiser regulatory program; and (3) impose interim actions and suspensions against a state agency as an alternative to, or in advance of, derecognition of a state agency. Prohibits appraisal of a federally related transaction by a state- certified or -licensed appraiser unless the state appraiser certifying or licensing agency has in place a policy of issuing a reciprocal certification or license for an individual from another state who meets certain state licensure standards. Requires the Subcommittee to monitor each state appraiser certifying and licensing agency to determine whether: (1) its policies, practices, and procedures are consistent with maintaining appraiser independence; and (2) such state has effective regulations, and policies regarding the maintenance of appraiser independence. Requires the Subcommittee to establish and operate an Appraisal Complaint National Hotline, including a toll-free telephone number and an email address. Requires designated federal financial institution regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Subcommittee,to promulgate regulations to implement quality control standards governing automated valuation models (computerized models used by mortgage originators and secondary market issuers to determine the collateral worth of a mortgage secured by a consumer's principal dwelling). Prohibits the use of broker price opinions as the primary basis to evaluate property for loan origination in connection with a residential mortgage loan secured by such property. (Defines broker price opinion as an estimate prepared by a real estate broker, agent, or sales person that: (1) details the probable selling price of a particular piece of real estate property; and (2) provides a varying level of detail about the property's condition, market, and neighborhood, and information on comparable sales; but (3) does not include an automated valuation model.) Amends the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council Act of 1978 to require that at all times at least one member of the Appraisal Subcommittee have demonstrated knowledge and competence through licensure, certification, or professional designation within the appraisal profession. (Sec. 1474) Amends the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) to revise requirements that creditors provide loan applicants a copy of the appraisal report used in connection with the loan application secured by a lien on residential real property. Repeals the condition that the loan applicant request the copy. Requires a creditor to furnish the applicant with a copy of all written appraisals and valuations within three days after the closing of the loan. (Sec. 1475) Amends RESPA to permit the standard real estate settlement form to disclose, in the case of an appraisal coordinated by an appraisal management company, the fee paid directly by the company to the appraiser and the company's administration fee. (Sec. 1476) Instructs the Government Accountability Office to study : (1) the effectiveness and impact of certain appraisal methods, models, and distribution channels; (2) the Home Valuation Code of Conduct (HVCC); and (3) certain Appraisal Subcommittee functions, including its ability to monitor and enforce state and federal certification requirements and standards. Subtitle G: Mortgage Resolution and Modification - (Sec. 1481) Directs the HUD Secretary to develop a program to ensure protection of current and future tenants and at-risk multifamily properties. Denies persons convicted within the last 10 years of specified crimes involving a mortgage or real estate transaction any eligibility for mortgage assistance from the Making Home Affordable Program authorized or funded by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. (Sec. 1482) Instructs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the supplemental directives and other guidelines for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) of the Making Home Affordable initiative to require each mortgage servicer participating in HAMP to provide each borrower denied a mortgage modification with all borrower-related and mortgage-related input data used in any net present value (NPV) analyses performed in connection with the mortgage. Directs the Secretary to establish a public website that provides: (1) a calculator for NPV analyses of a mortgage, based on the Secretary's methodology for calculating such value, that mortgagors can use to enter information regarding their own mortgages; and (2) a determination after entering such information of whether such mortgage would be accepted or rejected for modification under the Program. (Sec. 1483) Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to revise the HAMP guidelines to make public the data being collected from each participating mortgage servicer and lender. (Sec. 1484) Amends the Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act with respect to the requirement that any immediate successor in interest in residential real property pursuant to foreclosure of a federally-related mortgage loan assume that interest subject to certain conditions. Deems the date of a notice of such a foreclosure to be the date upon which complete title to a property is transferred to a successor entity or person as a result of a court order or pursuant to provisions in a mortgage, deed of trust, or security deed. Subtitle H: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1491) Expresses the sense of Congress that efforts to enhance the terms of residential mortgage credit and practices would be incomplete without enactment of meaningful structural reforms of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). (Sec. 1492) Directs the Comptroller General to study certain interagency efforts to crackdown on mortgage foreclosure rescue scams and loan modification fraud in order to advise Congress on the risks and vulnerabilities of emerging schemes in the loan modification arena. (Sec. 1493) Amends the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 to require each state to report certain mortgage data. (Sec. 1494) Directs the HUD Secretary to study the effect upon residential mortgage loan foreclosures of: (1) the presence of drywall imported from China between 2004 and the end of 2007; and (2) the availability of property insurance for residential structures in which such drywall is present. (Sec. 1496) Makes necessary sums available to the HUD Secretary to: (1) provide $1 billion in emergency mortgage assistance through the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Fund for such purpose. Amends the Emergency Housing Act of 1975 to permit emergency mortgage assistance if the mortgagor has incurred a substantial reduction in income as a result of involuntary unemployment or underemployment due to medical conditions. Revises requirements for emergency mortgage assistance to replace the maximum amount of $250 per month with an amount determined reasonably necessary to supplement what the homeowner is capable of contributing toward the mortgage payment. Caps the aggregate amount of such assistance to any homeowner at $50,000. Makes the interest rate fixed for the life of an insured loan or credit advance. Limits the interest rate to that generally charged for HUD-insured mortgages on single-family housing. Prohibits the charging of any interest on deferred interest on such a loan or credit advance. Requires the Secretary, in establishing rates, terms, and conditions for loans or advances of credit, to take into account a homeowner's ability to repay such loan or credit advance. Authorizes any eligible homeowner who receives such a grant or credit advance to repay the loan in full, without penalty, by lump sum or by installment payments at any time before it becomes due and payable. Repeals the 40% cap on the total amount of loans and credit advances by a financial institution that may be insured, and the 90% cap on the payment of any single loss claim that may be paid out. Increases from $1.5 billion to $3 billion the cap on the aggregate amount of insured loans and advances, but includes emergency mortgage relief payments in such amount. Directs the Secretary to establish underwriting guidelines or procedures to allocate amounts made available for incurred loans and advances and for emergency relief payments, based on the likelihood that a mortgagor will be able to resume mortgage payments. Repeals the authorization of appropriations for the emergency mortgage relief program, but extends through FY2011 the authority to insure loans and credit advances under the program and to make emergency mortgage relief payments. Repeals the authority of each federal supervisory agency to waive or relax limitations pertaining to their operations with respect to mortgage delinquencies in order to cause or encourage forebearance in residential mortgage loan foreclosures. Repeals certain reporting requirements as well as the authority of the FDIC to make credit advances to insured banks to facilitate their participation in the emergency mortgage relief program. (Sec. 1497) Makes $1 billion available to the HUD Secretary for assistance to state and local governments for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed homes. (Sec. 1498) Directs the HUD Secretary to establish a grants program to provide a full range of foreclosure legal assistance to low- and moderate-income homeowners and tenants related to home ownership preservation, home foreclosure prevention, and tenancy associated with home foreclosure. Authorizes appropriations for FY2009-FY2012. Title XV: Miscellaneous Provisions - (Sec. 1501) Amends the Bretton Woods Agreements Act to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Director at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to: (1) evaluate, before consideration by the IMF Board of Executive Directors, any proposal to make a loan to a country whose public debt exceeds its gross domestic product if that country is not eligible for assistance from the International Development Association; and (2) oppose the proposal if such evaluation indicates the proposed loan is unlikely to be repaid in full. Directs the Secretary to assess annually to Congress the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full. (Sec. 1502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the eastern DRC , particularly sexual- and gender-based violence, and contributes to an emergency humanitarian situation therein, warranting certain disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to issue regulations requiring persons for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that person to make annual disclosures of whether any such conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country. Requires the report, regarding any minerals that did originate in the DRC or an adjoining country, to describe: (1) due diligence measures taken on the source and chain of custody of such minerals; and (2) the products manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, that are not DRC conflict free. Defines \"DRC conflict free\" as products that do not contain minerals that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the DRC or an adjoining country. Instructs the Secretary of State to: (1) submit to Congress a strategy to address the linkages between human rights abuses, armed groups, mining of conflict minerals, and commercial products; (2) produce and update periodically a map, available to the public, of mineral-rich zones, trade routes, and areas under the control of armed groups in the DRC and adjoining countries (\"Conflict Minerals Map\"); and (3) publish in the Federal Register a notice of intent to declare a mineral a conflict mineral. Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the rate of sexual- and gender-based violence in war-torn areas of the DRC and adjoining countries; and (2) the effectiveness of these newly required reports in promoting peace and security in such countries. Requires the Secretary of Commerce to assess for Congress the accuracy of independent private sector audits and other due diligence processes. (Sec. 1503) Requires securities issuers required to report to the SEC that are coal or other mine operators, or that have subsidiaries that are mine operators, to include in periodic reports to the SEC, among other things, the total number per mine of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to the cause and effect of a mine safety or health hazard for which the operator received a citation from the Mine Safety and Health Administration. Requires reports, also, of imminent danger orders and written notices of patterns of violations of such standards, or the potential to have such a pattern. (Sec. 1504) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to: (1) promulgate final rules requiring each resource extraction issuer to include in its annual report information, in an interactive data format, detailing any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary, or an entity under its control to a foreign government or the federal government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals; and (2) make a compilation of such information publicly accessible online. Authorizes appropriations. (Sec. 1505) Directs the Comptroller General to assess for Congress: (1) the relative independence, effectiveness, and expertise of presidentially appointed inspectors general and inspectors general of designated federal entities; and (2) the effects on independence of the amendments to the Inspector General Act of 1978 made by this Act. (Sec. 1506) Directs the FDIC to evaluate for Congress: (1) the definition of core deposits for the purpose of calculating the insurance premiums of banks; (2) the potential impact on the Deposit Insurance Fund of revising the definitions of brokered deposits and core deposits to better distinguish between them; (3) the differences between core deposits and brokered deposits and their role in the economy and the domestic banking sector; (4) the potential stimulative effect on local economies of redefining core deposits; and (5) the competitive parity between large institutions and community banks that could result from redefining core deposits. Title XVI: Section 1256 Contracts - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exclude from the definition of a Section 1256 contract any interest rate swap, currency swap, basis swap, interest rate cap, interest rate floor, commodity swap, equity swap, equity index swap, credit default swap, or similar agreement. (Thus shields such instruments from treatment as sold for its fair market value [marked to market] on the last business day of the taxable year for capital gains or loss taxation purposes).",

(Current law makes no reference to an employer's affirmative and bona fide effort.) Provides that an employer's accommodation of an employee's practice of wearing religious clothing or a religious hairstyle, or of taking time off for a religious reason, imposes an undue hardship on the conduct of an employer's business in accommodating such practice only if the accommodation imposes a significant difficulty or expense on the conduct of the employer's business when considered in light of specified factors set forth in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, including: (1) the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, (2) the financial resources and size of the business, and (3) the type of operation of the business.

Defines \"sex-selection abortion\" as an abortion undertaken to eliminate an unborn child based on the sex or gender of the child. Excludes from the definition of \"abortion\" actions taken to terminate a pregnancy if the intent is to save the life or preserve the health of the unborn child, remove a dead unborn child caused by spontaneous abortion, or remove an ectopic pregnancy. Authorizes civil actions, for verifiable money damages for injuries and punitive damages, by: (1) fathers, or maternal grandparents if the mother is an unemancipated minor, of unborn children who are the subject of an abortion performed or attempted through any of the above violations; and (2) women upon whom an abortion has been performed with a knowing or attempted use of force or threat of force to intentionally injure or intimidate any person for the purpose of coercing a sex-selection abortion.

Requires that priority be given to a preliminary investigation of any charge that, while employees were seeking representation by a labor organization, or during the period after a labor organization was recognized as a representative, but before the first collective bargaining contract is entered into, an employer: (1) discharged or otherwise discriminated against an employee to encourage or discourage membership in the labor organization; (2) threatened to discharge or to otherwise discriminate against an employee in order to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of guaranteed self-organization or collective bargaining rights; or (3) engaged in any other related ULP that significantly interferes with, restrains, or coerces employees in the exercise of such guaranteed rights. Adds to remedies for such violations: (1) back pay plus double liquidated damages; and (2) additional civil penalties. Requires an employer, within 30 days after the National Labor Relations Board orders an election, to: (1) notify the designated representative of activities the employer intends to engage in to oppose recognition; and (2) provide such representative with equal access to the place of employment to campaign in favor of such recognition.

(Sec. 112) Requires the Council, among other things, to: (1) identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (2) promote market discipline, by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of such companies that the Government will shield them from losses in the event of failure; (3) respond to emerging threats to the stability of the financial system. Includes among the Council's duties: (1) identifying gaps in regulation that could pose risks to U.S. financial stability; (2) requiring supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve Board) for nonbank financial companies that may pose risks to U.S. financial stability in the event of their material financial distress or failure, or because of specified activities; (3) making recommendations to the Board concerning the establishment of heightened prudential standards for risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity, contingent capital, and overall risk management for nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies supervised by the Board; and (4) identifying systemically important financial market utilities and payment, clearing, and settlement activities. (Sec. 113) Authorizes the Council to determine that a foreign or a U.S. nonbank financial company shall be supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to prudential standards under this Act, if the Council determines that material financial distress, or activities at the company, could threaten U.S. financial stability. Authorizes the company, upon the Council's determination, to establish an intermediate holding company in which its financial activities (and those of its subsidiaries) are conducted in compliance with Board regulations or guidance. Subjects such intermediate holding company to Board supervision and to prudential standards under this Act as if it were a nonbank financial company supervised by the Board. Restricts Board supervision to the company's financial activities only. Requires the Council, in exercising its duties with respect to foreign nonbank financial companies, foreign-based bank holding companies, and cross-border activities and markets, to consult with appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. (Sec. 114) Requires any nonbank financial company determined to come under Board supervision to register with the Federal Reserve Board. (Sec. 115) Authorizes the Council to recommend to the Board prudential standards and reporting and disclosure requirements for Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies that: (1) are more stringent than those for other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the U.S. financial stability; and (2) increase in stringency, based upon specified considerations. Requires the Council to study and report to Congress on the feasibility, benefits, costs, and structure of a contingent capital requirement for Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies. Authorizes the Council to make recommendations to the Board about Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and large, interconnected bank holding companies, including: (1) required periodic reports on company plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure; (2) company credit exposure; (3) standards to limit risks posed by failure of any individual company to other companies; and (3) short-term company debt limits. (Sec. 116) Authorizes the Council, acting through the Office of Financial Research, to require a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or a Board-supervised nonbank financial company (and subsidiaries) to submit certified reports of condition and risk management systems. (Sec. 117) Treats as a Board-supervised nonbank financial company any entity that: (1) was a bank holding company having total consolidated assets 50 billion or more as of January 1, 2010; (2) received financial assistance under or participated in the Capital Purchase Program established under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA); or (3) is a successor entity. Prescribes a procedure for appeal from such treatment. (Sec. 118) Treats Council expenses as expenses of, and paid by, the Office of Financial Research. (Sec. 119) Prescribes procedures for resolution by the Council of supervisory jurisdictional disputes among member agencies. (Sec. 120) Authorizes the Council, in specified circumstances, to provide for more stringent regulation of a financial activity by issuing recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies to apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for a financial activity or practice conducted by bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies. Requires such primary agencies to impose the standards recommended by the Council. (Sec. 121) Requires the Federal Reserve Board to take mitigatory actions restricting the activities of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, or Board-supervised nonbank financial companies, which pose a grave threat to U.S. financial stability, including: (1) limiting the company's ability to become affiliated with another company; (2) restricting the company's ability to offer a financial product or products; (3) requiring the company to terminate one or more activities; (4) imposing conditions on the manner in which the company conducts activities; or (5) requiring the company to transfer assets or off-balance-sheet items to unaffiliated entities. (Sec. 122) Authorizes the Comptroller General to audit Council activities. (Sec. 123) Instructs the Council Chairperson to study and report to Congress on the economic impact of possible financial services regulatory limitations intended to reduce systemic risk. Subtitle B: Office of Financial Research - (Sec. 152) Establishes within the Department of the Treasury the Office of Financial Research (OFR) to support the Council and member agencies in: (1) collecting and standardizing data collections; (2) performing applied research and essential long-term research; and (3) developing risk measurement and monitoring tools. (Sec. 154) Establishes the Data Center and the Research and Analysis Center to carry out OFR programmatic responsibilities. (Sec. 155) Establishes the Financial Research Fund in the Treasury as depository for funds and assessments designated for the OFR. Subtitle C: Additional Board of Governors Authority for Certain Nonbank Financial Companies and Bank Holding Companies - (Sec. 161) Authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to require a nonbank financial company under its supervision (and any subsidiary) to report under oath regarding its financial condition, its systems for monitoring and controlling risks, and the extent to which its activities and operations threaten U.S. financial stability. Authorizes the Board to examine such companies regarding such matters. (Sec. 162) Subjects a Board-supervised nonbank financial company (and any subsidiaries that are not depository institutions) to specified enforcement proceedings of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) in the same manner and to the same extent as if it were a bank holding company. Authorizes the Board to recommend that primary financial regulatory agency initiate supervisory actions or enforcement proceedings against noncompliant depository institution or functionally regulated subsidiaries. (Sec. 163) Treats a Board-supervised nonbank financial company as a statutory bank holding company for purposes of requirements governing bank acquisitions. Requires a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or a Board-supervised nonbank financial company to notify the Board in writing in advance of any transaction in which it acquires direct or indirect ownership or control of voting shares of a company (other than an insured depository institution) which: (1) has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more; and (2) is engaged in specified activities under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. (Sec. 164) Treats a Board-supervised nonbank financial company as a bank holding company for purposes of the Depository Institutions Management Interlocks Act. Prohibits the Board, however, from permitting service by a management official of a Board-supervised nonbank financial company as a management official of any bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, or any other Board-supervised nonaffiliated nonbank financial company (except to provide a temporary exemption for interlocks resulting from a merger, acquisition, or consolidation). (Sec. 165) Requires the Board to establish, for Board-supervised nonbank financial companies and for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, prudential standards addressing specified requirements that: (1) are more stringent than those for other nonbank financial companies and bank holding companies that do not present similar risks to the U.S. financial stability; and (2) increase in stringency, based upon specified considerations. Authorizes the Board to require each Board-supervised nonbank financial company and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to maintain a minimum amount of contingent capital convertible to equity in times of financial stress. Directs the Board to require each Board-supervised nonbank financial company and such bank holding companies to report periodically: (1) their plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure; and (2) the nature and extent of their credit exposure. Requires the Board to prescribe standards limiting the risks and credit exposure that failure of any individual company could pose to a Board-supervised nonbank financial company or to a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. Requires such regulations to prohibit credit exposure exceeding 25% of a company's capital stock and surplus (or a lower amount, if necessary). Authorizes the Board to prescribe a limit on the amount of short-term debt, including off-balance sheet exposures, that may be accumulated by bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more or Board-supervised nonbank financial companies. Directs the Board to require each publicly-traded Board-supervised nonbank financial company to establish a risk committee responsible for the oversight of the enterprise-wide risk management practices.

(Sec. 934) Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to require each NRSRO to refer to the appropriate law enforcement or regulatory authorities any information that it receives from a third party and finds credible that alleges that an issuer of securities rated by the NRSRO has committed or is committing a material violation of law that has not been adjudicated by a federal or state court. (Sec. 935) Requires an NRSRO, in producing a credit rating, to consider information which it finds credible that it has, or receives about an issuer from a source other than the issuer or underwriter, and which it finds potentially significant to a rating decision. (Sec. 936) Directs the SEC to: (1) prescribe qualification standards to ensure the accuracy of securities ratings issued by credit rating analysts; (2) require each NRSRO to establish and enforce written policies and procedures that assess the probability that an issuer of a security or money market instrument will fail to make payments to investors in accordance with the terms of such instrument; and ( 3) define clearly and disclose the meaning of any symbol used by the NRSRO to denote a credit rating, and apply it in a consistent manner for all types of instruments for which it is used.

(Sec. 1472)Prescribes appraisal independence requirements. Declares unlawful specified acts or practices that violate such requirements in connection with a consumer credit transaction secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. Includes among unfair and deceptive practices any appraisal of a property offered as security in which a person with an interest in the underlying transaction compensates, coerces, extorts, colludes, instructs, induces, bribes, or intimidates a person conducting or involved in the appraisal.

Directs the Secretary to assess annually to Congress the likelihood that loans made pursuant to such proposals will be repaid in full. (Sec. 1502) Expresses the sense of Congress that the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) helps finance conflict characterized by extreme levels of violence in the eastern DRC , particularly sexual- and gender-based violence, and contributes to an emergency humanitarian situation therein, warranting certain disclosures under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to direct the SEC to issue regulations requiring persons for which conflict minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by that person to make annual disclosures of whether any such conflict minerals originated in the DRC or an adjoining country.

Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide that the granting of a preference to a member of an Indian tribe by the tribe on account of such membership is not a violation of the prohibition against discrimination under federally assisted programs on the ground of a person's race, color, or national origin. Allows Indian tribes and tribal organizations to submit proposals to have assistance from more than one federal program integrated to support a community, economic, or business development project that is consistent with the goals of those programs. Requires the federal agency most affected by such a proposal to consult with the other agencies involved and the Department of the Interior in deciding whether or not to approve the proposal and facilitate its implementation. Authorizes federal agencies to enter into agreements with states for joint financing of such projects.",

          "text": "(This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on June 9, 2016. The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nPuerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act or PROMESA \n\nThis bill addresses Puerto Rico's debt by establishing an oversight board, a process for restructuring debt, and expedited procedures for approving critical infrastructure projects.\n\n(Sec. 2) The effective date of this bill is the date of enactment. Title III (Adjustments of Debts) only applies to cases commenced under it on or after the date of enactment. Titles III and VI (Creditor Collective Action) apply to all debts, claims, and liens, regardless of the creation date.\n\n(Sec. 3) If any provision of the bill is held invalid, the remainder of the bill is not affected. Title III is not severable from Title I (Establishment and Organization of Oversight Board) and Title II (Responsibilities of Oversight Board), and Titles I and II are not severable from Title III.\n\n(Sec. 4) This bill prevails over any provision of territory law, state law, or regulation that is inconsistent with this bill. (The territories referred to in this bill include Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.)\n\n(Sec. 5) This section defines terms used in this bill.\n\n(Sec. 6) This section specifies where the bill should be placed in the U.S. Code.\n\n(Sec. 7) Nothing in the bill should be construed as impairing or relieving a territorial government or instrumentality from compliance with federal laws or requirements or territorial laws and requirements implementing a federally authorized or federally delegated program protecting the health, safety, or environment of persons in the territory.\n\nTITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT AND ORGANIZATION OF OVERSIGHT BOARD\n\n(Sec. 101) This section establishes a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico. The purpose of the board is to provide a method for a covered territory to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets. The board must be created as an entity within the territorial government for which it is established and must not be considered to be a part of the federal government.\n\nThis section provides the board with authority to oversee territorial instrumentalities. The bill specifies that a territorial instrumentality is any political subdivision, public agency, instrumentality, or public corporation of a territory, and that term should be broadly construed to effectuate the purposes of the bill.\n\nThe board may require instrumentalities to establish fiscal plans and budgets in accordance with this bill. The board may also require the governor to submit reports regarding instrumentalities and include the budgets of certain instrumentalities in the territory budget.\n\nThis section sets forth procedures and requirements for the board regarding:\n\n the appointment and qualifications of members of the board, designating a chair, terms of service, and filling vacancies. This section also specifies procedures for adopting bylaws for conducting the business of the board. An affirmative vote of the majority of the board is required to approve a fiscal plan or a budget, cause legislative acts not to be enforced, or approve or disapprove an infrastructure project as a critical project.\n\nThe governor of a territory or a designee is an ex officio member of the board without voting rights. With the approval of a majority of its members, the board may conduct its business in an executive session that is closed to the public and consists solely of voting members and any professionals that the board determines to be necessary.\n\n(Sec. 102) The board must have an office in the covered territory and additional offices as it deems necessary. Federal agencies may provide facilities and equipment for the board.\n\n(Sec. 103) The board may hire an executive director and staff. Federal agencies and territorial governments may detail employees to the board. The executive director and staff of the board may be appointed and paid without regard to territorial or federal laws governing appointments and salaries. The board is exempt from procurement laws of the covered territory.\n\n(Sec. 104) The powers of the board include:\n\n holding hearings and sessions to take testimony and receive evidence; obtaining official data from the territorial and federal government; obtaining creditor information; accepting gifts, bequests, and devises of services or property; issuing subpoenas; entering into contracts; enforcing territorial laws prohibiting public sector employees from participating in a strike or lockout; certifying voluntary agreements between creditors and debtors; protecting certain preexisting voluntary restructuring agreements; filing a petition to restructure or to submit or modify a plan of adjustment on behalf of a debtor; seeking judicial enforcement of its authority; imposing penalties for violations of valid orders of the board; ensuring prompt and efficient payment of taxes through electronic reporting, payment, and auditing technologies; requesting administrative support services from federal agencies; and investigating the disclosure and selling practices in connection with the purchase of bonds issued by a covered territory. (Sec. 105) The board, its members, and its staff are exempt from liability resulting from actions taken to implement this bill.\n\n(Sec. 106) Except for actions arising out of Title III or out of the board's issuance of a subpoena, any action arising out of this bill must be brought in the U.S. district court for the covered territory or the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii if the territory does not have a district court. The bill sets forth requirements for appeal, the timing of relief, and expedited consideration for matters relating to this bill. The U.S. district court does not have jurisdiction to review challenges to the board's certification determinations.\n\n(Sec. 107) The board must submit an annual budget to the President, Congress, and the territory's governor and legislature. The territorial government must provide specified initial funding for the board and designate a dedicated funding source for the board that is not subject to subsequent legislative appropriations.\n\n(Sec. 108) The territorial government may not exercise control over the board or enact, implement, or enforce any legislation, policy, or rule that would impair the purposes of this bill.\n\n(Sec. 109 The members and staff of the board are subject to federal conflict of interest and financial disclosure requirements.\n\nTITLE II--RESPONSIBILITIES OF OVERSIGHT BOARD\n\nThis title establishes the process for the submission, approval, and certification of fiscal plans and budgets for Puerto Rico and its territorial instrumentalities.\n\n(Sec. 201) The board must provide the governor of the territory with a schedule for the process of development, submission, approval, and certification of fiscal plans. A plan must cover a period of at least five years and provide a method to achieve fiscal responsibility and access to the capital markets.\n\nThe fiscal plan must:\n\n provide specified estimates, forecasts, and analysis of revenues, expenditures, and debt; ensure the funding of essential public services; provide adequate funding for public pension systems; provide for the elimination of structural deficits; provide for a debt burden that is sustainable in years in which a stay under this bill is not in effect; improve fiscal governance, accountability, and internal controls; enable the achievement of fiscal targets; provide for capital expenditures and investments necessary to promote economic growth; adopt appropriate recommendations submitted by the board; include additional information the board deems necessary; prevent certain transfers or loans of assets, resources, or funds of a territorial instrumentality; and respect lawful priorities and liens in effect prior to the enactment of this bill. This section establishes procedures for the review, approval, and certification of the fiscal plan by the board. If the governor fails to submit a fiscal plan that satisfies the requirements, the board may develop and submit the fiscal plan to the governor and legislature. The governor and board may also work collaboratively to develop a fiscal plan.\n\n(Sec. 202) The board must submit to the governor and legislature revenue forecasts and a schedule for developing, submitting, approving, and certifying budgets. The budget must be developed in accordance with the fiscal plan and certified by the board. If the governor and legislature fail to develop certifiable budgets within the established deadline, the board must develop the budget for the territory or territorial instrumentality for that fiscal year. The board, the governor, and the legislature may also work collaboratively to develop a budget.\n\n(Sec. 203) The governor must submit to the board quarterly reports including the actual revenues, expenditures, and cash flow of the territorial government. If the data is inconsistent with the certified budget, the board must notify the governor and provide the territorial government with an opportunity to explain or correct the inconsistency. If the government fails to correct the inconsistency within an established timeframe, the board must make budget reductions to ensure the quarterly budget aligns with the certified budget.\n\n(Sec. 204) The governor must submit each enacted territorial law to the board with a cost estimate and a certification that the law is consistent with the fiscal plan. If the law is inconsistent with the plan or is missing a cost estimate, the board may take such actions as it considers necessary, including preventing the enforcement or application of the law.\n\nThe board must work with the territorial government to promote compliance with laws that require agencies and instrumentalities of the territorial government to maintain a registry of all contracts executed. The board may establish policies to require prior board approval of certain contracts, executive orders, rules, and regulations.\n\nA territory may not enact new laws authorizing budgetary transfers between instrumentalities during the time between the enactment of this bill and the appointment of the board. Transfers that occur during this period are subject to review and reversal by the board.\n\n Upon appointment of its members, the board may review and, in its discretion, rescind certain territorial laws that were enacted during specified time periods and alter pre-existing priorities of creditors in a manner outside the ordinary course of business or inconsistent with the territory's constitution or laws as of specified dates.\n\nThe board may not impede territorial actions taken to implement certain federal programs, requirements, and standards.\n\n(Sec. 205) The board may submit recommendations to the governor or the legislature for actions to ensure compliance with the fiscal plan, or to otherwise promote the financial stability, economic growth, management responsibility, and service delivery efficiency of the territorial government. The governor or legislature must notify the board as to whether it will adopt the recommendations, provide an implementation plan for recommendations that will be adopted, and provide an explanation for the recommendations that will not be adopted.\n\n(Sec. 206) Prior to issuing a debt restructuring certification regarding an entity, the board must determine that:\n\n the entity has made good-faith efforts to reach a consensual restructuring with creditors; the entity has adopted procedures necessary to deliver timely audited financial statements, and made public draft financial statements and other information sufficient for any interested person to make an informed decision with respect to a possible restructuring; a fiscal plan certified by the board is in place; and either no order approving a qualifying modification has been entered into or an order has been entered into and the entity is unable to make its debt payments notwithstanding the modification. (Sec. 207) A territorial government may not issue debt, guarantee debt, or enter into other transactions with respect to its debt without the approval of the board.\n\n (Sec. 208) The board must submit to the President, Congress, the governor, and the legislature annual reports that describe the progress the territorial government has made in meeting the objectives of the bill, the assistance provided by the board to the territorial government, recommendation for changes to federal laws, the use of funds by the board, and any other activities the board deems necessary. The board must also submit specified reports regarding discretionary tax abatement agreements and cash flow.\n\n(Sec. 209) The board terminates when it certifies that: (1) the territorial government has adequate access to short- and long- term credit markets at reasonable rates to meet its borrowing needs; and (2) for at least four consecutive years, the government has developed its budgets using modified accrual accounting standards and has achieved balanced budgets.\n\n(Sec. 210) The full faith and credit of the United States is not pledged for any bond issued by the covered territory while an oversight board is in effect. Any claim to which the United States is determined to be liable is subject to the appropriations process. No federal funds are authorized by this bill for the payment of any liability of the territorial government.\n\n(Sec. 211) If the board determines that a pension system of the territorial government is materially underfunded, the board must conduct an analysis prepared by an independent actuary of the pension system to assist the board in evaluating the fiscal and economic impact of the pension cash flows.\n\n(Sec. 212) The board may intervene in any litigation filed against the territorial government and seek injunctive relief, including a stay of litigation.\n\nTITLE III--ADJUSTMENTS OF DEBTS\n\nThis title establishes a process for the adjustment of debts by a territorial government or an instrumentality of a territorial government.\n\n(Sec. 301) This section makes specified sections from the federal bankruptcy code applicable to this title and defines terms.\n\n(Sec. 302) A territory or territorial instrumentality is eligible to be a debtor under this title if it is subject to an oversight board and has been certified by the board.\n\n(Sec. 303) Subject to the limitations set forth in Titles I and II, this title does not prohibit a territory from exercising political and governmental powers over itself and its instrumentalities. This section prohibits territorial laws prescribing a method of composition or moratorium on the indebtedness of the territory or its instrumentalities to a non-consenting creditor. It also preempts unlawful executive orders that: (1) alter, amend, or modify the rights of holders of debt; or (2) divert funds from a territorial instrumentality to either the territory or another territorial instrumentality.\n\n(Sec. 304) The board may initiate a proceeding to restructure the debt of an entity by filing a petition in district court. The filing of a petition constitutes an order for relief. This section permits the joint filing of petitions for debtors if the debtors are affiliated and provides for joint administration of affiliated debtor cases.\n\n(Sec. 305) Unless the board consents or the actions are permitted in the plan of adjustment, a court may not interfere with the political or governmental powers of the debtor, the property or revenues of the debtor, or the use or enjoyment by the debtor of any income-producing property.\n\n(Sec. 306) This section establishes original and exclusive jurisdiction for any case under Title III of this bill with the federal district courts, subject to specified exceptions. The courts may oversee any additional claim or civil cause of action in which the party is involved for which the overseeing court has jurisdiction. The section also establishes procedures and requirements for removal, remands, transfers, and appeals.\n\n(Sec. 307) Venue for restructuring under this title is the federal district court for the covered territory (or territorial instrumentality) or the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii if a territory does not have a district court. Subject to the discretion of the board, venue for the case may also be the district court for the jurisdiction in which the board maintains an office that is located outside of the territory.\n\n(Sec. 308) The Chief Justice of the United States must designate a district court judge to preside over the case if the debtor is a territory. For cases in which the territory is not a debtor, the chief judge of the court of appeals must designate a district court judge to conduct the case.\n\n(Sec. 309) A district court may abstain in the interests of justice from hearing a particular proceeding arising in or related to a case under this title.\n\n(Sec. 310) The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure apply to a case under this title and related civil proceedings.\n\n(Sec. 311) This section exempts a lease to a territory from being treated as an executory contract or unexpired lease solely because the lease is subject to termination for failure of a debtor to appropriate rent.\n\n(Sec. 312) This section specifies that only the board may file a plan of adjustment of the debts of the debtor once it has issued a certification.\n\n(Sec. 313) The board may change or modify a plan of adjustment before the plan is confirmed, as long as the modification meets the requirement of this title.\n\n(Sec. 314) A special taxpayer may object to confirmation of a plan. (Under current law, a special taxpayer is a record owner or holder of title to real property against which a special assessment or special tax has been levied the proceeds of which are the sole source of payment of an obligation issued by the debtor to defray the cost of an improvement relating to the real property.)\n\nA court must confirm the plan if:\n\n the plan complies with the applicable provisions of the federal bankruptcy code and this title; the debtor is not legally prohibited from undertaking any actions necessary to carry out the plan; the holders of claims will receive cash equal to the allowed amount of the claim unless there is another agreement; any necessary legislative, regulatory, or electoral approvals necessary to carry out a provision of the plan have been obtained or the provision is conditioned on the approval; the plan is feasible and in the best interest of the creditors; and the plan is consistent with the fiscal plan certified by the board. (Sec. 315) This section designates the board as the representative of the debtor and authorizes the board to take any action necessary on behalf of the debtor including the filing of a petition, submitting or modifying a plan of adjustment, or submitting other filings with the court.\n\n(Sec. 316) The court may authorize reasonable payments to professionals connected with a Title III proceeding.\n\n(Sec. 317) A court may permit payment to professionals while the Title III case is pending.\n\nTITLE IV--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\n(Sec. 401) Nothing in the bill is intended to: limit the authority of Congress over the territories; authorize the issuance of subpoenas by the board to judicial officers or employees of territorial courts; or to alter, amend, or abrogate agreements, treaties, or covenants affecting the Northern Mariana Islands or American Samoa.\n\n(Sec. 402) Nothing in this bill restricts Puerto Rico's right to determine its future political status, including by conducting the plebiscite authorized under current law.\n\n(Sec. 403) The bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to permit the governor of Puerto Rico, subject to the approval of the board, to set a minimum wage less than the federal minimum wage for employees who are under the age of 25 and hired after the enactment of this bill for a period of up to four years or until the termination of the board.\n\n(Sec. 404) This section exempts Puerto Rico from Department of Labor regulations published on July 6, 2015, regarding overtime pay for executive, administrative, professional, outside sales, and computer employees, until: (1) Government Accountability Office (GAO) assesses the impact of applying the regulations to Puerto Rico, and (2) Labor certifies that the rule will not have a negative impact on the economy of Puerto Rico.\n\n(Sec. 405) This section automatically stays all litigation against Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities, as well as any other judicial, administrative or other action or proceedings to enforce or collect claims until the later of six months after the date of enactment or February 15, 2017, subject to specified extensions which may be approved by the board or the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.\n\nA district court may grant relief from the stay for parties subject to irreparable damage because of the imposition of the stay. The stay does not authorize the government of Puerto Rico to stop payments on any liability. If the board determines it is feasible, the government must continue to make scheduled interest payments during the stay.\n\n(Sec. 406) This bill amends the Omnibus Insular Areas Act of 1992 to permit the government of Puerto Rico to make purchases through the General Services Administration.\n\n(Sec. 407) Upon the conclusion of the stay, creditors may sue if the government of Puerto Rico transfers property encumbered by liens or security interests between instrumentalities during the tenure of the board in violation of any agreement or applicable law.\n\n(Sec. 408) The GAO must report to Congress on the application and utilization of Small Business Administration (SBA) contracting activities (including contracting activities relating to the SBA's Historically Underutilized Business Zone Empowerment Contracting [HUBZone] program in Puerto Rico).\n\n(Sec. 409) This section establishes within the legislative branch a Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico to submit a specified report to Congress.\n\n(Sec. 410) The GAO must submit to Congress a report describing the conditions that led to the level of debt per capita, how the actions of the territorial government improved or impaired the territory's financial conditions, and recommendations to avert future indebtedness of territories and states.\n\n(Sec. 411) The GAO must report to Congress on the public debt of each territory, and the government of each territory must provide the GAO with any materials necessary to carry out this section.\n\n(Sec. 412) This section amends the Small Business Act to exempt Puerto Rico from the 20% population cap that applies to the designation of qualified census tracts in Puerto Rico's metropolitan statistical areas under the SBA HUBZone program. The exemption applies until the earlier of ten years after the SBA begins implementing it, or the date on which the oversight board ceases to exist.\n\nThe SBA must develop and implement criteria and guidance on using a risk-based approach to requesting and verifying information from entities applying to be designated or recertified as qualified HUBZone small business concerns. The GAO must assess the SBA's criteria and guidance.\n\n(Sec. 413) Nothing in this bill may be interpreted to restrict: (1) the ability of the Puerto Rico Commission for the Comprehensive Audit of the Public Credit to file its reports, or (2) the review and consideration of the commission's findings by Puerto Rico's government or the oversight board.\n\nTITLE V--PUERTO RICO INFRASTRUCTURE REVITALIZATION\n\nThis title establishes a process to provide an expedited permitting and review process for certain infrastructure projects in Puerto Rico.\n\n(Sec. 501) This section provides definitions for terms commonly used in Title V of this bill.\n\n(Sec. 502) This section establishes the position of Revitalization Coordinator under the board. The bill requires the governor to appoint the Revitalization Coordinator based on nominations submitted by the board.\n\n(Sec. 503) The Revitalization Coordinator may recommend to the board projects to be designated as critical projects. To be considered as a critical project, a project sponsor must submit to the Revitalization Coordinator an application including:\n\n the impact the project will have on an emergency, the availability of immediate private capital, the cost of the project and the amount of government funds needed, the environmental and economic benefits, the status of the project if it is existing or ongoing, and any additional criteria the Revitalization Coordinator may require. The Revitalization Coordinator may require additional details for energy projects. Critical projects approved by the oversight board are eligible for an expedited permitting and review process.\n\n(Sec. 504) This section establishes the Interagency Environmental Subcommittee to evaluate environmental documents required under Puerto Rico law for any critical project within the expedited permitting process established by the Revitalization Coordinator pursuant to this bill.\n\nPuerto Rico's legislature and governor may not hinder the expedited permitting process authorized under this bill. Project sponsors may petition the board if the Revitalization Coordinator or Puerto Rico agencies fail to expedite the project as envisioned by this title. If the coordinator or an agency has failed to comply with the process, the board may direct officials to comply with the process and take necessary enforcement actions.\n\nCritical projects approved prior to the termination of the board must continue to receive expedited service after the termination of the board.\n\n(Sec. 505) At the request of the Revitalization Coordinator, each federal agency with jurisdiction over the permitting, or administrative or environmental review of private or public projects in Puerto Rico must designate a liaison to the Revitalization Coordinator and expedite to the greatest extent possible the completion of any required federal action connected to a critical project.\n\n(Sec. 506) This section provides an expedited judicial review process for any claim brought under Title V.\n\n(Sec. 507) Nothing in this title is intended to change or alter federal legal requirements or laws.\n\nTITLE VI--CREDITOR COLLECTIVE ACTION\n\n(Sec. 601) This section establishes a voluntary process for debt restructuring by debtors and creditors in a territory or territorial instrumentality covered by this bill. The board must divide creditors into pools based on the characteristics of the debt, and each pool may vote on a plan to restructure the debt known as a qualifying modification. If at least two-thirds of the outstanding principal amount of a pool agrees with the plan, the pool may file a petition in court to bind the dissenting bondholders to the modification.\n\n(Sec. 602 This section specifies that in any judicial proceeding regarding this title, U.S. laws apply without regard to any law of any international or foreign jurisdiction.\n\nTITLE VII--SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PERMANENT, PRO-GROWTH FISCAL REFORMS\n\n(Sec. 701) This section expresses the sense of the Congress that any durable solution for Puerto Rico's fiscal and economic crisis should include permanent, pro-growth fiscal reforms that feature, among other elements, a free flow of capital between U.S possessions and the rest of the United States.",
