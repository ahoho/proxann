Ilyushin Il-32 = The Ilyushin Il-32 was a Soviet heavy military glider developed after World War II to deliver 7,000 kg ( 15,000 lb ) of cargo. To facilitate loading and unloading the glider 's nose and tail sections were hinged to swing sideways. The Il-32 required a four-engined aircraft to tow it safely ; it was canceled when it became clear that no such tug was going to be available after the Tupolev Tu-75 and Ilyushin Il-18 programs were both canceled because of shortages of their intended Shvetsov ASh-73 engines. = = Development = = After the end of World War II the Soviets devoted a considerable amount of effort to developing heavy transport gliders to deliver troops during an airborne assault.

Lockheed XF-104 = The Lockheed XF-104 was a single-engine, high-performance, supersonic interceptor prototype for a United States Air Force ( USAF ) series of lightweight and simple fighters. Only two aircraft were built, one aircraft was used primarily for aerodynamic research and the other served as an armament testbed. Both prototypes were destroyed in accidents during testing. The XF-104 was the forerunner of over 2,500 Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. During the Korean War, USAF fighter pilots were outclassed by MiG-equipped Soviet pilots. Lockheed engineers, led by Kelly Johnson, designed and submitted a novel design to the Air Force.

Document B, the Lockheed XF-104, is more closely related to the category of fighter aircraft. It specifically describes a prototype fighter aircraft designed for the United States Air Force, highlighting its role as a high-performance interceptor. In contrast, Document A discusses the Ilyushin Il-32, which is a military glider and not a fighter aircraft, focusing on cargo delivery rather than combat capabilities.

1973 Pacific hurricane season = The 1973 Pacific hurricane season was an event in tropical cyclone meteorology.

The most serious of these was Hurricane Irah, which downed power and communication lines in parts of the Baja California Peninsula ; the other landfalling storms caused rain and some flooding. No tropical cyclone this season caused any deaths.

Neither document is directly related to professional wrestling. However, Document A discusses a swimmer and Document B discusses a hurricane season, both of which are unrelated to the category. Since both documents are irrelevant, I cannot determine a closer relation to professional wrestling.

Espantito 's real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.

Both documents discuss professional wrestlers, but DOCUMENT_A focuses on Gregory Helms, detailing his career in major wrestling promotions like WWE and TNA, which are significant in the context of professional wrestling events. DOCUMENT_B, while also about a wrestler, discusses Espantito, a luchador in the Mini-Estrella division, which is more niche. Given the broader recognition and impact of Gregory Helms in major wrestling promotions, DOCUMENT_A is more closely related to the category of professional wrestling events and wrestlers.

Document A focuses on Magnus Carlsen, a prominent figure in the world of chess, which is considered a sport. His achievements and status as a World Chess Champion align with the theme of "Sports Legends." Document B discusses the Georgetown Hoyas, a college athletics program, which while related to sports, does not highlight a single legendary figure in the same way. Therefore, Document A is more closely related to the category of Sports Legends.
